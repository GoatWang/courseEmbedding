financial llc  million for widespread supervisory failures related to complex products sales trade surveillance and trade confirmations delivery lpl ordered to pay approximately  million in restitution to customers washington — the financial industry regulatory authority finra announced today that it has censured lpl financial llc and fined it  million for broad supervisory failures in a number of key areas including the sales of nontraditional exchangetraded funds etfs certain variable annuity contracts nontraded real estate investment trusts reits and other complex products as well as its failure to monitor and report trades and deliver to customers more than  million trade confirmations in addition to the fine finra ordered lpl to pay approximately  million in restitution to certain customers who purchased nontraditional etfs the firm may pay additional compensation to etf purchasers pending a review of its etf systems and procedures brad bennett finra executive vice president and chief of enforcement said lpls supervisory breakdowns resulted from a sustained failure to devote sufficient resources to compliance programs integral to numerous aspects of its business with todays action finra reaffirms that there is little room in the industry for lax supervision and that it will not hesitate to order firms to review and correct substandard supervisory systems and controls and pay restitution to affected customers finra found that at various times spanning multiple years lpl failed to supervise sales of certain complex structured products including etfs variable annuities and nontraded reits with regard to nontraditional etfs the firm did not have a system to monitor the length of time that customers held these securities in their accounts did not enforce its limits on the concentration of those products in customer accounts and failed to ensure that all of its registered representatives were adequately trained on the risks of the products also lpl failed to supervise its sales of variable annuities in some instances permitting sales without disclosing surrender fees and in connection with certain mutual fund switch transactions it used an automated surveillance system that excluded these trades from supervisory review additionally lpl failed to supervise nontraded reits by among other things failing to identify accounts eligible for volume sales charge discounts finra also found that lpls systems to review trading activity in customer accounts were plagued by multiple deficiencies for example lpl used a surveillance system that failed to generate alerts for certain highrisk activity including lowpriced equity transactions actively traded securities and potential employee frontrunning the firm used a separate but flawed automated system to review its trade blotter that failed to provide trading activity past due for supervisory review lpl failed to deliver over  million confirmations for trades in  customer accounts in addition due to coding defects that remained undetected for nearly six weeks lpls antimoney laundering surveillance system failed to generate alerts for excessive atm withdrawals and atm withdrawals in foreign jurisdictions finra also found that lpl failed to report certain trades to finra and the msrb and failed to ensure it provided complete and accurate information to finra and to federal and state regulators concerning certain variable annuity transactions finra further found that lpl failed to reasonably supervise its advertising and other communications including its registered representatives use of consolidated reports lpl did not monitor the creation or use of consolidated reports and failed to ensure that these reports reflected complete and accurate information in settling this matter lpl neither admitted nor denied the charges but consented to the entry of finras findings investors can obtain more information about and the disciplinary record of

simplified brokerage ira solution and operational and practice management support san diego march   globe newswire  leading retail investment advisory firm and independent brokerdealer lpl financial llc a wholly owned subsidiary of lpl financial holdings inc nasdaqlpla today announced a portion of its preparatory work for the impending department of labor dol fiduciary rule the planned changes are intended to help advisors take proactive steps to adapt to this regulation enabling them to expand their services to more investors and to continue to provide needed financial advice and flexible solutions to their clients while we continue to advocate for a thoughtful resolution to the fiduciary issue—one that preserves investor choice—lpl recognizes that the dol rule will have implications for financial advisors and investors said dan arnold president lpl since last summer we have been preparing to ensure our advisors and the firm approach this opportunity from a position of strength regardless of the final outcome we expect demand for advisory services to increase going forward continued arnold we also believe that retirement investors will continue to benefit from a brokerage relationship and that the need for a brokerage offering will continue if these relationships can be supported under the dol rule the changes announced today position both lpl and our advisors for growth and increased market share while offering choice and flexibility to serve a range of investors seeking both ongoing and occasional advice changes the firm plans to implement include price reductions lpl plans to reduce the pricing of its centrally managed platforms in order to help advisors provide their services more costeffectively and grow their practices by reaching more investors in addition to the previouslyannounced elimination of the lpl research strategist fee and annual ira maintenance fee in its model wealth portfolios mwp advisory platform earlier this year the firm plans to further reduce mwp pricing in  the change is expected to lower the total cost of accessing quality financial advice for investors in some cases by nearly  compared to current pricing lower account minimums to help ensure that investors continue to have access to financial advice lpl plans to lower the account minimums in its optimum market portfolios omp advisory platform from  to  later this year as previously announced lpl eliminated the ira maintenance fee for omp at the start of this year  simplified mutualfund only brokerage ira offering in anticipation of the additional operational requirements the firm expects for direct business lpl is planning to create a simplified mutual fundonly brokerage ira offering to support the continued use of mutual funds in a brokerage relationship as an option for ira business this offering would allow lpl to support mutual funds previously held directly with manufacturers the new offering is not expected to have an annual ira maintenance fee  enhanced practice management capabilities to manage change the firm plans to provide specialized practice management support to help advisors manage through changes in their practices including licensing assistance and business analysis  operational enhancements to drive efficiency the firm is also planning simplified operational processes—such as keeping account numbers unchanged when accounts are transitioned from brokerage to advisory accounts—that will allow investors who want to convert their accounts to do so in a more streamlined way              while much uncertainty remains as to what the final dol rule will look like lpl is taking a proactive approach by making changes to our platform and capabilities that we believe will help advisors grow their practices and support more investors in need of financial advice said arnold we are proud to use our size and scale as a market leader to further strengthen the transparency and value lpl provides to investors and

herehomenewsroomnews releases news release for release  monday march   contacts  michelle ong   nancy condon   finra fines lpl financial llc  for supervisory failures related to sales of alternative investments washington — the financial industry regulatory authority finra announced today that it has fined lpl financial llc  for supervisory deficiencies related to the sales of alternative investment products including nontraded real estate investment trusts reits oil and gas partnerships business development companies bdcs hedge funds managed futures and other illiquid passthrough investments as part of the sanction lpl must also conduct a comprehensive review of its policies systems procedures and training and remedy the failures many alternative investments such as reits set forth concentration limits for investors in their offering documents in addition certain states have imposed concentration limits for investors in alternative investments lpl also established its own concentration guidelines for alternative investments however finra found that from january   to july   lpl failed to adequately supervise the sales of alternative investments that violated these concentration limits at first lpl used a manual process to review whether an investment complied with suitability requirements relying on information that was at times outdated and inaccurate the firm later implemented an automated system for review but that database contained flawed programming and was not updated in a timely manner to accurately reflect suitability standards lpl also did not adequately train its supervisory staff to analyze state suitability standards as part of their suitability reviews of alternative investments brad bennett finra executive vice president and chief of enforcement said in order to sell alternative investments a brokerdealer must tailor its supervisory system to these products lpl exposed customers to unacceptable risks by not having an adequate
