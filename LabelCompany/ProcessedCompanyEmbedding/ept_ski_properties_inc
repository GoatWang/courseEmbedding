initial public offering whats going on  jeff harbaugh  associates twitterfacebooklinkedin market watch column peak resort’s initial public offering what’s going on october   commentsin finance and accounting by jeffback on april th peak resorts filed an s with the securities and exchange commission sec to take the company public there have been four amendments since then with the latest filed september th here’s the link to that most current version of the s the company is not yet public but based on that filing is still working on the process it is by any measure not an easy time to take a company public skullcandy you’ll recall had to delay their offering a while due to market conditions i don’t think peak resorts is facing any better conditions peak resorts operates  ski areas in the midwest northeast and southeast us they had about  million skierboarder visits in the  season total revenues for the fiscal year ended april   were  million mount snow generated  of peak’s revenue and attitash  none of the other areas generated more than  lift tickets were  of total revenue and food and beverage  hotellodging represents only  of total revenue because peak’s areas are overnight drive ski areas and day ski areas they don’t have any of the areas characterized as fly destination areas   that’s part of their strategy as all their areas “…are located in or near metropolitan areas and target a regional market” they think their experience in acquiring integrating and managing areas is one of their competitive strengths and they expect to look for more acquisitions     numbers the s still has a lot of the usual holes in it they expect to raise about  million but we don’t have a proforma balance sheet yet showing what it will look like after the offering neither do we have an estimate of the share selling price or specifics as to how the proceeds will be used though they note that a chunk will be used to pay down debt we’ll get back to that   we do however have historical financials revenues for the three years ended april   and  were  million  million and  million respectively earnings from operations for the same three years were  million  million and  million as a percentage of revenue earnings from operations have grown from  to  to  over those three years note that their latest acquisition wildcat mountain was completed october of  so its results are included in the april   numbers   interest expense at  million was  of revenue in  in  it was  million or  of revenue the numbers for  are  million or  of revenue those numbers exclude for   million  million and  million of interest that was capitalized rather than expensed   taxable income was a loss of  in  there were profits in  and  of  million and  million respectively in  and  peak resorts was a subchapter s corporation so there’s no corporate income tax on the income statement those earnings or the loss flowed through to shareholders who are responsible for paying the taxes in  and  net income is therefore the same as taxable income for the company for the  fiscal year as part of doing this stock offering they converted to a c corporation and had to book a  million income tax provision that resulted in a loss of  million for the year but there’s some funky deferred tax stuff going on so if you can’t ignore the number you can’t take it as typical of their tax rate going forward either that is their tax rate will not be  of income in future years   that would be discouraging   ok balance sheet there was a time when i wrote a lot more about winter resorts for sam back then i used to tear my hair out trying to decipher balance sheets with negative current ratios and other interesting stuff finally i reconciled myself to the inevitable gyrations of winter resort balance sheets and focused more on cash flow   peak resorts has  million in long term debt as of april   as part of current liabilities they have an additional  million representing the current portion of longterm debt and capitalized lease obligations that is they’ve got to pay or refinance  million of debt before april   basically it’s one big payment due april     also at april   they had  million of cash on their balance sheet if a winter resort was ever going to be flush with cash it would be at april   million of that cash is restricted that restricted cash is the “…interest due on our outstanding debt with ept our primary lender and rent under the lease for the mad river resort for the  months following april ” so that  million is not available for paying down the debt due this fiscal year    a little footnote diving tells us that this is the only year through the  fiscal year where peak resorts has to pay off a big chunk of debt in none of the other years through  does the amount of principal due even get to  million in the s peak resorts says they “…have  million under various loan agreements to fund expansion and capital expenditures at our ski areas we expect that our liquidity needs for the near term and the next fiscal year will be met by continued use of operating cash flows primarily those generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and additional borrowings under our loan arrangements as needed”   peak resorts is telling us they can pay off the  million in long term debt due this year from resources created or available to them from the normal operation of their business good but i’ve got questions   we know the  million in restricted cash isn’t available for debt repayment the  million available under existing lines seems to be for expansion and capital expenditures and that would be borrowings from basically the same people they already owe the  million to ept see below the consolidated statement of cash flow for  shows net cash provided by operating activities of  million but they used  million in investing activities most of which was additions to property and equipment and land held for development capital expenditures in the current fiscal year are projected to be  million we also know because they tell us that “…the repayment of this debt will not result in additional borrowing capacity under these credit facilities but may create available collateral for future borrowing if necessary”   overall interest rate on the debt is around  and some of it is escalating given that interest rate and the amount of interest they are paying as described above you can see why they are planning to use some part of the offering proceeds to pay down debt it will do wonders for their cash flow and bottom line   who’s ept entertainment properties trust is peak resort’s only lender it describes itself as“…a specialty real estate investment trust reit that invests in properties in select categories which require unique industry knowledge and offer stable and attractive returns” it’s traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol epr if you go to the link above and click on “portfolio” along the top you’ll come to a map that shows all their properties if you then click on the left side on “metropolitan ski parks” the map will show nine ski areas that are all part of peak resorts   i’m told by people wiser than i that what’s happened reit wise in the winter resort business is that there was a trend for reit operators to buy areas and then lease them back to the operator these resorts are shown as part of ept’s portfolio but they aren’t all owned by ept if they were then peak resorts wouldn’t have on its balance sheet the debt from buying them it would just be making lease payments and be responsible for running them   the debt that peak resorts has to repay to ept this fiscal year is the “mount snow development debt” it’s due april   it “…represents obligations incurred to provide financing for the acquisition of land at mount snow that is in development stages” under an agreement dated april   ept lent peak resorts  million which i assume was used to buy that land an april   modification to the agreement increased the amount to  million that increase included  million in accrued interest to the date of the modification  million plus  million is more or less the amount that’s due next april   you may have noticed that the economy hasn’t exactly improved since april   i would guess that any land peak resorts bought is worth a bit less than it was i suppose it’s unclear if it would make economic sense to develop it peak resorts balance sheet shows  million in land held for development i wonder if that’s the mount snow land if so then none has been developed and sold if it had been the proceeds are required to be used to pay down the debt   on october   peak resorts entered into an option agreement with ept ski properties inc a subsidiary of ept giving ept ski properties an option to purchase hidden valley snow creek brandywine boston mills and the part of paoli peaks owned by peak resorts at prices specified in the agreement the same agreement would allow them to assume peak’s leases at big boulder jack frost and paoli peaks it could exercise any or all of these options on or after april   if ept did exercise any of those options it would under the agreement immediately lease the areas it bought back to peak resorts   one wonders if the prices in that agreement under which ept could exercise its options are as attractive to ept now as they were when the agreement was signed in    so what’s going on all i know is what i read nobody at peak resorts can talk to me because they are in the middle of the offering process down to the earnings from operations line peak resorts results look good and improving and the peak resorts managers are known as good operators   but the interest burden is substantial and they’ve got  million in principal to pay off by next april st it looks to me like the deal made with ept in  doesn’t seem quite so good in ’s economic reality and hasn’t worked out the way both sides hoped it would   i heard on cnbc yesterday that the first ipo in two months had just been completed a testament to how tough this market is i would expect you wouldn’t try to do one now if you didn’t need to i hope the next amendment gives us not only a proforma balance sheet showing some debt repaid from the offering proceeds but a proforma income statement that shows what will be significant improvement of their bottom line from a lot less interest expense and a normalized tax rate       related posts the last intrawest annual report one benefit of being bought margins percentages and dollars where

says october   at  am wow great insight this maybe the most interesting article i’ve read in months i am so happy sam made it possible for me to read it jeff says october   at  am thanks robin you can if you want sign up on my web site to be notified of everything i post jeff hugh says november   at  am this is an excellent bit of analysis and you should be commended one additional area that you should look into is the management of the various areas if “acquiring integrating and managing” is the core strength of this company then one might expect some very high quality managers at these  areas upon investigation you will find that the majority of the areas are managed by the offspring of the founders further insight of the qualifications of the personnel of peaks resorts would well be needed before an investment in this ipo is prudent jeff says november   at  pm hi hugh management always matters in the case of peak resorts they are generally considered to be good managers as far as i know their issue is the real estate and the deal with the reit not their management of their resorts thanks for the comment j sam says april   at  am jeff now that it’s april  what’s your take on this situation…considering peak never did the ipo jeff says april   at  pm hi sam as the ipo never went through there’s no public information so i don’t know what’s happening as you recall we learned from peak’s s filing that they had a payment due their lender ept of about  million on april st meanwhile between when i wrote the article and now peak has acquired another resort and committed to some millions of dollars in facilities improvement either i misinterpreted what i was reading in the s or and this is complete speculation on my part there’s been some kind of deal with ept that we don’t have to be told about as peak isn’t public thanks for asking i’ll see what i can find out j comments are closed consulting jeff harbaugh has more than  years spent developing strategies to
