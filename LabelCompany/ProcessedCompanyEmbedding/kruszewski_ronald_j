nicolaus on august   claiming the firm duped five wisconsin school districts into buying  million in unsuitable securities tied to collateralized debt obligations the investments which the school districts had purchased in  with  million in borrowed funds and  million of their own money were far more risky than stifel nicolaus advertised to the school districts the sec alleged and the firm hid the risks “through a series of falsehoods and misrepresentations the school districts credit ratings were lowered and they lost their investments which were intended to fund school employees retirement benefits stifel nicolaus said in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed by the misplaced action” and that it would “vigorously defend” its behavior in the transactions the sec said the firm had claimed that the investments were so safe that it would take  enrons or some other unexpected catastrophe for the investments to fail but the first increment of securities did badly and credit agencies issued a negative watch on part of the portfolio within days of its closing on march   it was announced that a settlement had been reached with the school districts to jointly pursue a
