what to make of the us securities and exchange commission’s plans if any on regulating coinvestments continue reading on pe hub writes sponsors and their limited partners aren’t sure what to make of the us securities and exchange commission’s plans if any on regulating coinvestments the sec which has been gathering information about how coinvestments work could of course do nothing it could require sponsors to disclose more information to investors about their coinvestment policies or while seen as unlikely the agency could require sponsors to handle coinvestments in a particular way such as by notifying all investors of an opportunity in advance and giving them an equal chance at buying in during a public meeting in january igor rozenblit specialist with the sec division of enforcement in the asset management unit said he believes general partners should let lps know on what basis they are going to offer opportunities for lps to coinvest in deals alongside sponsors he also said gps should disclose to all lps when a coinvestment is going to happen “let them know in a timely enough way so if someone didn’t get a coinvestment opportunity it gives them a chance to call and complain” and try to convince the gp to allocate them a piece of the coinvestment rozenblit said the sec declined to comment further on the subject for this article generally gps pick and choose which lps to coinvest with—the ones that they know to be reliable and that can make a decision quickly on whether or not to join a deal some gps survey lps to find out which ones want coinvestment it would be unusual for a gp to offer every lp in a fund the opportunity to coinvest sources said one source with knowledge of the sec’s thinking said “chances are they need more information to decide what the policy will be that bodes well in my opinion…that means they’re not regulating first and figuring it out later” it is unlikely sources said that the sec would come up with a hardline rule governing coinvesting the sec would likely be satisfied if gps were transparent about coinvesting such as by disclosing how the fund determines who to participate and how opportunities are allocated between the fund and coinvestors said kerry burke a partner in the corporate and securities practice at law firm covington  burling llp “this has become more of a focus as more people start to think through these issues” burke said adding she doesn’t think rules restricting coinvestments are imminent “i don’t see how you would do that effectively” coinvesting appears to becoming more popular as limited partners look for a way to reduce fees and gain more exposure to the deals of favorite sponsors coller capital’s winter  global private equity barometer which surveyed  private equity investors from around the world found that more than half had coinvested with their gps in the last two years also the “typical” lp invests  percent of its total private equity commitment directly into private companies either solo or in coinvestments within the next three to five years that number is expected to jump to  percent according to coller capital’s survey while affording opportunities for strong returns coinvestments do come with risks a recent draft academic paper by three professors including two from harvard business school found that coinvestments underperformed fund investments over the  year study period the “poor performance appears to result from fund managers’ selective offering of deals at market peaks” the authors wrote the paper was coauthored by lily fang associate professor of finance at insead victoria ivashina associate professor of finance at harvard business school and josh lerner professor of investment banking at harvard business school it will be interesting to see if the sec eventually comes out with guidance on coinvestments but from what pehub has heard the industry—both gps and lps—would really prefer if the agency backed off this
