for all expenses incurred in this offering while we offer what we feel to be the most efficient and cost effective drug screening product on the market today we do face intense competition from other companies who offer similar products competing one step products meaning one device with multiple drug screening panels include the following drugconfirm advanced  panel americup  panel eco ii  panel clia screen  panel tcup  panel ez split key cup  panel centralcheck  panel nxstep  panel and others we believe the udt cup we offer to customers differs from most other drug screening products on the market and may serve as a better alternative to many such products due to the fact that it can provide test results in a lesser amount of time one minute versus four to ten minutes for most competing products additionally the udt cup has an internal seal that may prevent cross contamination of the urine sample when shaken or jostled during testing this is a feature that most other competing drug screening kits do not have the udt cup’s design is also designed in a way that can make it more suitable for use among both males and females this however is our own opinion the udt cup also comes standard with a temperature strip included as part of the kit something most other drug screening kits offer but only as an “add on feature” for an additional cost company description the company was

incflorida” and opulent acquisition inc a delaware corporation “ihealthcare incdelaware” or the “surviving corporation jointly the “constituent corporations” effective as of april      ihealthcare incflorida merged with and into ihealthcare incdelaware with ihealthcare incdelaware continuing as the surviving corporation   the board of directors of the constituent corporations declared the merger agreement advisable fair to and in the best interests of the constituent corporations and have approved the merger   immediately prior to the merger the company was a “shell company” as such term is defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act”   as of the effective date of the merger we the company ihealthcare inc “fka opulent acquisition” have adopted the business plan of what was ihealthcare incflorida which is the sale of goods in the healthcare sector we currently have a distribution agreement with innovate laboratory solutions also known as “ils” to supply us a product known as the “udt cup” also herein known as multipanel  urinalysis cup or drug of abuse “doa” cup ils has agreed to provide us the right to purchase the udt cup at special pricing in certain quantities ils is the developer of the udt cup and exclusive global supplier of the udt cup however they have the udt cup manufactured by a third party manufacturer of which they have not and will not disclose to us due to confidentiality ils does however have the authority and right to control who manufactures the udt cup   we have begun conducting sales of the udt cup but our sales have been minimal our plans relating to this can be found in the above section titled “business”   we believe we need to develop a more concrete marketing plan so that we can sell the goods on a large scale to more than one consumer from time to time we also believe we need to hire additional staff of which we have begun to do so to date we have hired what we refer to as an “svp of operations” this individual is responsible for formulating our marketing plan moving forward amending it as seen fit contacting and facilitating relationships with potential wholesalers and overseeing any other sales employees we currently have or may hire in the future currently we have two sales team members that are commission based   as of december   ihealthcare inc a florida company

fiscal year end the company had received  for common stock issued of which  was deposited into escrow for the purchase of opulent acquistion inc a delaware company   we believe that to develop the company’s current business plan that we must raise capital in the next twelve months the company has no immediate plans to raise such capital thus far the company has relied solely on funds provided by our officers and directors noel mijares our chief executive officer president director and david a bingaman our chief operating officer vice president and secretary if we can not raise such funds we will have to continue to rely on funds provided to us by our officers and directors   for the three months ended august   and  we had revenue in the three month period ending august   of  and  for the three month period ending august   our operating expenses totaled  and  respectively our operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees for both periods the variance in operating expenses is due to the fact that there have been increased professional fees for the three months ended august   as opposed to the same period the year prior our net loss for the three months ended august   was  and was  for the three months ended august   for the nine months ended august   and  we had revenue in the nine month period ending august   of  and  for the nine month period ending august   our operating expenses totaled  and  respectively our operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees for both periods the variance in operating expenses is due to the fact that there have been increased professional fees for the nine months ended august   as opposed to the same period the year prior our net loss for the nine months ended august   was  and was  for the nine months ended august    we believe that to develop the company’s current business plan that we must raise capital in the next twelve months the company has no immediate plans to raise such capital

factors and other information in this prospectus relating to our business before deciding to invest in our common stock   this offering and any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   we consider the following to be the material risks for an investor regarding this offering our company should be viewed as a highrisk investment and speculative in nature an investment in our common stock may result in a complete loss of the invested amount   an investment in our common stock is highly speculative and should only be made by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this report before deciding to become a holder of our common stock if any of the following risks actually occur our business and financial results could be negatively affected to a significant extent   risks relating to our company and our industry   we will require additional funds in the future to achieve our current business strategy and our inability to obtain funding will cause our business to fail   we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity sales in order to fund our future these financings may not be available when needed even if these financings are available it may be on terms that we deem unacceptable or are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value dividend preferences liquidation preferences or other terms our inability to obtain financing would have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our current business plan and develop our product line and as a result could require us to diminish or suspend our operations and possibly cease our existence   even if we are successful in raising capital in the future we will likely need to raise additional capital to continue andor expand our operations if we do not raise the additional capital the value of any investment in our company may become worthless in the event we do not raise additional capital from conventional sources it is likely that we may need to scale back or curtail implementing our business plan   as of our most recent quarter end we had minimal cash andor cash equivalents as a result of having minimal cash to fund our business we have and continue to be primarily reliant upon our officers and directors to fund our operations we believe our officers and directors will continue to fund our operations for a period of twelve months although there is no guarantee that they will do so   we have generated only minimal revenues to date since our inception our independent registered public accounting firm malonebailey llp has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report in regards to our operations   in their audit report our pcaob auditor malonebailey llp issued a going concern opinion in regards to our operations the going concern was issued due to the fact we have suffered a net loss and do not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue the going concern issued by our independent auditor may have a negative impact on the value of our common stock although the extent of this negative impact is not known at this time additionally we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing as a result of the going concern   we are a startup stage company our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to commence a commercially viable operation and to achieve profitability since our inception we have generated minimal revenues and currently have only limited operations as we are presently in the planning stage of our business development as an exploration stage company these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we may not be able to generate revenues in the future and as a result the value of our common stock may become worthless there are no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional capital or successfully developing and commercializing our products and becoming profitable   we hold the distribution rights to the udt cup but we rely on the services of a third party supplier ils in order to supply the products we offer for sale ils has the right to control who manufacturers the product the udt cup which we offer for resale   due to the fact that we rely upon ils in order to supply the udt cups which our company is currently selling we face inherent risks due to the fact that we do not hold the patents or manufacturing rights to the product if there is a disruption in the supply of udt cups caused by any number of situations which could arise with ils then we may have difficulty successfully implementing our business plan or meeting the demand for our products when we have commenced operations these disruptions could include but are not strictly limited to shipping difficulties or setbacks price increases which would require renegotiation of terms manufacturing difficulties on the part of ils etc additionally should ils go out of business then we will be forced to find an alternative product for sale and an alternative manufacturer which could delay our business operations substantially or force us to cease operations entirely   ils is solely responsible for the shipping of the udt cups   we will not be responsible for shipping the udt cups to any consumers ils is solely responsible for shipping the udt cups and any disruptions or hold ups in relation to the shipping of the udt cups could cause a disruption that will negatively impact our operations consumers may lose faith in our ability to have udt cups reliably shipped through situations that are beyond our control   due to the fact that we do not have a concrete advertising plan we may not see the sales we anticipate if our advertising plan is not as effective as we plan   we are in the planning stages of our advertising strategy and as such we do not have a definitive plan for how we will conduct our marketing efforts we plan to utilize internet media outlets and social media but our plans need to be further developed before we can begin implementing them fully as such we may see fewer sales than we anticipate if our marketing plan once implemented is not as effective as we plan   we cannot identify the manufacturer of the udt cup   due to our agreement with ils whereby they provide and will continue to provide us with udt cups they have withheld the name of the manufacturer of the udt cup ils acts as the distributor who supplies us with physical inventory due to the fact that we have no means through which we can identify the manufacturer there are inherent related risks we rely on ils to verify that the manufacturer complies with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to a manufacturer of a medical device and we can not directly verify this ourselves while we do not believe we are subject to any potential product liability because we believe that it will be either the manufacturer or ils who will be responsible for product liability we cannot accurately assess the manufacturer’s financial ability to compensate us for any potential liabilities related to the product    table of contents   our growth strategy is untested unproven and as of this point in time not fully developed   we intend to grow our business starting in the south eastern states of the united states and from there spread outward into the north and eventually westward until we spread throughout the entire country at which point we will begin exploring international options however our exact strategy for how we will grow in this manner is currently in development alongside our marketing plan and we can offer no assurances that we will be effective in growing at the rate we anticipate which could result in lower profit margins if any   we have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays that we may encounter because we are a small developing company as a result we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to develop as we have planned   we have only recently adopted a bona fide business plan we have limited financial resources and limited assets the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses and difficulties in development of a customer base nationally attaining and retaining customers and obtaining financing to meet the needs of our plan of operations since we have a limited operating history we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities   we are an early stage company with an unproven business strategy and may never be able to fully implement our business plan or achieve profitability   we are at an early stage of development of our operations as a company we have only recently started to operate business activities and have generated minimal revenue from such operations a commitment of substantial resources to conduct timeconsuming research in many respects will be required if we are to complete the development of our company into one that is more profitable there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully implement our business plan at reasonable costs or successfully operate we expect it will take several years to implement our business plan fully if at all   our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses   we have a very limited operating history as a result it is difficult to accurately forecast our net sales and plan our operating expenses this inability could cause our net income if there is any income at all in a given quarter to be lower than expected   we operate in a highly competitive environment and if we are unable to compete with our competitors our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected   we operate in a highly competitive environment our competition includes all other companies that are in the business of the drug screening market a highly competitive environment could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects   because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations   due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations   we expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate   we expect our net sales and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors including unexpected changes in   • demand for our drug screening products • our ability to obtain new and retain existing customers • our ability to manage our services • general economic conditions • advertising and other marketing costs   as a result of the variability of these and other factors our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors    table of contents   our future success is dependent on our implementation of our business plan we have many significant steps still to take   our success will depend on large part in our success in achieving several important steps in the implementation of our business plan including the following acquiring business information development of a customer base development of relationships with consumers and management of business process if we are not successful we will not be able to fully implement or expand our business plan    our growth will place significant strains on our resources   the company is currently in the exploration stage with only limited operations and has generated only minimal revenue since inception the companys growth if any is expected to place a significant strain on the companys managerial operational and financial resources moving forward the companys systems procedures or controls may not be adequate to support the companys operations andor the company may be unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement its business plan if the company is unable to manage growth effectively the companys business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected   our future success is dependent in part on the performance and continued services of noel mijares our chief executive officer as well as david a bingaman our chief operating officer without their continued service we may be forced to interrupt or eventually cease our operations   we are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience abilities and continued services of both noel mijares and david a bingaman the loss of either of their services would delay our business operations substantially   our president and ceo noel mijares is also the president and ceo of pharma health corp unisources discovery and the subpoena company mr mijares’s other business interests may result in him being unable to devote enough hours to the company to further advance operations   our president and ceo noel mijares is also the president and ceo of pharma health corp unisources discovery and the subpoena company mr mijares’s other business interests may result in him being unable to devote enough hours to the company to further advance operations despite mr noel mijares’s other business ventures he believes he is still able to devote  hours per week to the company’s operations however there is the possibility that he may not be able to do so if this were to occur it could negatively impact our operations and could cause our results of operations to suffer as a result   due to article ix of our certificate of incorporation investors may have difficulty bringing any action against us in a judicial forum   article ix of our certificate of incorporation states that “unless we the “company” also referred to herein as “the corporation” consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be the sole and exclusive forum for  any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation  any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by or other wrongdoing by any director officer employee or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation’s stockholders  any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law or the corporation’s restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws  any action to interpret apply enforce or determine the validity of the corporation’s restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or  any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine in each such case subject to said court of chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this article ix due to this provision if a shareholder does not reside in delaware then they may face difficulty bringing any action against us in a judicial forum due to the fact that all such claims must be made in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in addition to the potential inconvenience of physical location shareholders may find this choice of forum inconvenient for any number of reasons which are subjective to the shareholders this exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes this may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against the company and its officers directors or other employees   the recently enacted jobs act will allow the company to postpone the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the sec   the recently enacted jobs act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies” the company meets the definition of an “emerging growth company” and so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” it will among other things   be exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting   be exempt from the say on pay” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers and the say on golden parachute” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and certain disclosure requirements of the doddfrank act relating to compensation of chief executive officers   be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation and   be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board the “pcaob” requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements     although the company is still evaluating the jobs act it currently intends to take advantage of all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” the company has elected not to opt out of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under section b of the jobs act among other things this means that the companys independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected likewise so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” the company may elect not to provide certain information including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers which would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the sec which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the company as a result investor confidence in the company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected   notwithstanding the above we are also currently a “smaller reporting company” meaning that we are not an investment company an assetbacked issuer or a majorityowned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than  million and annual revenues of less than  million during the most recently completed fiscal year in the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company” at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company” the disclosure we will be required to provide in our sec filings will increase but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company” specifically similar to “emerging growth companies” “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings are exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their sec filings including among other things being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports decreased disclosures in our sec filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze the company’s results of operations and financial prospects    table of contents   we are an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million    risks relating to the company’s securities   we may never have a public market for our common stock or may never trade on a recognized exchange therefore you may be unable to liquidate your investment in our stock   there is no established public trading market for our securities our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system   in order for our shares to be quoted a market maker must agree to file the necessary documents with the national association of securities dealers which operates the otcbb in addition it is possible that such application for quotation may not be approved and even if approved it is possible that a regular trading market will not develop or that if it did develop will be sustained in the absence of a trading market an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment   we may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock of which  shares are issued and outstanding as of november   the future issuance of our common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our then existing stockholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   we may issue shares of preferred stock in the future that may adversely impact your rights as holders of our common stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue  shares of series a and  series b preferred stock each holder preferred b stock shall have the right to one  vote per share of held of record by such holder and each holder of series a preferred stock shall have the right to one hundred  votes per share of series a preferred stock currently we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding however the issuance of any of our preferred stock may influence the value of your investment   we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth therefore you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares   we may be exposed to potential risks resulting from requirements under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of    as a reporting company we are required pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we do not have a sufficient number of employees to segregate responsibilities and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of employees   we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result our directors have the ability among other things to determine their own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations    table of contents   the costs to meet our reporting and other requirements as a public company subject to the exchange act of  is and will be substantial and may result in us having insufficient funds to expand our business or even to meet routine business obligations   as a public entity subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act of  we will continue to incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements we estimate that these costs will range up to  per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases as a result we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations   state securities laws may limit secondary trading which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell shares   secondary trading in our common stock may not be possible in any state until the common stock is qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals is available for secondary trading in the state if we fail to register or qualify or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of the common stock in any particular state the common stock cannot be offered or sold to or purchased by a resident of that state in the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock the liquidity for the common stock could be significantly impacted   risks relating to this offering investors cannot withdraw funds once invested and will not receive a refund investors do not have the right to withdraw invested funds subscription payments will be paid to ihealthcare inc and held in our corporate bank account if the subscription agreements are in good order and the company accepts the investor’s investment therefore once an investment is made investors will not have the use or right to return of such funds   the trading in our shares will be regulated by the securities and exchange commission rule g which established the definition of a “penny stock” the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and must deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase   due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering   we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otcqb the otcqb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcqb is not a issuer listing services market or exchange although the otcqb does not have any listing requirements per se to be eligible for quotation on the otcqb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otcqb market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcqb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between the company and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment   we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all    the estimated cost of this registration statement is  we will have to utilize funds from our officers and directors who have verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process we are required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otcqb to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otcqb     table of contents industry overview   this prospectus includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates although we believe the publications and reports are reliable we have not independently verified the data our internal data estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate and our management’s understanding of industry conditions   as of the date of the preparation of this prospectus these and other independent government and trade publications cited herein are publicly available on the internet without charge upon request the company will also provide copies of such sources cited herein   drug screening industry   the drug screening marketsize is expected to grow from  billion in  to  billion by  at a cagr compound annual growth rate of  major factors driving the growth of this market include higher usage of alcohol prescribed drugs illicit drugs and a growing aging population that leads to increased use of alcohol and prescription drugs funding by the us federal governments for drug testing enactment of stringent laws in developed countries and growing awareness for drug testing in developing nations has increased the awareness surrounding testing patients on a regular basis in addition emerging economies such as india china and brazil present an array of opportunities for this market   currently north america dominates the drug screening market with the us accounting for a major market share however the asiapacific region is poised to grow at the highest cagr during the forecast period we believe there to be great growth potential in the asian market due to development of advanced drug and alcohol screening devices in japan rising awareness regarding the importance of drug and alcohol screening and increasing disposable income levels in various countries in asia    the north american laboratory as well as onsite testing market has increased by more than  cagr between  and  with past technologies it was necessary to retest a positive lab test due to potential inaccuracies which resulted in a higher cost new technology enables employers to retest positive results inexpensively and immediately with the same and new samples from the subject thus reducing the overall cost    forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus   description of business    description of business   we ihealthcare inc are a company that sells and distribute products in the healthcare sector we currently hold a distribution agreement with innovate laboratory solutions also known as “ils” to supply us a product known as the “udt cup” also herein known as multipanel  urinalysis cup or drug of abuse “doa” cup ils has agreed to provide us the right to purchase the udt cup at special pricing in certain quantities ils is the developer of the udt cup and exclusive global supplier of the udt cup however they have the udt cup manufactured by a third party manufacturer of which they have not and will not disclose to us due to confidentiality ils does however have the authority and right to control who manufactures the udt cup    we entered into and consummated the above agreement with ils to sell us the udt cup at certain price points beginning on february   the term of the agreement is for a span of three years we may buy the udt cup in varying quantities from ils provided they have enough inventory to fill our order otherwise we will be limited to whatever they may have available at that time of order   if both parties in writing agree to it they can terminate the above mentioned agreement our agreement with ils also has a section titled “termination for cause” this section states that   “a either party will have the right to terminate the agreement at any time if the other party is in breach of any material term and which such party fails to cure within  calendar day after receiving written notice of the breach and the party’s intention to terminate    b ils shall have the right to terminate this agreement if distributor    becomes insolvent  discontinues its business or  becomes the subject of any voluntary or involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy liquidation dissolution receivership attachment or composition for the benefit of creditors such termination will become effective upon the nonterminating party’s receipt of a notice of termination at any time after the specified event   such termination will become effective upon the nonterminating party’s receipt of a notice of termination at any time after the specified event”   per our agreement with ils there are no specific laws which we have expressly agreed to abide by however in general we have agreed to comply with all federal and state healthcare laws rules and regulations including but not limited to stark antikickback false claims act etc noncompliance of any rule regulation or law including the aforementioned could in some way cause us to become the party of a civil or criminal suit generally speaking when one is a party in any civil or criminal suit it may negatively affect that party’s image and may also cause them financial harm if this were to happen to us we may have to curtail operations or allocate funds towards defending ourselves in any such case if we were found guilty of violating any rule regulation or law our operations may be terminated suspended or harmed in some capacity the udt cup’s intended purpose is for drug screening   as of the date of this report we have paid ils  for the purchase of udt cups this figure will increase as we purchase more udt cups in the future ils has paid us no monies to date   mission and vision   at ihealthcare inc we are dedicated to reducing costs and improving the quality of medical care through innovative products and services in specialized markets that are currently being underserved by our competition our primary focus is to establish sustainable market penetration one product at a time simultaneously we

as lateral flow immunochromatographic assays are simple devices intended to detect the presence or absence of a target analyte in sample matrix without the need for specialized and costly equipment  typically these tests are used for medical diagnostics either for home testing point of care testing or laboratory use in this case drugs of abuse testing   the technology is based on a series of capillary beds such as pieces of porous paper microstructured polymer or sintered polymer each of these elements has the capacity to transport fluid eg urine spontaneously the first element the sample pad acts as a sponge and holds an excess of sample fluid once soaked the fluid migrates to the second element conjugate pad in which the manufacturer has stored the socalled conjugate a dried format of bioactive particles see below in a saltsugar matrix that contains everything to guarantee an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule eg an antigen and its chemical partner eg antibody that has been immobilized on the particles surface   while the sample fluid dissolves the saltsugar matrix it also dissolves the particles and in one combined transport action the sample and conjugate mix while flowing through the porous structure in this way the analyte binds to the particles while migrating further through the third capillary bed this material has one or more areas often called stripes where a third molecule has been immobilized by the manufacturer by the time the sampleconjugate mix reaches these strips analyte has been bound on the particle and the third capture molecule binds the complex after a while when more and more fluid has passed the stripes particles accumulate and the stripearea changes color    typically there are at least two stripes one the control that captures any particle and thereby shows that reaction conditions and technology worked fine the second contains a specific capture molecule and only captures those particles onto which an analyte molecule has been immobilized after passing these reaction zones the fluid enters the final porous material the wick that simply acts as a waste container lateral flow then means the combination of these proprietary processes that scientifically allowcreate the draw or flow of the sample laterally across these membranes for analysis         sample diagrams of a generic lateral flow process for illustration only   additional feature definitions   fda cleared cleared medical devices these medical devices are ones that the fda has determined to be substantially equivalent to

the udt cup that we currently sell may be purchased by any individual   uses and other information regarding the udt cup   the udt cup is intended for detecting the presence of drugs in urine any situation it may be necessary to screen an individual for drug use would be an appropriate time to utilize the udt cup examples include but are not limited to screening potential employees current employees use in drug treatment centers or medical clinics   potential purchasers of the udt cup can be anyone however most notably we anticipate it will be primarily medical clinics hospitals drug rehabilitation centers employers physician groups transportation companies used to test drivers for drug use or wholesalers who will resell the product at a higher cost to make a profit we have no intentions of limiting who can buy the udt cup   the udt cup works by having the individual being tested   the udt cup is comprised of two elements the test cup and dipcard   rapid singlemultidrug

of title  part  our supplier of the udt cup ils has made previous sales of the udt cup to customers in the past primarily in florida the customers comprised of a combination of health centers rehabilitation clinics and private parties   we are only a distributor reseller of the udt cup as a distributor of the udt cup we are not required to have fda approvals due to the clia waivers that are present for each panel of the udt cup our supplier innovative laboratory solutions however has obtained the following in order to act as a global supplier importer and exporter of the udt cup drug of abuse cup sbd  fda user fee organization   approved  under the mdufa medical device user fee act  competition   while we offer what we feel to be the most efficient and cost effective drug screening product on the market today we do face intense competition from other companies who offer similar products   competing one step products meaning one device with multiple drug screening panels include the following drugconfirm advanced  panel americup  panel eco ii  panel clia screen  panel tcup  panel ez split key cup  panel centralcheck  panel nxstep  panel and others   we believe the udt cup we offer to customers differs from most other drug screening products on the market and may serve as a better alternative to many such products due to the fact that it can provide test results in a lesser amount of time one minute versus four to ten minutes for most competing products additionally the udt cup has an internal seal that may prevent cross contamination of the urine sample when shaken or jostled during testing this is a feature that most other competing drug screening kits do not have the udt cup’s design is also designed in a way that can make it more suitable for use among both males and females this however is our own opinion the udt cup also comes standard with a temperature strip included as part of the kit something most other drug screening kits offer but only as an “add on feature” for an additional cost   other business activities   on july   we ihealthcare inc organized ihealthcare surgical llc a florida limited liability company the members of

determining which internet media outlet will be preferable but we have plans to consider and perhaps implement marketing campaigns via social media networks such as facebook twitter etc online marketing platforms news related websites industry related websites etc we will also be listing our products on amazon in order to take advantage of the worldwide presence and reach of amazon in order to reach an even greater audience and sell our products to as many consumers as possible   in addition to our online presence we also are in the planning stages of a multimedia campaign which may include but may not strictly be limited to telemarketing print media making our presence known at trade shows and television advertisements the exact details of our multimedia plan are currently in the exploration and planning stages   our growth strategy is to spread awareness of our products via the internet and potentially other sources all cross the country beginning in the south east then moving north and eventually west when and if we have developed a market for our products within the united states we will then evaluate the possibility of expanding to other countries throughout the world    at this time we do not have not yet identified a definitive timeline as to the length of time it will take us to initialize or carry out the above growth strategy we are currently investigating the costs that we will incur in carrying out the above endeavors to begin generating sales from our current product   we believe we need to develop a more concrete marketing plan so that we can sell the goods on a large scale to more than one consumer from time to time we also believe we need to hire additional staff of which we have begun to do so to date we have hired what we refer to as an “svp of operations” this individual is responsible for formulating our marketing plan moving forward amending it as seen fit contacting and facilitating relationships with potential wholesalers and overseeing any other sales employees we currently have or may hire in the future currently we have two sales team members that are commission based at this point in time none of our

work alongside our svp of operations besides all of the above we have no other employees of any kind   our full time employees including our officers and directors currently devote and intend to continue to devote  hours per week towards the company in the future we intend to increase our sales staff however the number of employees we would hire would depend on our current level of revenue and cash available to do so we plan to hire these employees on a need be basis that is currently unidentified      table of contents   use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a
