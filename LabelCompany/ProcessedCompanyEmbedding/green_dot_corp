shut your account down if they think you use them  much and keep the moneytry getting it back is laughableyou cant even check the validity of the card bc you can no longer call customer service bc theres not anysince you can only load so much i had to get it on  separate cards to load to the prepaid card for my bills they decide that loading  refill cards seemed excessive and it was violation of terms it clearly was not bc the amount didnt exceed the limit they shut my account down refused to give a refund even with my receiptswell that was k gonei had to call green dot the prepaid card issuerand was told they had nothing to do with the refill cards put out by greendot corp its not the st time having issuesbut a refill card try to load it to be told its invalidwell with no way to

register online just to use the refill having  provide your birthday name  social security number  well thats all they need to steal more from you and thats after you already have to give all your info  the prepaid cardyou used to be able to load a moneypak on most prepaid cards but now only a select few so they are probably getting kickbacks from those companies that also charge outrageous fees per month  some charge both a monthly fee a per transaction fee and some even charge a fee if you call the automated system to hear your balancesmh they need to be permanently shut down  banned
