internationaljun  about service corporation sci integer investments longshort equity value special situations growth at reasonable priceinteger investmentssummaryservice corp international provides deathcare products and services in the united states and canadathe company’s q  results has demonstrated strong growth with sales growing by  compared to q here we discuss the robust qualitative factors that are driving service corp international’s growth before providing a valuation on the businessby hamish kumar integer investments analyst investment thesis service corp internationals sci recent earnings release emphasizes the companys stability and earnings power the company is trading at a fair valuation and we therefore recommend a hold recommendation what do they do service corporation international together with its subsidiaries is north americas largest provider of deathcare products and services in the region the company operates through both funeral and cemetery segments these segments comprise of providing funeral services and locations cemeteries funeral servicecemetery combination locations crematoria and related businesses the company also provides professional services and merchandise relating to funerals and cremations this includes but is not limited to motor vehicle services urns burial caskets and cremation memorialization products the industry is stable and extremely unlikely to be disrupted by external factors such as technology or the general economy recent performance service corp internationals q  earnings were reported on april th the company has had another strong quarter with revenue increasing  and operating income increasing  compared to prior year results this was driven by a combination of comparable cemetery revenue growth and acquisitionrelated growth acquisitionrelated effects allowed the business to increase revenue and at the same time decrease costs funeral service revenue also grew as funeral volumes were unusually weak the previous quarter a summary of the results is presented below competitive advantage service corp international has two competitive advantages  the sheer size of the company within the industry  in usa means that sci has the ability to considerably drive costs down through economies of scale as well as invest a lot more money on acquiring other deathcare providers or burial locations economies of scale is achieved through purchasing merchandise in bulk and reducing per  of revenue overhead costs sci is the only large provider of deathcare services with other competitors primarily being small and singlelocation providers  service corp international has the ability to provide a fullservice package merchandise funeral services and burialcremation for customers this means that the business can take care of all of the planning required for a funeral service to run smoothly this is particularly appealing to customers as it reduces both the stress and time involved in preparations although certain other competitors provide similar offerings competition is location based sci may therefore be the only provider of this offering in certain regions industry and business drivers  as stated in scis annual report although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries the majority of deathcare businesses in north america are locallyowned independent operations it is estimated that service corp internationals funeral and cemetery market share in north america is approximately  based on estimated total industry revenue the position of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name reputation and location of that funeral service location or cemetery although competitive pricing professional service and attention and wellmaintained locations are also important  specifically in regards to sci the business aims to offer highquality products and services at prices that are competitive with local competing funeral service locations cemeteries and retail locations funeral service locations and cemeteries operate under various names as most operations were acquired as existing businesses  the funeral and cemetery industry is well positioned for longterm profitable growth the large baby boomer population which in  are aged  to  are already impacting the industry today the aging demographic landscape is driving increased preneed cemetery and funeral sales for sci with the average preneed cemetery customer preneed deferred revenue on services and merchandise aged in their early sixties and average preneed funeral consumer in their early seventies we also expect a need revenue to increase with the mediumterm as the average consumer of this category being aged in their late seventiesearly eighties longterm growth strategies service corp international has generated stable returns over the last several years however is this purely driven by the industry in accordance with management the company has several key growth initiatives these initiatives are explained below  acquisitions the company remains acquisition focused within both the funeral and cemetery segments within the funeral segment acquisitions would provide the potential for scale in areas with the highest return customer categories and market traits within the cemetery segment acquisitions are primarily pursued to create more opportunities to sell to baby boomers through a customerdriven strategy with rising demand for cemeteries expected in the coming years due demographics making acquisitions now could prove to be lucrative for the business in the future  investment in generating sales over the past several years service corp international has heavily invested in the infrastructure and training of their sales organization the business completed its implementation of salesforcecom nysecrm during  the companys new customer relationship management system during  we expect sci to reap the benefits of this implementation delivering a stronger focus on customer appeal and satisfaction the business expects the system to enhance sales team efficiency lending to more effective staff in generating revenue  preneed trust due to the businesss  billion backlog of preneed sales sci has invested a large sum of this money in investment trusts sci maintains a low risk investment structure with relatively liquid assets in their portfolio the business also enjoys favorable terms with third party insurance providers independent operators cannot easily duplicate these arrangements with third parties this gives the business an edge in funding future growth and profitability over time  debt financing although not a specific strategy service corp international has funded much of its growth through debt over the last several years this is primarily due to the low interest rate environment resulting in cheaper costs for capital to implement business strategies in the near term future sci is expected to continue leveraging this opportunity but much cautiously this is due to the businesss now relatively highly leveraged capital structure sci has also stated that they may seek to make open market debt repurchases when it is opportunistic to do so relative to other capital deployment opportunities this in order to manage their nearterm debt maturity profile see below for a discussion of debt related risks risks despite a stable industry that service corp international operates in combined with the businesss steady growth we must be aware of the risks associated with the business perhaps the most pertinent risk for service corp international is their high debt levels as of march st  the companys longterm debttoequity ratio stood at  this is almost double the  longterm debt to equity ratio management posted in june  source ychartscom this higher debt level has caused the business to become considerably riskier with a larger fixed cost base and potential issues of inability to make debt principal repayments in the future these risks could significantly escalate if there is a downturn in its business operations or if the company continues to debt finance acquisitions on a large scale below is a table showing historical fcff for the firm over the last  years comparing this to the projected debt repayments in the future we see that the company may not generate enough cash in a given year to meet repayment requirements this also doesnt include the additional interest payment requirements below the fcff line estimated to be average approximately m pa for the next three years further the company is currently paying approximately m in dividends however when taking into account cash reserves and trust deed funds the company can be seen as having reasonable ability to make obligation requirements we also believe that sci currently has the financial capacity to refinance much of its debt partially due to its ability to low correlation to the macro economy this can be seen through its performance during the gfc where cash flows from operating activities only dropped by  source gurufocuscom another risk although less severe is the fact that service corp international is largely driven by external factors the industry itself and to a lesser extent the economy determines the revenue and profitability of sci with industry demand currently growing under the growing age of the baby boomer population what will happen in the future can growth be sustainable beyond the baby boomer generation valuation

implied value   implied undervaluation   we have done a simple multiples analysis to value sci we used an evebitda metric to value the business we used ev to strip out any capital structure differences we also used an ebitda metric to nullify any da differences between companies service corp international is slightly undervalued based on our multiples analysis the company is trading at a price  lower than comparable companies based on the evebitda comparable sci is also trading at a pe multiple  lower than its comparable companies is this justified however below is a chart demonstrating the performance of comparable companies over the last year ttm our analysis shows that sci has generated slightly less growth than its comparable companies the company is also more

ongoing as of late  michael avenatti the plaintiff’s attorney said more than  families have joined the class action suit avenatti claims the states investigation was shoddy saying “investigators from the state were told by various groundskeepers over a year ago that they had been repeatedly told to throw bones away and yet for some reason the state didn’t adequately follow up” sci denied all charges after the lawsuit was filed the consumer affairs department reviewed five to six years of the cemeterys annual inspection records and found no indication that graves had been disturbed according to the los angeles times article the agency also asked the dozens of families that contacted officials to look for signs of disturbances  shifted or cracked gravestones or anything else that appeared different from previous visits  and didn’t receive a single call back he said in january  the lawsuit against eden memorial park was ruled to be a valid class action in los angeles superior

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

plaintiff’s attorney said more than  families have joined the class action suit avenatti claims the states investigation was shoddy saying “investigators from the state were told by various groundskeepers over a year ago that they had been repeatedly told to throw bones away and yet for some reason the state didn’t adequately follow up” sci denied all charges after the lawsuit was filed the consumer affairs department reviewed five to six years of the cemeterys annual inspection records and found no indication that graves had been disturbed according to the los angeles times article

plaintiff’s attorney said more than  families have joined the class action suit avenatti claims the states investigation was shoddy saying “investigators from the state were told by various groundskeepers over a year ago that they had been repeatedly told to throw bones away and yet for some reason the state didn’t adequately follow up” sci denied all charges after the lawsuit was filed the consumer affairs department reviewed five to six years of the cemeterys annual inspection records and found no indication that graves had been disturbed according to the los angeles times article

corporation international sahana zutshi  october     service corporation international sci provides death care products and services in the united states germany and canada it is north america’s largest single provider of funeral and cremation services operations include cemeteries funeral homes combinations of funeral services and cemeteries crematoria and related services funeralrelated products such as caskets burial vaults cremation receptacles and memorial products are also sold the company was founded in  by robert l waltrip and is based in houston texas the original funeral services business incorporated efficiencies of scale and reduced costs by sharing resources and personnel among several funeral homes with the success of the strategy service corporation sought ownership of other businesses in the industry by  it had a north american network of nearly  funeral homes and cemeteries in  the company expanded into international markets and acquired major companies in australia the united kingdom and france as well as smaller businesses in south america at the end of  service corp’s network numbered more than  funeral service cemeteries and crematories in  countries after the aggressive expansion strategy purchase prices were inflated and corporate debt levels were elevated the company then decided to implement numerous initiatives to pay down debt reduced overhead and increase cash flow as a result it also divested a majority of its offshore businesses and many north american funeral homes and cemeteries that were underperforming in addition it introduced dignity memorial a brand of death care services and products most of the company’s businesses today feature the dignity memorial logotype on their signage along with the local heritage names under which some have operated for more than  years from  through  service corp reduced its net debt by more than  billion increased efficiency raised profitability and tightened internal controls it also resumed quarterly dividend payments in  then the company acquired its biggest competitor alderwoods group in november  the move resulted in the addition of  funeral homes and cemeteries as well as an expanded geographic network that enabled service corp to serve customers in  states eight canadian provinces the district of columbia and puerto rico more recently it acquired keystone north america a tampabased funeral services provider in march of this year this acquisition increased the company’s network and helped the company branch out of traditional funeral services keystone’s preneed backlog of deferred revenues has also increased service corporation’s longterm stability as well service corporation is one of the biggest players in the funeral services industry which is fairly fragmented as the top  companies generate only  of the markets total revenue the industry contains approximately  establishments many of them familyowned and revenues total about  billion annually it is a slow growth industry with much of the value coming from dividends issued by companies as a result in the s companies turned to consolidation as a way to bolster revenues and profits though acquisition activity was very prevalent at the time it has since slowed down as the recession hit company finances  as mentioned in the short history provided above service corporation divested a number of unprofitable enterprises in order to increase profits and efficiency during this time service corporation also introduced a new business model in which it started buying successful funeral homes and rather than branding them with the service corp logo the acquired businesses often retained their original names and management the company also introduced the “dignity” logo mentioned above which it required their subsidiaries to have on its funeral homes cemeteries paperwork vehicles etc this company is one of the biggest players in the funeral services industry today  it also has a number of crematories which will benefit the company in the future as people shift from traditional funeral arrangements to cheaper cremations finally the company has a solid business model and management will likely continue its aggressive acquisition strategy at the time of this article’s writing the author did not have any positions in the companies mentioned
