but one which actually use very similar techniques on the one hand i am an armourer focussing mainly on medieval and creating work for reenactors colllectors and museums using traditional materials and techniques on the other hand i use titanium to make very wearable contemporary jewellery some of which is inspired by the armour aesthetic and techniques further info open to the public no contact swordweaver armoury  northfield ave wigston leicester leicestershire le fx gb   miniature english armour made by julian adams the current project is a th scale tableau of richard iii an four of his retinue in their final charge at the battle of bosworth everythng has been produced from the ground up – horses clothing knight models leatherwork embroidery and armour many thanks to my wife jane and daughter kate for doing the work i couldn’t do the project is now nearing completion but will have taken eighteen months phaelera brooch made by julian adams a client saw the replica phaelera and asked if i could make this into a brooch for her the centre stone is carnelian horse phaelera made by julian adams jewry wal museum in licestr asked me to make a replica of a st century horse decoration called a phaelera it had been found in a dig in leicester in  but was in too fragile a condition to be exhibited i cast the bronze and hammered it the formed the piece and pierced the horse heads it was a complex and somewhat eperimental processthe replica is now used in their educational program miniature horse armour made by julian adams this was comissined as a birthday present it is approx half sized saddle steel detail made by julian adams a detail the spiral on the saddle steel saddle steels made by julian adams i don’t make saddles but on occasion i do make the steels for them this is a fairly complex example ‘little blue’ titanium collar made by julian adams the design for this was inspired by a ppiece of armour called a gorgette that protected the throat and upper chest the colours are produced by an anodizing process usig high voltage electricity to create an oxide layer on the surface of the titanium ‘little blue’ is in fact pink but is named after a n earlier and larger piece – big blue – made from blued steel the name kind of stuck blued steel bowl made by julian adams smetimes armour was heat blued for decorative effect or as an adjunct process to mercury gilding i use the same processes shaping hammering blueing to make bowls and vessels each one is unique and the process is enhaced to increase the range of colours and patterns involved horse armour detail made by julian adams a detail from the bosworth horse armour horse armour shaffron and crinnet made by julian adams this piece was comissioned for the leicestershire museums’ service and is in the batte room at bosworth battlefield the model for his was a massive and very gentle shire cross horse by the name of peter who tolerated the various measuring and fitting sessions with very good
