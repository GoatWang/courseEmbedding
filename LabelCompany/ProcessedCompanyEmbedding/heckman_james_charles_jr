v james c heckman jr appellant annotate this case download pdf in the court of appeals of the state of washington division ii in re the marriage of no ii tracey l heckman respondent and james c heckman unpublished opinion appellant houghton pj james heckman appeals from a trial court order relating to the dissolution of his marriage arguing that it improperly set a maintenance start date and incorrectly set child support we affirm in part reverse in part and remand facts tracey and james heckman married in  and separated in  they have three sons in may  tracey and james entered into four cr a agreements to resolve dissolutionrelated financial issues and to set a parenting plan the spousal maintenance and child   we refer to the parties by their first names for clarity intending no disrespect cr a states no agreement or consent between parties or attorneys in respect to the proceedings in a cause the purport of which is disputed will be regarded by the court unless the same shall have been made and assented to in open court on the record or entered in the minutes or unless the evidence thereof shall be in writing and subscribed by the attorneys denying the same no ii support agreement stated that james would pay tracey  per month in combined child support and spousal maintenance it allowed the trial court to allocate later what portion of the total payment would be child support the agreement also stated the spousal maintenance shall be paid for thirtysix  months from the date the decree of dissolution is entered clerk s papers cp at  james began paying the  per month in june  on april   the parties appeared in court to set the child support amount tracey asked the trial court to order child support above the standard calculation of  per month because of the income and the lifestyle of the parties in order to allow the children to maintain a lifestyle is commensurate with the parent s income resources and standards of living report of proceedings apr   rp at   see also rcw  tracey submitted a declaration noting that maintaining her children s current lifestyle requires more than  per month she argued that james made a minimum  in annual salary plus additional income and that her income was less than  per month tracey presented evidence of the parties upscale lifestyle she noted that before the separation  the family was building a waterfront home on bainbridge island  the family often rented ski houses by the season at whistler and later purchased a condominium there  the family often ate at expensive restaurants and traveled annually to hawaii  the children ski raced attended private school and wore expensive clothing and  james owned a lake house and waterski boat in port angeles  rcw  states in relevant part the legislature intends in establishing a child support schedule to insure that child support orders are adequate to meet a child s basic needs and to provide additional child support commensurate with the parents income resources and standard of living  no ii james countered that before the trial court may increase child support payments it must make specific findings of fact which are based upon facts in evidence rp at  further he argued that the trial court needed to examine the relative needs of the children    not the resources of the individual parties in setting child support rp at  he added that most of the wealth that he had was the result of postseparation actions and activities such as a new job with bonuses rp at  he stated that he pays equally for most of the children s expenses and activities he also questioned whether tracey s list of childrearing expenses accurately reflected spending on the children as opposed to her spending it on her own lifestyle finally he suggested setting a monthly payment of  per child as support at a hearing on the matter the trial court noted that it followed the reasoning in two cases in the matter of the marriage of mccausland  wnd   pd   and in the matter of the marriage of daubert  wn app   pd   it agreed with james that it could not simply extrapolate the standard child support amounts to account for his large income rather it had to look to the children s needs in setting the amount the trial court agreed with tracey that the family enjoyed a very high standard of living and it stated that it sought to minimize the income disparity and lifestyle differences as the children traveled between homes the trial court ordered  per child for a total of  per month in support payments the trial court then entered an order of child supporting this decision the trial court s  extrapolation means to mechanically extend the economic table for support applicable to lower incomes to set support payments for higher incomes not set out in the table mccausland  wnd at   no ii findings of fact stated   the parties have negotiated child support amounts and have reached agreements in the past  mr heckman has paid child support in excess of the transfer payment as a result of these agreements  the amount of income of the parties exceeds the presumptive and advisory amounts of the child support schedules mr heckman in tax year  has had an income of over  per month and currently earns the approximate amount of  per month the mother is working part time and has as a result of her voluntary underemployment income is imputed to her at the sum of  per month  the mother has relied upon the amounts of child support previously paid by the father and the children have been exposed to an expanded lifestyle by both parents  the parties and their children have had an extravagant lifestyle based upon the income of the father  the basic needs of the children are well met by the child support schedules which have been set up to say what the minimum needs are for children  the children of sic the beneficiaries of the father s expanded wealth and enjoyed activities such as the following a generous food allowances expensive food and often

children s transfers back and forth between the parents who have grossly    dissimilar incomes it would be detrimental to the overall relationship that the children have with one parent if that parent has at a significantly different standard of living than the other  that in establishing child support the court is taking into consideration the fact that the father is by agreement paying  of the private education of the  the trial court grouped its various findings as subsections under its finding of fact  for clarity we refer to those subsections as findings of fact  no ii children  the court is required to and has looked at the basic needs of the children the standard of living of the parties and the children the special medical educational and financial needs of the children the court s evaluation of the standard of living is separate and apart from the basic needs of the children the court is applying the standards as enunciated in mccausland v mccausland  wash app   pd   and daubertrusch cp at  on august   the parties appeared in court for a second time and discussed the start date for the child support payments the trial court set a june  child support payment start date the month after the parties signed the cr a agreements the parties also disputed the start date for the  months of spousal maintenance james asserted that like the child support payments the month period started in june  the month after the parties signed the cr a agreements setting a  total for support and maintenance tracey responded that the cr a agreement with respect to maintenance stated it would continue for  months from the date of the entry of the dissolution decree the trial court agreed with tracey james appeals analysis i spousal maintenance start date james first contends that the trial court erred when it started the child support payments in june  without doing the same for spousal maintenance he argues that tracey conceded that all payments should start in june  when she argued for the june  start date for child support payments to support his argument james relies on rhone v butcher  wn app   pd   review denied  wnd   which allows reformation of a written  no ii contract if the document does not reflect the parties intent and is based on a mutual mistake of fact he maintains that the later start date of the month period for maintenance payments results in a  month spousal maintenance windfall of what was by the terms of the cr a agreement to be a  month maintenance obligation appellant s reply br at  tracey responds that the cr a agreement the parties signed states that spousal maintenance shall be paid for  months from the date the decree of dissolution is entered cp at  the agreement did not contain any deadline or date for child support and thus she asserts that she did not take inconsistent positions or concede in any way that the written cr a agreement does not reflect her intent regarding the duration of maintenance payments we interpret a cr a agreement the same as any other written contract in the matter of the marriage of ferree  wn app    pd   we begin our contract interpretation by ascertaining the parties objective intent berg v hudesman  wnd    pd   in doing so we may not impose obligations that never before existed wagner v wagner  wnd    pd   the mutual mistake doctrine allows reformation of a contract when the parties shared an identical intent when they entered into the contract but the document does not accurately express that intent rhone  wn app at   where a purported agreement does not reflect a meeting of the minds the courts should resolve such disputes in the way most likely to enforce the parties expectations  the parties clearly intended for james to pay spousal maintenance for  months as calculated by subtracting the child support amount from the agreed  per month total tracey s position and the trial court s determination led to spousal maintenance in excess of the  no ii amount and duration the parties contemplated because the trial court directed james to pay  per month starting in june  we conclude that the  months of spousal maintenance began at that time thus we reverse and remand with instructions to order that spousal maintenance started on the same date as child support june  ii child support james next contends that the trial court erred in setting child support he raises a number of arguments that we address in turn we review child support orders for an abuse of discretion mccausland  wnd at  we do not substitute our judgment for the trial court s unless it bases its decision on untenable or unreasonable grounds in the matter of the marriage of leslie  wn app    pd   we review a trial court s findings of fact for substantial evidence that is evidence sufficient to persuade a rational person of the truth of the premise state ex rel jvg v van guilder  wn app    pd   a departure from standard support james first contends that the trial court improperly treated the departure from the standard support amount as a deviation under rcw  and thus it did not apply the correct standard to determining the amount of support payments he also asserts that the trial court entered only cursory findings of fact insufficient to support the excessive payments he maintains mccausland  wnd at   rejected that the deviation standard applied to situations in which a court increases support payments due to high income he adds that the trial  we address the evidence supporting the findings below but note that we do not agree that the findings are cursory so as to preclude review  no ii court s citation to the overruled the court of appeals mccausland opinion in its written findings of fact demonstrates the trial court did not follow the law former rcw   states that for child support predicated on incomes over  per month the court may exceed the advisory amount of support    upon written findings of fact the trial court entered findings of fact detailing the extravagant lifestyle enjoyed by the children cp at  the written order stated that the trial court set support in excess of the advisory amount based on the findings and in its findings the trial court set child support in excess of the standard calculation based on possession of wealth and the standard of living based upon the income of the father and the life style that they have enjoyed cp at  the supreme court s mccausland opinion rejected extrapolation as a means for calculating support in cases involving excessive incomes  wnd at  instead it directed trial courts to analyze the following factors  the parents standard of living and  the children s special medical educational or financial needs when entering its written findings of fact mccausland  wnd at  it added that these factors were not exclusive mccausland  wnd at   correct standard james focuses on the use of the term deviate in the written order as well as the trial court s citation to the overruled the court of appeals mccausland decision mccausland uses the terms deviation and extrapolation interchangeably  wnd at  in fact the petitioner in that case asked our supreme court to clarify the use of extrapolation in determining  no ii child support obligations mccausland  wnd at  the record does not support james s argument that the trial court misunderstood the process and did not follow the supreme court s mccausland opinion here although the written order uses the term deviates to explain a departure from the recommended support amounts a review of the april   hearing shows that the trial court and tracey agreed with james that the trial court could not simply extrapolate using his income to arrive at a support amount cp at  at argument below both parties and the trial court discussed the supreme court s mccausland opinion in depth moreover the trial court clearly understood that it needed to conduct a factfinding process using the factors set out in daubert in fact the written order cites daubert and rusch rusch v rusch  wn app   pd   the trial court followed the correct standard and james s argument fails  possession of wealth james next contends that because the trial court proceeded as if it were deviating from the maximum advisory level of support it impermissibly based its decision on the father s possession of wealth rcw avi tracey responds that that trial court properly considered the daubertrusch factors the parents standard of living and the children s needs mccausland prohibits using parental income as the basis for deviation or extrapolation rather it directs that the amount of child support must be based on the correlation to the child s or children s needs mccausland  wnd at  n this amount must be commensurate with the parents income resources and standard of living mccausland  wnd at   no ii orthodontia summer camp college test preparation classes computers and travel for extracurricular activities or cultural experiences are within the appropriate bases for additional support in the matter of the marriage of krieger  wn app    pd   the trial court s findings of fact detail the high standard of living that the children enjoyed the findings add that the court must try to create some balance between the children s transfers back and forth between the parents cp at  the trial court expressed these concerns at the hearing the detailed findings while they mention the father s income base the increased payments not on the income but on the lifestyle that income created and the corresponding increased children s needs commensurate with that lifestyle consequently the trial court did not abuse its discretion it issued findings of fact consistent with the daubert standard and james s argument fails b improper cost allocation james further contends that the trial court did not follow former rcw    former rcw  states in relevant part  the basic child support obligation derived from the economic table shall be allocated between the parents based on each parent s share of the combined monthly net income  ordinary health care expenses are included in the economic table monthly health care expenses that exceed five percent of the basic support obligation shall be considered extraordinary health care expenses extraordinary health care expenses shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation  day care and special child rearing expenses such as tuition and longdistance transportation costs to and from the parents for visitation purposes are not included in the economic table these expenses shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation  no ii he asserts that it included skiing and ski racing costs in the child support amount as opposed to requiring both parents to share the costs pro rata tracey counters that james offers no citation that supports his conclusion that going skiing was considered by the legislature in the same category as tuition to attend school resp t s br at  she adds that the daubert court considered items such as trips extracurricular activities and computers as appropriate bases for increased support payments and that skiing similarly falls under general child support guidelines as opposed to a type of activity the pro rata section of the statute covered tracey cannot rely on daubert in that case the trial court concluded that orthodontia is an appropriate basis for additional support under rcw  summer camp sat prep classes computers and travel for extracurricular activities or cultural experiences are within the appropriate bases for additional support under rcw  daubert  wn app at  citations omitted emphasis added thus daubert considered extracurricular expenses as ones shared pro rata under section three of the statute consequently following daubert the trial court should not have included the skiracingrelated expenses in the basic child support obligation rcw  nevertheless as explained below even without the skiing expenses the remaining six of the seven factors the trial court relied on support its child support order c challenges to factual support for various expenditures james further contends that substantial evidence does not support the trial court s findings of fact      and  he also questions whether any facts support the trial court s determination that tracey would provide any ski activities for the children buy highend  no ii clothing for the children take the children on vacations or eat out with them and he contends that the trial court did not follow daubert because it failed to require substantiation of tracey s future alleged childrearing expenses in findings of fact  and  the trial court found that the parties previously negotiated support payments in excess of the transfer payment in findings of fact  and  the trial court found that tracey relied on previouslypaid child support and that the children were exposed to an expanded lifestyle and extravagant lifestyle by both parents tied to the father s income cp at  in finding of fact  the trial court explained that it attempted to create some balance between the children s transfers back and forth between the parents who have grossly dissimilar incomes and that it would be detrimental to the overall relationship that the children have with one parent if that parent at sic a significantly different standard of living than the other cp at  in finding of fact  the trial court cited the overruled court of appeals decision in mccausland  wn app   clothing travel and meals james argues that the additional claimed expenses such as clothing and expensive meals lack any support in particular he asserts that tracey made no attempt to show these costs are the children s rather than hers tracey counters that she submitted a declaration stating that the costs of maintaining the children in an enhanced lifestyle would be approximately  per month she also submitted  because the trial court should not have included skiing related expenses as a basis for ordering support we do not address james s argument that tracey did not establish that she paid anything for the children s skiing activities  no ii a financial declaration detailing meal and clothing costs the financial declaration also contains a listing of her personal monthly expenses at the hearing below the parties disputed the amounts necessary to support the children and james questioned the amount of money tracey actually spent on the children tracey appeared at the hearing and presented a sworn statement the trial court heard argument on the children s standard of living and determined that  per month per child was the proper child support amount james contends that to make a proper award the trial court needed evidence to document the future necessity of increased expenditures he asserts that it had to segregate tracey s own expenditures james cannot rely on daubert for the proposition that future expenses must be documented in this case here tracey provided financial statements and declarations to support an ongoing need to maintain an enhanced lifestyle for her children whereas the questioned activities in daubert high school band travel or onetime or limited term expenses had a natural end point and the parties did not submit documentation to show that the expenses would continue through the support period  wn app at   although james questioned how tracey spent the child support she presented multiple financial documentsdeclarations detailing the children s needs the trial court properly weighed both arguments and examined the documents in determining the amount of support it did not abuse its discretion in setting the child support amount further the trial court s written findings of fact demonstrate that it focused on the children s needs not tracey s in setting the support  no ii amount krieger  wn app at  again james s argument fails  previous agreements james challenges takes issue with the trial court s finding of fact that the parties had previously negotiated child support amounts in excess of the standard transfer payment before the trial court he argued that the parties had previously negotiated a single undifferentiated child support and maintenance payment of  per month at a previous hearing tracey told the trial court that the  payment consisted of  per month in support and  per month in maintenance a temporary child support order confirms that james paid  per month in child support as a compromise amount cp at  the record supports the trial court s findings of fact  and   reliance on support and creation of an enhanced lifestyle james argues that tracey presented no evidence that she continued to expose the children to attributes of what the trial court called an enhanced lifestyle in the postseparation period he asserts that she failed to show that the children expect her to perpetuate any of the aspects of that lifestyle when they are with her appellant s br at  tracey responds that aside from a minimal amount of imputed income she relied entirely on the previously negotiated  per month payment and the cr a  payment to provide for herself and the children she submitted declarations detailing her and her children s lifestyle pre and postseparation tracey s declarations support the trial court s findings that the children had and continued  no ii to enjoy an enhanced lifestyle and they should be able to continue in this fashion with both parents substantial evidence supports the trial court s findings of fact  and   balance in the children s transfers between households james next contends that the trial court improperly proceeded on the assumption that it had the right to examine the disparity that exists when children travel between the homes and how they make that adjustment appellant s br at  he argues that the mccausland court did not set forth this factor appellant s br at  the mccausland opinion does not limit the trial court to only the analysis to those factors it enunciated the mccausland opinion expressly states that the daubert factors it cites are nonexclusive mccausland  wnd at  further rcw  directs the trial court to examine the parents standard of living when setting child support payments consistent with this a trial court must try to maintain the children s standard of living at a level commensurate with that of both parents and the children s standard of living should not reflect that of the lowerearning parent and thus be lower than it would be if the parents were still married krieger  wn app at  these considerations demonstrate that substantial evidence supports the trial court s finding of fact  the trial court did not abuse its discretion and properly awarded child support to maintain a consistent lifestyle as the children moved between these two households  misapplication of the law james finally argues that the trial court applied the overruled court of appeals decision in mccausland  wn app  by referring to it in finding of fact  as we previously  no ii discussed although the trial court s order cites the overruled case the discussion at the april   support hearing clearly demonstrates that both parties and the trial court understood that the later supreme court case applies mccausland  wnd  and consistent with our supreme court s mccausland opinion the trial court clearly understood that it needed to conduct a fact finding process using the factors set out in daubert in fact the written order cites daubert and rusch the trial court applied the correct standard iii attorney fees tracey requests attorney fees under rcw  and rap  rcw  allows fees on appeal based on the parties relative ability to pay and the merit of the issues raised on appeal in the matter of the marriage of muhammad  wnd    pd   tracey submitted a financial declaration indicating both her need and james s ability to pay and her counter arguments for the most part have merit accordingly we award tracey her reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded a majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the washington appellate reports but will be filed for public record pursuant to rcw  it is so ordered  houghton pj  at argument before us tracey s counsel described it as essentially a scrivener s error  tracey s brief cites rcw  but this statute applies to fees in contempt proceedings and does not apply here we assume she means rcw   no ii we concur  bridgewater j  van deren cj  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news
