states more  a schulman inc roederer fairlawn ohio — materials maker a schulman inc is seeking growth via new products and a new sales approach the new products include plastic composites which did especially well for the fairlawnbased company in the first half of its current fiscal year global sales of engineered composites grew  percent in that sixmonth period schulman makes its composites at  global production sites the firm is adding capacity in hamburg germany and in june will open a composites innovation center at its production site in bay city mich executive frank roederer said in a recent interview in fairlawn were seeing growth in both smc sheet molded compound and bmc bulk molded compound materials said roederer who serves as senior vice president and general manager of engineered composites theres a lot going on in automotive and in traditional plastics applications like electricalelectronic agriculture heavy machinery and sports and leisure in aerospace applications schulmans composites can offer weight reduction and corrosion resistance as a metal replacement the materials dielectric properties also make them a good fit for electrical applications such as circuit breaker housings roederer explained the innovation center in bay city will include new machinery and equipment and will allow schulman to take advantage of having an engineering staff for its composites close to detroit the hub of the us auto industry customers are interested in new products now roederer said new vehicle platforms for  will have semistructural parts theres a rich pipeline focused on what we want to do the auto market is almost obsessed with reducing weight the new sales approach comes soon after the hiring of gary phillips as schulmans firstever chief commercial officer most of phillips career experience is in the telecommunications field this is a new position so its a challenge and ive been learning as fast as i can phillips said in fairlawn ive been looking at the overall process of how we sell and what our customer experience has been like this is an incredibly complex market the challenge becomes how to teach sales to do things differently he added weve said that this year is a reset year which gives us an opportunity to get closer to our customers the reset year described by schulman officials for fiscal  is the result of the company working to overcome financial shortfalls caused by its  million purchase of citadel plastics schulman is seeking damages from citadels former owners over faulty product data as part of this new approach schulman has consolidated seven business units into two product families the number of acquisitions that we had made had a cultural effect phillips explained we could have five sales reps at one customer now weve got one rep without losing depth at the technical level some customers have come back to us and said that were now simpler to deal with because theres less complexity he added elsewhere in new schulman materials roederer said that the firms polybatchbrand easypour additive concentrates could benefit from large amounts of new polyethylene resin capacity that are being added in north america the materials are designed to improve liquid dispensing from standup pouches and similar packaging formats thats a heavy polyethylene polypropylene type market he added schulman also recently partnered with three natural gas businesses to develop and produce a lowpressure natural gas storage tank for motor vehicles a finished prototype likely is another two years away roederer said but he added the concept is a gamechanging technology in stryker ohio schulman has worked to make its distribution network more efficient by repurposing a former materials production site as a distribution center the site includes a rail siding and allows schulman to do bulk to box to bag loading roederer said schulman posted sales of  billion in its  fiscal year the firm ranks as a leading
