instruments determination of fair value the partnerships fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires the partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets level  and the lowest priority to unobservable data level  in some cases the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as level   quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability including i quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets ii quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets iii inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and iv inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means includes the partnerships fixedprice swaps and basis swaps level   unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability includes the partnerships natural gas collars derivative financial instruments the managing general partner measures the fair value of the partnerships derivative instruments based on a pricing model that utilizes marketbased inputs including but not limited to the contractual price of the underlying position current market prices natural gas and crude oil forward curves discount rates such as the libor curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position volatility factors and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the managing general partners credit standing on the fair value of derivative liabilities and the effect of the managing general partners counterparties credit standings on the fair value of derivative assets both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding derivative position the managing general partner validates its fair value measurement through  the review of counterparty statements and other supporting documentation  the determination that the source of the inputs are valid  the corroboration of the original source of inputs through access to multiple quotes if available or other information and  monitoring changes in valuation methods and assumptions while the managing general partner uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques changes in the managing general partners pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values while the managing general partner believes its valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants the use of a different methodology or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value the managing general partner has evaluated the credit risk of the counterparties holding the derivative assets which are primarily financial institutions who are also major lenders in the managing general partners corporate credit facility agreement giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding derivative position based on the managing general partners evaluation the managing general partner has determined that the impact of the risk of nonperformance of the managing general partners counterparties on the fair value of the partnerships derivative instruments is insignificant      rockies region  limited partnership notes to unaudited condensed financial statements march   unaudited the following table presents for each

various public limited partnerships including this partnership will occur    index rockies region  limited partnership a west virginia limited partnership additional development plan the managing general partner has begun executing its plan for the partnerships wattenberg field wells which may provide for additional reserve development of natural gas ngls and crude oil production the “additional development plan” the additional development plan consists of the partnerships refracturing of wells currently producing in the codell formation andor recompletion in the niobrara or codell formation which is currently not producing refracturing activities consist of a second hydraulic fracturing treatment in a current production zone while recompletion activities consist of an initial hydraulic fracturing treatment in a new production zone all within an existing well bore historically refracturing and recompletion activities have resulted in an increase in both liquids and natural gas production additional development of wattenberg field wells which may provide for additional reserve development and production generally occurs five to ten years after initial well drilling so that well resources are optimally utilized this additional development would be expected to occur based on a favorable general economic environment and commodity price structure the managing general partner has the authority to determine whether to refracture or recomplete the individual wells and to determine the timing of any additional development activity the timing of the refracturing or recompletion can be affected by the desire to optimize the economic return by additional development of the wells when commodity prices are at levels that are believed to provide the highest rate of return to the partnership on average the production resulting from pdcs refracturings or recompletions have increased production however not all refracturings or recompletions have been economically successful and similar future refracturing or recompletion activities may not be economically successful if the additional development work is performed the partnership will bear the direct costs of refracturing or recompletion and the investor partners and the managing general partner will each pay their proportionate share of costs based on the ownership sharing ratios of the partnership from funds retained by the managing general partner from cash available for distributions the managing general partner considers the cash available for distributions to be the partnerships net cash flows provided by operating activities less any net cash used in capital activities the limited partnership agreement the “agreement” permits the partnership to borrow funds or receive advances from the managing general partner its affiliates or unaffiliated persons for partnership activities at this time the managing general partner does not anticipate electing to fund the initial additional development plans well refracturings or recompletions nor any subsequent refracturings or recompletions through bank borrowing in the event that the partnerships refracturing or recompletion activities are funded in part through borrowing potential cash available for distributions derived from production increases provided by this additional development of the partnerships wattenberg field wells may not be sufficient to repay the partnerships borrowing financial obligations which will include principal and interest borrowings if any will be nonrecourse to the investor partners accordingly the partnership not the investor partners will be responsible for loan repayment however any bank borrowings may be collateralized by the partnerships assets and may restrict distributions as long as there is a balance due on any loan during the fourth quarter of  the managing general partner began a program for its affiliated partnerships to begin accumulating cash from cash flows from operating activities to pay for future refracturing or recompletion costs this program will materially reduce up to  cash available for distributions of the partnerships for a period of time not to exceed five years current estimated costs for these well refracturings or recompletions are between  and  per activity as of march    this partnership had scheduled to complete  additional development opportunities total withholding for these activities from the partnerships cash available for distributions is estimated to be between  million and  million if all the activities are performed the managing general partner will continually evaluate the timing of the additional development activities based on engineering data and a favorable commodity price environment in order to maximize the expected financial benefit of the additional well development during the three months ended march    of the  fund previously withheld from the partnerships cash distributions pursuant to the additional development plan were used to reimburse the managing general partner for the cost of initiating both recompletions and refracturings on two of the partnerships wells both the number and timing of the additional development activities will be based on the availability of cash withheld from partnership distributions the managing general partner believes that based on projected refracturing and recompletion costs and projected cash withholding all scheduled partnership additional development activity will be completed within a five year period any funds not used for refracturing recompletion or other operational needs will be distributed to the managing general partner and investor partners based on their proportional ownership interest      index rockies region  limited partnership a west virginia limited partnership implementation of the additional development plan has and will continue to reduce or eliminate partnership distributions to the managing general partner and investor partners while the work is being conducted and paid for through the partnerships funds depending upon the level of withholding and the results of operations it is possible that the managing general partner and investor partners could have taxable income from the partnership without any corresponding distributions in future years nonaffiliated investor partners are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine all of the relevant federal state and local tax consequences of the additional development plan the above discussion is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning and nonaffiliated investor partners should depend upon the advice of their own tax advisors concerning the effects of the additional development plan current low natural gas price environment the natural gas market continues to be characterized by depressed prices while the partnership has derivative instruments in place for a majority of its expected natural gas production sustained low natural gas prices would result in higher realized derivative gains upon settlement but also could have a material adverse effect as a result of lower natural gas sales a reduction in the estimated quantity of proved reserves and the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated from these reserves potential for future asset impairments a further decrease in forward natural gas prices during  could also result in significant impairment charges the partnerships piceance basin properties have significant natural gas reserves representing  of the total proved natural gas reserves and  of the partnerships total proved reserves at december   and are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices these assets which had a net book value of approximately  million at march   are at risk of impairment if future natural gas prices for the partnerships piceance production experience further longterm decline the cash flow model the partnership uses to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions such as the managing general partners estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices market outlook on forward commodity prices operating and development costs all inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date that the estimate of future cash flows for each producing basin is calculated however a significant decrease in longterm forward natural gas prices alone could result in a significant impairment of the partnerships properties that are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices   partnership

depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas ngls and crude oil and the managing general partners ability to market the partnerships production effectively natural gas ngls and crude oil prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices these price variations have a material impact on the partnerships financial results and capital expenditures the partnership has experienced a decline in the price of ngls mainly at conway hub in kansas where the partnerships wattenberg production is priced primarily due to increased ethane volumes and the limited market for ethane natural gas and ngl prices vary by region and locality depending upon the distance to markets the availability of pipeline capacity and the supply and demand relationships in that region or locality the combination of increased drilling activity and the lack of local markets has resulted in local market oversupply situations from time to time like most producers the partnership relies on major interstate pipeline companies to construct these pipelines to increase capacity rendering the timing and availability of these facilities beyond the partnerships control crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market supply and demand the financial markets and national and international politics the price the partnership receives for its natural gas produced in the rocky mountain region is based on a market basket of prices which generally includes natural gas sold at near or below cig prices as well as other nearby region prices the cig index and other indices for production delivered to other rocky mountain pipelines has historically been less than the price received for natural gas produced in the eastern regions which is primarily new york mercantile

primarily used to fund the partnerships operating costs general and administrative activities and provided monthly distributions to the investor partners and pdc the managing general partner during

additional information see item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developmentsadditional development plan  fluctuations in the partnerships operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices in production volumes and in realized gains and losses from commodity positions commodity prices have historically been volatile and the managing general partner attempts to manage this volatility through derivatives therefore the primary source of the partnerships cash flow from operations becomes the net activity between the partnerships natural gas ngls and crude oil sales and realized natural gas and crude oil derivative gains and losses however the partnership does not engage in speculative positions nor does the partnership hold derivative instruments for  of the partnerships expected future production from producing wells and therefore may still experience significant fluctuations in cash flows from operations as of march   the partnership had natural gas derivative positions in place covering all of the expected natural gas production for the remainder of  at an average price of  per mcf however the partnership has no ngl or crude oil derivatives see results of operations for further discussion of the impact of prices and volumes on sales from operations and the impact of derivative activities on the partnerships revenues the partnerships future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and revenues generated from natural gas ngls and crude oil production activities and commodity derivatives natural gas ngls and crude oil production from the partnerships existing properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the remaining life of the wells therefore the partnership anticipates a lower annual level of natural gas ngls and crude oil production and in the absence of significant price increases or additional reserve development lower revenues the partnership also expects cash flows from operations to decline if commodity prices remain at current levels or decrease in the future under these circumstances decreased production would have a material negative impact on the partnerships operations and may result in reduced cash distributions to the managing general partner and investor partners through the remainder of  and beyond and may substantially reduce or restrict the partnerships ability to participate in the additional development activities which are more fully described in item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments−additional development plan     index rockies region  limited partnership a west

nonrecourse to the investor partners accordingly the partnership not the investor partners will be responsible for repaying the loan working capital the partnership had working capital of  million at march    compared to working capital of  million at december   an increase of  million the increase was primarily due to the following changes • cash and cash equivalents decreased by  million between

december   • due to managing general partnerother net excluding natural gas ngls and crude oil sales received from third parties and realized derivative gains increased by  million between march    and december   working capital is expected to increase due to the partnership’s anticipated withholding of cash from the managing general partner and investor partners on a prorata basis for the initial refracturing activities the balance of the withholdings which began in the fourth quarter of  is  as of march   cash decreased as the funds were utilized in payment of development activities during  funding for the additional development plan will be provided by the withholding of distributable cash flows from the managing general partner and investor partners on a percentage of

payments are made for refracturing or recompletion activities cash flows cash flows from operating activities the partnerships cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices production volumes realized gains and losses from its derivative positions operating costs and general and administrative expenses see results of operations above for an additional discussion of the key drivers of cash flows provided by operating activities the price the partnership receives on its natural gas sales is impacted by the managing general partners transportation gathering and processing agreements the partnership currently uses the netback method of accounting for these arrangements related to the partnerships natural gas sales the partnership sells natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price since transportation costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price the netback method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the three months ended march    compared to  million for the comparable period in   the decrease of  million in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the following • a decrease in natural gas ngls and crude oil sales receipts of  million or  and • a decrease in production costs and direct costs  general and administrative payments of  million cash flows from investing activities the partnership from timetotime invests in equipment which supports treatment delivery and measurement of natural gas ngls and crude oil or environmental protection these amounts totaled

the partnership is revising the original form k to include in this amendment item atb management’s report on internal control over financial reporting which includes the managing general partner’s statement that the partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december   additionally related disclosures that identify the framework used by the managing general partner to so evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership’s internal controls have been included in this amendment  this report was inadvertently omitted from the original form k      the partnership is

form k  the original report did not include the average price used in the annual reserves calculation and included a statement limiting the use of the report to rockies region  limited partnership  the report of ryder scott included as the amendment’s exhibit  now includes the average price used in the annual reserve calculation and does not contain any language limitation on the use of the report      new certifications on behalf of the partnership by the managing general partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are being filed as exhibits to this amendment no  on form ka under part iv item  exhibits    there are no other changes to the original form k other than those outlined above this amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the original form k nor does it modify or update disclosures therein in any way other than as required to reflect the amendment set forth in the following index and report sections included in this amendment              item at    controls and procedures   the partnership has no direct management or officers  the management officers and other employees that provide services on behalf of the partnership are employed by the managing general partner    material weakness   as discussed in the management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in the partnership’s  annual report on form k the partnership did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as of december   over transactions that are directly related to and processed by the partnership in that the partnership failed to maintain sufficient documentation to adequately assess the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  more specifically the partnership’s financial close and reporting narrative failed to adequately describe the process identify key controls and assess segregation of duties  this material weakness has been remediated as of december     a   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of december   pdc as managing general partner on behalf of the partnership carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the managing general partners management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the partnerships disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules ae and de  this evaluation considered the various processes carried out under the direction of the managing general partner’s disclosure committee in an effort to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the partnership in the sec reports the partnership files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the partnership’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   based upon the evaluation the managing general partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december     b   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   management of pdc the managing general partner of the partnership is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting is defined in exchange act rules af and df as a process designed by or under the supervision of the issuer’s principal executive and principal

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that      pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer and      provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the issuer’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of the issuer              because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate   management of the managing general partner has assessed the effectiveness of the partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of december   based upon the criteria established in “internal control  integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  based on this evaluation management of the managing general partner concluded that the partnership maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december     this  annual report on form k does not include an attestation report of the partnership’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant to item ta of regulation sk     c   remediation of material weakness in internal control   pdc the managing general partner with participation from the audit committee of its board of directors addressed the material weakness disclosed in the partnership’s  annual report on form k  the managing general partner believes that the effective implementation of changes in internal controls over financial reporting outlined below remediated this known material weakness as of december     the partnership made the following changes in its internal control over financial reporting of the partnership as defined in rules af and df of the securities exchange act of  during      ● in the second quarter the partnership developed and implemented a plan to improve controls over certain key financial statement spreadsheets that support all significant balance sheet and income statement accounts  the partnership also created and documented a procedural framework to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the partnership’s derivative activities  additionally the partnership has completed the development of a revised financial close and reporting narrative that adequately describes the process identifies key controls and assesses segregation of duties     ● in the third quarter the partnership developed documentation that describes the business processes and identifies key controls for internal control over financial reporting that assisted the managing general partner in adequately assessing internal control over financial reporting for the partnership  in addition the partnership developed documentation and procedures to adequately assess segregation of duties  the controls and procedures were tested prior to december    at present the partnership has not quantified the total cost of this initiative however the majority of this cost is expected to be paid by the managing general partner              d   other changes in internal control over financial reporting   during  pdc made the following changes in pdc’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df of the securities exchange act of  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the partnership’s internal control over financial reporting     ● effective july   as part of pdc’s broader financial reporting system pdc implemented a new partnership investor distribution accounting module replacing the existing accounting software  pdc has taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls during this period of change  these steps included procedures to preserve the integrity of the data converted and a review by the business owners to validate data converted  additionally pdc provided training related to the business process changes and the financial reporting system software to individuals using the financial reporting system to carry out their job responsibilities as well as those who rely on the financial information  pdc anticipates that the implementation of this module will strengthen the overall systems of internal controls due to enhanced automation and integration of related processes  pdc is modifying the design and documentation of internal control process and procedures relating to the new module to supplement and complement existing internal control over financial reporting  the system changes were undertaken to integrate systems and consolidate information and were not undertaken in response to any actual or perceived deficiencies in pdc’s internal control over financial reporting  testing of the controls related to these new systems was included in the scope of pdc’s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of december     the managing general partner continues to evaluate the ongoing effectiveness and sustainability of the changes pdc made in internal control over financial reporting and as a result of the ongoing evaluation may identify additional changes to improve internal control over financial reporting  further information regarding the material weakness of the

region  limited partnership this “partnership” or the “registrant” was organized in  as a limited partnership in accordance with the laws of the state of west virginia for the purpose of engaging in the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties business operations commenced upon closing of an offering for the private placement of partnership units upon funding this

general partner ownership in this partnership according to the terms of the agreement revenues costs and cash distributions of this partnership are allocated  to the investor partners which are shared pro rata based upon the number of units in this partnership and  to the managing general partner the managing general partner may repurchase investor partner units under certain circumstances provided

average price of  per unit as of september    the managing general partner owned  of this partnership including the repurchased interest the managing general partner made no limited partner unit repurchases during the three months ended september      in the managing general partners opinion the accompanying condensed financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of this partnerships results for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx of the sec accordingly pursuant to such rules and regulations certain notes and other financial information included in the audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted the december   condensed balance sheet data was derived from financial statements audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp independent registered public accounting firm as indicated in their report filed with the sec on march   but does not include disclosures required by us gaap the information presented in this quarterly report on form q should be read in conjunction with this partnerships audited financial statements and notes thereto included in this partnerships  form k this partnerships accounting policies are described in the notes to financial statements in this partnerships  form k and updated as necessary in this quarterly report on form q the results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period   note   going concern   this partnership has historically funded its operations with cash flows from operations this partnership’s most significant cash outlays have related to its operating expenses capital program and distributions to partners this partnerships revenue is primarily influenced by crude oil sales the commodity price for crude oil generally remained strong from this partnerships inception into the fourth quarter of  however crude oil prices decreased significantly during  and continued to be depressed during the first six months of  with some improvement during the three months ended september    although this partnerships production increased  during the nine months ended september   as compared to the comparable prior year period as a result of the lower commodity prices this partnership generated modest revenue of  during the nine months ended september    further there was no improvement in this partnerships liquidity during the nine months ended september   as cash flows generated from crude oil natural gas and ngls sales were utilized for operating activities and capital expenditures   this partnerships strained liquidity position resulting from declining commodity prices raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to the significant decrease in liquidity experienced in  that has continued into  and anticipated future capital expenditures required to remain in compliance with certain regulatory requirements and to satisfy asset retirement obligations the managing general partner believes that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet this partnership’s obligations the price of crude oil during the three months ended september   has shown improvement over pricing experienced during the first half of  this level of price improvement alone is not likely to be sufficient to alleviate c              rockies region  limited partnership notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september   unaudited   oncerns regarding this partnership’s ability to meet its obligations one of this partnerships most significant obligations is to the managing general partner a portion of which is currently past due for reimbursement of costs paid on behalf of this partnership by the managing general partner such amounts are generally paid to third parties for general and administrative expenses and equipment and operating costs as well as monthly operating fees payable to the managing general partner beginning in the second quarter of  and continuing during the nine months ended september    this partnership made no quarterly cash distributions to the managing general partner or investor partners   the ability of this partnership to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to attain a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to fund current and future obligations and to allow for distributions to limited partners greater cash flow would most likely occur from improved commodity pricing and to a lesser extent a sustained increase in production however historically as a result of the normal production decline in a wells production life cycle this partnership has not experienced a sustained increase in production without capital expenditures   the managing general partner is considering various options to mitigate risks that raise substantial doubt about this partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern including but not limited to deferral of payment of certain obligations the majority of which are due to the managing general partner continued suspension of distributions to partners partial or complete sale of assets and the shuttingin of wells however there can be no assurance that this partnership will be able to mitigate such conditions failure to do so could result in a partial asset sale or some form of bankruptcy liquidation or dissolution of this partnership   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if this partnership is unable to continue as a going concern   note   summary of significant accounting policies   recently issued accounting standards   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that provides a single comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the standard outlines a fivestep approach to apply the underlying principle  identify the contract with the customer  identify the separate performance obligations in the contract  determine the transaction price  allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and  recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in march  the fasb issued an update to the standard intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations when recognizing revenue the revenue standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period the revenue standard can be adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition method entities are permitted to adopt the revenue standard early beginning with annual reporting periods after december   the managing general partner of this partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on this partnerships financial statements   in august  the fasb issued a new standard related to the disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern the new standard will explicitly require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances the new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after december   with early adoption permitted this partnership expects to adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on this partnerships financial statements   in august  the fasb issued an accounting update on statements of cash flows to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows the update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the managing              rockies region  limited partnership notes to unaudited condensed financial

managing general partner or investor partners as cash flows generated from crude oil natural gas and ngls sales were utilized for operating activities and capital expenditures cash distributions during the nine months ended september   include  related to cash distributions for investor partner units repurchased by pdc   note   fair value measurements   this partnerships fair value measurements were estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires this partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets level  and the lowest priority to unobservable data level  in some cases the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy in these cases the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment considering factors specific              rockies region  limited partnership notes to unaudited condensed financial statements september   unaudited   to the asset or liability and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels the carrying value of the financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments   the managing general partner utilizes fair value on a nonrecurring basis to perform impairment testing on this partnerships crude oil and natural gas properties by comparing net capitalized costs or carrying value to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows if net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value and is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed their estimated fair value   note   commitments and contingencies   legal proceedings   neither this partnership nor pdc in its capacity as the managing general partner of this partnership are party to any pending legal proceeding that pdc believes would have a materially adverse effect on this partnerships business financial condition results of operations or liquidity   environmental   due to the nature of the oil and gas industry this partnership is exposed to environmental risks the managing general partner has various policies and procedures in place to prevent environmental contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental contamination the managing general partner conducts periodic reviews to identify changes in this partnerships environmental risk profile liabilities are accrued when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated these liabilities are reduced as remediation efforts are completed or are adjusted as a consequence of subsequent periodic reviews   during the nine months ended september   and   as a result of the managing general partners periodic review no new environmental remediation projects were identified and this partnerships expense for environmental remediation efforts was not significant this partnership had no liabilities for environmental remediation efforts as of september   or december      the managing general partner is not currently aware of any environmental claims existing as of september   which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on this partnerships condensed financial statements however there can be no assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change or that unknown past noncompliance with environmental laws or other potential sources of liability will not be discovered on this partnerships properties   in august  the managing general partner received a clean air act section  information request the information request from the united states environmental protection agency epa the information request sought among other things information related to the design operation and maintenance of certain production facilities in the denverjulesburg basin of colorado the information request focused on historical operation and design information for  production facilities of which one relates to this partnership and asked that the managing general partner conduct sampling and analyses at the identified  facilities the managing general partner responded to the information request in january  the managing general partner continues to meet with the epa and provide additional information but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time   in addition in december  the managing general partner received a compliance advisory pursuant to crs §  from the colorado department of public health and environments air quality control commissions air pollution control division alleging that the managing general partner had failed to design operate and maintain certain condensate collection storage processing and handling operations to minimize leakage of volatile organic compounds to the maximum extent possible at  facilities consistent with applicable standards under colorado law certain of this partnerships wells were included in this list of  facilities the managing general partner is working with the agency to address the allegations but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time                rockies region  limited partnership notes to
