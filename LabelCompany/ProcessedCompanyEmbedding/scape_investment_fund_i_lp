combination of doubleline and robert shiller in one investment strategy marks an innovative new opportunity for investors one based on discipline and value mr gundlach said with its implementation of dr shillers longterm value strategy the fund complements the growth stock strategies launched by the doubleline equity team earlier this year i am very pleased with todays launch dr shiller said the fund allows investors to access the shiller barclays cape® us sector index in mutual fund format with doubleline combining two complementary valueorientated approaches across both equity and fixed income markets the fund seeks to deliver a total return in excess of the shiller barclays cape® us sector tr usd index the index doubleline will seek to invest  of the funds net assets in a debt instruments part of those holdings will be pledged as collateral against derivatives exposing the fund to the four most undervalued sectors in the us stock market as measured by the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio the cape® ratio thus through leverage the fund seeks to have simultaneous exposures both to the index and to debt securities each in an amount potentially up to the value of the funds net assets the index and the cape® ratio incorporate principles of longterm stock investing distilled by dr shiller to the extent the derivatives strategy leaves a substantial portion of the funds assets available for other investment doubleline will seek to manage the unreserved debt instruments to generate a supplemental source of longterm return the funds holdings of debt instruments may be similar to those of the doubleline core fixed income fund although the two portfolios are likely to differ in a number of respects such as for example the amount of holdings in cash or shortterm investments doubleline may determine to invest a portion of fund assets directly in the doubleline core fixed income fund in lieu of investing directly in a portfolio of debt instruments
