ranging lidar is an optical measurement principle to localize and measure the distance of objects in space basically it is similar to a radarsystem but instead of using microwaves lidar uses ultraviolett infrared or beams within the visible light spectrum besides distance measurements which is the basic task lidar sensors can be used for a limited visual detection of objects by analyzing the light intensity visibility measurement by analyzing the shape of the reflected lidar pulse daynight detection as background illumination is significantly different between day and night pollution detection and speed estimation as several research vehicles for autonomous driving vehicles like eg google car use lidar as basis sensor technology for scanning the environment there is an increase in development activities for lidar sensors meeting automotive requirements cost performance reliability parking assistance are systems which support the driver during parking manoeuver this is achieved either by providing distance information to relevant obstacles camera images or additionally by steering assistance for the different system configurations requirements regarding sensors signal processing hmi interfaces to the vehicle network need to be met while first parking systems only provided informations to the driver recent systems provide lateral steering support and current plus next gerneration parking systems will take more and more both lateral and longitudinal controll of the vehicle during the parking manoeuver in the near future valet parking systems will be available where the system searches for a suitable parking slot and performs the entire parking process automatically page p close plain text look inside reference work entry metrics provided by bookmetrix
