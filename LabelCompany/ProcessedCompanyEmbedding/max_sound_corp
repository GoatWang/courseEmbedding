blaisure explains his product as an “audio technology that restores all audio to highdefinition audio the way it works is it is a software that sees all the audio data that has been compressed and then restores it real time that exposes all that data so that when any other application sees it it’s seen as almost studioquality audio data which most people have never heard before” while other companies such as dolby “create a surround sound feel if our process is installed in front of dolby we just make dolby sound better” when asked to pick the best application for his software blaisure concludes by choosing their licensing agreement with qualcomm which is based “on licensed technology that resides on the chip that goes out over  billion phones in the next  months with full adoption by qualcomm now everyone gets hd audio across all devices and then we would move into other audios as in cars televisions and streaming” for more information about max sound corporation check out

corp files two lawsuits against google accusing search giant of misappropriating proprietary digital video streaming technology trade secret and patent infringement suits allege google misappropriated tech companys patented methods for streaming video compression used in android youtube chrome and other platforms case filed by law firms grant  eisenhofer buether joe  carpenter and walkup melodia kelly  schoenberger aug    et from grant  eisenhofer wilmington del and santa clara calif aug   prnewswire  cutting edge audio technology company max sound corp otcqb maxd has filed trade secret and patent infringement lawsuits in two separate courts against google and its subsidiaries youtube and on technologies the suits allege that google misappropriated proprietary and patented optimized data transmission technology owned by ukbased vedanti systems ltd and its sole shareholder – vsl communications ltd collectively vsl and brought forth in conjunction with max sound corp max sound  which acquired the right to enforce vsls intellectual property rights noted litigation law firm grant  eisenhofer filed the two suits on behalf of max sound and vsl the patent infringement complaint was brought in us district court for the district of delaware and the trade secret suit was filed in superior court of california county of santa clara  intellectual property law firm buether joe  carpenter is cocounsel in both suits while prominent west coast firm walkup melodia kelly  schoenberger is cocounsel in the trade secret action the lawsuits contend that google executives met with vsl over several months in  to discuss the possibility of licensing or acquiring vsls patented optimized data transmission and other proprietary methods which greatly enhance the streaming of audio and video files online  at the time googles own existing standards resulted in jittery lowquality video and sound for largesized files the patent complaint notes  throughout  vsl claims that google gained access to and received technical guidance regarding vsls proprietary codec a computer program capable of encoding or decoding a digital data stream or signal  as the complaint notes vsls codec implemented a proprietary and unique system of optimizing data transmission using methods for key frame positioning slicing and analyzing pixel selection of video content to significantly reduce the volume of digital video files while minimizing any resulting loss of video quality  by any measure vsls technology was far superior to what google had possessed to that point for streaming dense video files online the complaints allege that soon after the two companies initiated negotiations google began implementing vsls technology into its own webmvp video codec without informing vsl and without compensating it for its use the webmvp video codec is widely used by google in numerous products and websites including youtubecom google tv the android operating system and chrome web browser significantly improving delivery of video content to desktop computers laptops tablets and smartphones   plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief against google and compensatory damages as well as treble damages in view of the willful nature of the alleged infringement the use of new technology by established companies should be based on original creation and innovation said adam levitt head of grant  eisenhofers consumer protection practice who is representing the plaintiffs vsl created groundbreaking digital video technology — technology that has forever changed the way that video content is streamed and displayed over the internet  the lawsuits allege that google wilfully infringed vsls patent and was fully aware of the value of its technology while simultaneously recognizing the shortcomings of its own video streaming capabilities at the time  plaintiffs further allege that google met with vsl under false pretenses and misappropriated its proprietary codec and other nonpatented methods incorporating it into googles own video technology – thus violating googles core dont be evil maxim  both suits seek to hold google accountable for its alleged patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation the cases are captioned as vedanti systems ltd and max sound corp v google inc youtube llc and on technologies inc no cv d del filed aug   and max sound corp vsl
