becker  pm      douglas becker chairman and ceo of laureate international universities formerly sylvan learning systems speaks with kelsey hubbard about the future of forprofit higher education       transcript this transcript has been automatically generated and may not be  accuratei  the explosive growth in the for profit college industry going from about three hundred and sixty five thousand seats to about one point eight million in just several years im kelsey hubbard here the world this is forming revisiting is the column im proud to be talking to douglas becker hes the ceo and chairman  of the lorry international indices formerly of sylvan learning centers the onthe that name for the test prep at  services that we now and thank you for being here and talking to us during this tough for  thank you for having me  the attributes that growth in this industry why do you think it has exploded so much in recent years  they were now clearly in a knowledge economy and what people know really relates to how they can earn in  and develop their careers to people are taking much more of an interest in their own education and investing more  in their education  what role tce laureate can actually universities in other for profit colleges playing in the educational landscape right now in the eye in america  i think that whats what people are trying to do is create a access  and access for many people who might not otherwise have had the opportunity to go to university  or maybe offering very specific when each programs  that wouldnt otherwise have been offered in the private sector tends to be extremely  innovative in developing programs that perhaps the public sector might now to develop on their own  alarmingly your or your seems to characterise for many people who  didnt have the opportunity to do a traditional brick and mortar say fouryear  private college or star kicker  muni college or even a public college  will allow for the laurie universities are upside united states and there most of our students are  traditional eighteen to twenty two yearold students  in the u s most of our students are through our walden university  in their graduate students their masters and doctoral level students  working professionals  who are looking for programs to really meet their schedule in the needs  and the demands of their practice in the profession  like getting upper city the common on some of that  criticism of the industry in for profit industry and nationwide in terms of youthful innocence of scrutiny from congress the department of education  and is in deceptive or misleading practices i know your  company has not been cited as it is doing this but what i think this overall its a question answered a few rotten apples are spoiling the reputation of the group or how do you address that this is the  i think the point is its a very diverse sector  and education comes from accredited institutions whether their  for profit or nonprofit  for profit really just means that the taxpayers  and is nothing to be ashamed of in paying taxes  and nonprofit institutions have to justify their tax exemption  which is a privilege  to me its really more about the educational institution  whether to credited  with that they have high standards  whether theyre following the rules  are not following the rules  of the department education has the means to bring them in or shut them down  we would encourage that they should do so  there are always to be some people that are going to make mistakes because it is a sector that serving literally millions of students  i think most of the schools  ten to be very devoted to good outcomes for students  and two and two inclusion in this is a very important point  a lot of the sector serves a very underserved population including a lot of minority students  and a lot of the schools are playing a very integral part  in creating an opportunity to educate  people that otherwise may not have the option  and this really looking at possible regulation coming down to take especially as common as commerce is looking at things roughly ten percent of all tyrants hes attending for profit schools that they account for nearly a quarter of the federal loan  of borrowers and forty three percent of all the de foltz a lot of these teams are taking on these loans they cant keep them back there could be regulation coming down on the page here  affected  why think we actually are proponents of on of stronger regulations we think  that its important or raise the bar  and to get rid of players that are not doing a good job  i think it is important or recognize that the sector includes institutions that are serving  vocational and technical students  all the way up to our students who work for example mostly masters and doctoral level students so its a very very big difference  we tend to have very very los about default rates  and that probably lowest in the industry  so our students to repay their loans  or some other  institutions with the students dont repay their loans  and in some cases thats part of the governments attempts to include more more people  died in the opportunity in experience of getting an education  i hear you did not graduate from college he wanted to get straight into business up to your breath that this is india would you think a college education  in united states today is worth the money  college education is a great investment and it is something that for most people  its an essential part of their journey towards achieving their  career inhibitions that day and their families may have  in fact outside the united states  the differential between what one would earnings if you have a degree versus not easy to much greater than in the united states and thats why a lot of our work  focuses on serving out the pots out of united states  and creating the middle classes in the emerging country so  i think its very worthwhile but it really depends some programs are a lot less worthwhile than others  and some institutions are less worthwhile than others to the students really need to do the research and see if they can understand
