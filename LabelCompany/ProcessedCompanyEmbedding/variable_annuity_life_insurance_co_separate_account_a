life insurance company that is maintained separately from the insurers general assets separate accounts were originally established in response to federal securities laws for investmentlinked variable annuities although it took many years the application of separate accounts has dramatically expanded beyond this simple product design product development has resulted with an array of “hybrid” products—products that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees eg mortality morbidity etc being allocated to the separate account investment portfolio the use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly over the past  years in response to recommendations to clarify information pertaining to separate account products and related separate account assets detailed information is available in the statutory financial statements distinct filings for separate products that are “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general account creditors when completing the insulated separate account filing the reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally insulated by state law or statute in which the state law provides legal protection to the separate account contract holder from the general account liabilities detailed information on the characteristics of separate account assets specifically categorizing separate account assets in accordance with the following characteristics identification of separate account assets legally insulated and those which are not legally insulated identification is also required for all separate account assets not reported at fair value and the measurement basis used for those separate account assets amount of separate account assets that represent seed money other fees and expenses due to the general account and

regulations information is reported on any current year transfers to the separate account for seed money as well as the duration in which seed money other fees and expenses and additional required surplus amounts due to the general account have been held in the separate account identification of separate account assets in which the investment directive is not determined by the contract holder situations in which the investment directive is not determined by the contract holder also require disclosure on whether the investments if included in the general account would have resulted with the reporting entity exceeding any general account investment limitations identification of separate account assets in which less than  of investment proceeds are attributed to the contract holder this also includes identification of the separate account investment income attributed to the reporting entity during the reporting period and whether the income was transferred to the general account or

under us gaap for products with different classifications between statutory accounting and us gaap identification of the characteristics that resulted with a different classification under us gaap

general account provides the foundation of a variable annuity the investment fund options often dozens of mutual funds are referred to as subaccounts in contrast to the general account the separate account is not guaranteed by the insurance company the returns of the subaccounts are variable rather than fixed so the contract holder rather than the insurance company assumes market risk the separate account is “separate” from the general assets of the insurance company so there is no credit risk in the event that the insurer becomes insolvent what is driving the rush for the variable

improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message in the united states an annuity is a contractually executed relatively lowrisk investment product where the insured usually an individual pays a life insurance company a lumpsum premium at the start of the contract that money is to be paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess named in the contract or until a future termination date — whichever occurs first contents  history  general  immediate annuity  annuity with period certain  life annuity  life annuity variants  deferred annuity  features  criticisms of deferred annuities  taxation  insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations  compensation for advisors or salespeople  references  external links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife

paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess

links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife annuities for smokers or those with a

contractually executed relatively lowrisk investment product where the insured usually an individual pays a life insurance company a lumpsum premium at the start of the contract that money is to be paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess named in the contract or until a future termination date — whichever occurs first contents  history  general  immediate annuity  annuity with period certain  life annuity  life annuity variants  deferred annuity  features  criticisms of deferred annuities  taxation  insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations  compensation for advisors or salespeople  references  external links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife annuities for smokers or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies since the life expectancy is reduced the annual payment to the purchaser is raised life annuities are priced based on the probability of the annuitant surviving to receive the payments longevity insurance is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life a common longevity contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until  years after retirement if the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit this drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving ones resources deferred annuityedit the second usage for the term annuity came into being during the s such a contract is more properly referred to as a deferred annuity and is chiefly a vehicle for accumulating savings with a view to eventually distributing them either in the manner of an immediate annuity or as a lumpsum payment all varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn this is also known as taxdeferred growth a deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a fixed deferred annuity fa a deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a variable annuity va a new category of deferred annuity called the fixed indexed annuity fia emerged in  originally called an equityindexed annuity fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities the insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for eia an investor can still lose money if he or she cancels or surrenders the policy early before a break even period an oversimplified expression of a typical eias rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated participation rate multiplied by a target stock market indexs performance excluding dividends interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable deferred annuities in the united states have the advantage that taxation of all capital gains and ordinary income is deferred until withdrawn in theory such taxdeferred compounding allows more money to be put to work while the savings are accumulating leading to higher returns a disadvantage however is that when amounts held under a deferred annuity are withdrawn or inherited the interestgains are immediately taxed as ordinary income featuresedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message a variety of features and guarantees have been developed by insurance companies in order to make annuity products more attractive these include death and living benefit options extra credit options account guarantees spousal continuation benefits reduced contingent deferred sales charges or surrender charges and various combinations thereof each feature or benefit added to a contract will typically be accompanied by an additional expense either directly billed to client or indirectly inside product deferred annuities are usually divided into two different kinds fixed annuities offer some sort of guaranteed rate of return over the life of the contract in general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank cds and offer a rate of return competitive with those of cds of similar time frames many fixed annuities however do not have a fixed rate of return over the life of the contract offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate the rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance companys discretion subject however to the minimum amount typically  there are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest andor principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty usually the interest earned in a month period or  unlike most cds fixed annuities normally become fully liquid depending on the surrender schedule or upon the owners death most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index usually the sp  or the dow jones industrial average these products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps spreads margins and crediting methods that can reduce returns these products also dont pay any of the participating market indices dividends the tradeoff is that contract holder can never earn less than  in a negative year variable annuities allow money to be invested in insurance company separate accounts which are sometimes referred to as subaccounts and in any case are functionally similar to mutual funds in a taxdeferred manner their primary use is to allow an investor to engage in taxdeferred investing for retirement in amounts greater than permitted by individual retirement or k plans in addition many variable annuity contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return either for a future withdrawal andor in the case of the owners death even if the underlying separate account investments perform poorly this can be attractive to people uncomfortable investing in the equity markets without the guarantees of course an investor will pay for each benefit provided by a variable annuity since insurance companies must charge a premium to cover the insurance guarantees of such benefits variable annuities are regulated both by the individual states as insurance products and by the securities and exchange commission as securities under the federal securities laws the sec requires that all of the charges under variable annuities be described in great detail in the prospectus that is offered to each variable annuity customer of course potential customers should review these charges carefully just as one would in purchasing mutual fund shares people who sell variable annuities are usually regulated by finra whose rules of conduct require a careful analysis of the suitability of variable annuities and other securities products to those to whom they recommend such products these products are often criticized as being sold to the wrong persons who could have done better investing in a more suitable alternative since the commissions paid under this product are often high relative to other investment products there are several types of performance guarantees and one may often choose them à la carte with higher risk charges for guarantees that are riskier for the insurance companies the first type is a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which can be received only if the owner of the annuity contract or the covered annuitant dies gmdbs come in various flavors in order of increasing risk to the insurance company return of premium a guarantee that you will not have a negative return rollup of premium at a particular rate a guarantee that you will achieve a minimum rate of return greater than  maximum anniversary value looks back at account value on the anniversaries and guarantees you will get at least as much as the highest values upon death greater of maximum anniversary value or particular rollup insurance companies provide even greater insurance coverage on guaranteed living benefits which tend to be elective unlike death benefits which the contractholder generally cannot time living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most annuities with guaranteed living benefits glbs tend to have high fees commensurate with the additional risks underwritten by the issuing insurer some glb examples in no particular order guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib a guarantee that one will get a minimum income stream upon annuitization at a particular point in the future guaranteed minimum accumulation lbenefit gmab a guarantee that the account value will be at a certain amount at a certain point in the future guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb a guarantee similar to the income benefit but one that doesnt require annuitizing guaranteedforlife income benefit a guarantee similar to a withdrawal benefit where withdrawals begin and continue until cash value becomes zero withdrawals stop when cash value is zero and then annuitization occurs on the guaranteed benefit amount for a payment amount that is not determined until annuitization date recently insurance companies developed assettransfer programs that operate at the contract level or the fund level in the former a percentage of clients account value will be transferred to a designated lowrisk fund when the contract has poor investment performance on the fund level certain investment options have a target volatility built within the fund usually about  and will rebalance to maintain that target in both cases they are stated to help buffer poor investment performance until markets perform better where they will transition back to normal allocations to catch an upswing however there are criticisms of these programs including but not limited to often mandating these programs on clients restricting flexibility of investing and not catching the upswing of markets fast enough due to the underlying design of such programs be careful in regard to using glb riders in nonqualified contracts as most of the products in the annuity marketplace today create a  taxable income benefit whereas income generated from an immediate annuity in a nonqualified contract would partially be a return of principal and therefore nontaxable criticisms of deferred annuitiesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message some annuities do not have any deferred surrender charges and do not pay the financial professional a commission although the financial professional may charge a fee for his or her advice these contracts are called noload variable annuity products and are usually available from a feebased financial planner or directly from a noload mutual fund company of course various charges are still imposed on these contracts but they are less than those sold by commissioned brokers it is important that potential purchasers of annuities mutual funds taxexempt municipal bonds commodities futures interest rate swaps in short any financial instrument understand the fees on the product and the fees a financial planner may charge variable annuities are controversial because many believe the extra fees ie the fees above and beyond those charged for similar retail mutual funds that offer no principal protection or guarantees of any kind may reduce the rate of return compared to what the investor could make by investing directly in similar investments outside of the variable annuity a big selling point for variable annuities is the guarantees many have such as the guarantee that the customer will not lose his or her principal critics say that these guarantees are not necessary because over the long term the market has always been positive while others say that with the uncertainty of the financial markets many investors simply will not invest without guaranteeswho past returns are no guarantee of future performance of course and different investors have different risk tolerances different investment horizons different family situations and so on the sale of any security product should involve a careful analysis of the suitability of the product for a given individual taxationedit in the us internal revenue code the growth of the annuity value during the accumulation phase is taxdeferred that is not subject to current income tax for annuities owned by individuals the tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the united states under the us tax code the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken in the form of a fixed stream of payments annuitization and many annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income if an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an ira funding vehicle then  of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity it should be noted this is the same tax treatment of direct participation in a qualified pension plan such as a k again due to the fact the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the plan if the annuity contract is purchased with aftertax dollars then the contract holder upon annuitization recovers his basis prorata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value according to the tax regulation section  this is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio after the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis then  of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax since the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the use of variable annuities as a tax shelter has greatly diminished because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the dividends of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates this taxation contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of variable annuities at income rates means that in most cases variable annuities shouldnt be used for tax shelters unless very long holding periods apply for example more than  years insurance company default risk and state guaranty associationsedit main article guaranty association an investor should consider the financial strength of the insurance company that writes annuity contracts major insolvencies have occurred at least  times since the conspicuous collapse of the executive life insurance company in  insurance company defaults are governed by state law the laws are however broadly similar in most states annuity contracts are protected against insurance company insolvency up to a specific dollar limit often  but as high as  in new york  new jersey  and the state of washington  california is the only state that has a limit less than  the limit is  up to  this protection is not insurance and is not provided by a government agency it is provided by an entity called the state guaranty association when an insolvency occurs the guaranty association steps in to protect annuity holders and decides what to do on a casebycase basis sometimes the contracts will be taken over and fulfilled by a solvent insurance company the state guaranty association is not a government agency but states usually require insurance companies to belong to it as a condition of being licensed to do business the guaranty associations of the fifty states are members of a national umbrella association the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations nolhga the nolhga website provides a description of the organization links to websites for the individual state organizations and links to the actual text of the governing state laws a difference between guaranty association protection and the protection of bank accounts by the fdic credit union accounts by the ncua and brokerage accounts by the sipc is that it is difficult for consumers to learn about this protection usually state law prohibits insurance agents and companies from using the guaranty association in any advertising and agents are prohibited by statute from using this web site or the existence of the guaranty association as an inducement to purchase insuranceeg
