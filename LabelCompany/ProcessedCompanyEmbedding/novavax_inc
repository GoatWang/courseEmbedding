‘mimic’ viruses and elicit naturally occurring immune responses to them our nanoparticles are engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses which may be more efficacious than naturallyoccurring immunity our vaccine technology has the potential to be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseasesrespiratory syncytial virus fprotein nanoparticle vaccine candidate rsv f vaccinewe are developing our respiratory syncytial virus fusion f protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate rsv f vaccine for three susceptible target populations infants via maternal immunization older adults  years of age and older and children six months to five years of age pediatrics we believe our rsv f vaccine represents a multibillion dollar commercial opportunity currently there is no approved rsv vaccine availablerepeat infections and lifelong susceptibility to rsv are common and we currently estimate the annual global cost burden of rsv to be in excess of  billion despite decades of effort to develop an rsv vaccine there are currently no licensed vaccines although the monoclonal antibody palivizumab synagis® is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by rsv in children at high risk of rsv disease it is not indicated for use in other populations we made a breakthrough in developing a vaccine that targets the fusion protein or fprotein of the rsv virus t the fprotein has highly conserved amino acid sequences called antigenic sites which we believe are ideal vaccine targets palivizumab which also targets antigenic site ii has demonstrated protection in five randomized clinical trialswe genetically engineered a novel fprotein antigen resulting in enhanced immunogenicity by exposing these antigenic sites the novavax rsv f vaccine assembles into a recombinant protein nanoparticle optimized for fprotein antigen presentation we are seeking to bring the first rsv vaccine to market to combat the  million rsv infections that occur globally each year                rsv infants via maternal immunization programrsv is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide in the us rsv is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants and globally is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age despite the induction of postinfection immunity repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to rsv is commonwe initiated prepare a global pivotal phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in  to  healthy pregnant women in december  the primary objective of the prepare trial is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the rsv f vaccine against symptomatic rsv lower respiratory tract infection with hypoxemia in infants through a minimum of the first  days of life this phase  trial utilizes a group sequential design and is expected to take between three and four years to complete we are currently in discussion with the us food and drug administration center for biologics evaluation and research fda about conducting an informational analysis of the prepare trial in late  these discussions lead us to believe we will be allowed to conduct an informational analysis that would provide an indication of the vaccine’s potential efficacy against the primary endpointthe phase  trial is supported by a grant of up to  million from bmgf the grant supports development activities product licensing efforts and world health organization who prequalification of our rsv f vaccine in  along with the grant agreement we concurrently entered into a global access commitments agreement gaca with bmgf under which we agreed to make the rsv f vaccine available and accessible at affordable pricing to people in certain low and middle income countriesin september  we announced positive topline data from a phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in  healthy pregnant women and their infants this clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our rsv f vaccine in pregnant women in their third trimester and assessed the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine the trial also examined the impact of maternal immunization on infant safety during the first year of life and rsvspecific antibody levels through the infants’ first six months of life immunized women demonstrated a geometric mean fold rise in antif igg fold rise in palivizumabcompeting antibodies and a  and fold rise in microneutralization titers against rsva and rsvb respectively in contrast women who received placebo demonstrated no significant change in antibody levels the infants’ antibody levels at delivery

maternal immunization fast track designation is intended for products that treat serious or lifethreatening diseases or conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions the program is designed to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and lifethreatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously rsv older adult programadults  years of age and older are at increased risk for rsv disease due to immunosenescence the agerelated decline in the human immune system in this population rsv is an important respiratory virus distinct from influenza that is frequently responsible for serious lower respiratory tract disease and may lead to hospitalization or even death additionally rsv infection can lead to exacerbation of underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma and congestive heart failure in the us the incidence rate is approximately  million infections per year and rsv is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of  million older adultssup stylewhitespace nowrap based on our analysis of published literature applied to  population estimates the disease causes  hospitalizations and  deaths among adults older than  annually we estimate that there are approximately  medical interventions directly caused by rsv disease across all populationsin january  we announced the initiation of a phase  clinical trial of the rsv f vaccine in older adults the objective of this phase  trial is to assess safety and immunogenicity to one and two dose regimens of the rsv f vaccine with and without aluminum phosphate or novavax’ proprietary matrixm adjuvant in older adults the trial is a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled trial which has enrolled  older adults in the southern hemisphere participants were enrolled and vaccinated outside of the rsv season to best assess immunogenicity with topline data expected in the third quarter of we announced topline data from the phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in older adults known as resolve in the third quarter of  resolve a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled trial began in november  and was fully enrolled with  older adult subjects at  sites in the us by december  historically annual seasonal attack rates for all symptomatic respiratory disease due to rsv rsv ard of between  and  have been observed in older adults  in our phase  trial conducted during the  rsv season we observed an rsv ard attack rate of  with an attack rate of  for moderatesevere rsvassociated lower respiratory tract disease rsv mslrtd in the resolve trial in contrast we observed an rsv ard attack rate of  and an rsv mslrtd attack rate of  these unexpectedly low attack rates indicate a mild rsv season in older adults the trial did not meet the prespecified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy the primary objective of the resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderatesevere rsvassociated lower respiratory tract disease rsv mslrtd as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms the secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the rsv f vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to rsv rsv ard the trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted  microgram dose of the rsv f vaccine compared to placebo and consistent with our previous clinical experience the vaccine was welltoleratedin september  we announced topline data from the phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in older adults known as resolve resolve was a

incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to rsv rsv ard the trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted  microgram dose of the rsv f vaccine compared to placebo and consistent with our previous clinical experience the vaccine was welltolerated we continue to analyze data from the resolve trial in order to better understand these results and to map a path forward for this important program our efforts include analyses of existing immunogenicity and efficacy data and application of new assays to archived samples we have also undertaken external epidemiology studies to further understand the attack rate healthcare burden and seasonality of rsv disease in older adults we expect these analyses to provide important information and context when we review the results from the phase  clinical trial in older adults that we initiated in january  and evaluate our next stepsthe rollover trial demonstrated immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients with a fold increase in antif igg in the placebovaccine arm consistent with the phase  efficacy trial there was higher antif igg at baseline in the vaccinevaccine arm compared to the placebovaccine arm and the vaccinevaccine arm showed a greater than fold increase in antif igg from the higher baseline the rollover trial confirmed the low attack rates witnessed during the resolve trialin august  we announced positive topline data from a phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in  older adults the clinical trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with rsv infection in communityliving older adults who were treated with placebo the trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of our rsv f vaccine compared to placebo finally the trial estimated the efficacy of our rsv f vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to rsv the trial was the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active rsv immunization in any clinical trial population in the per protocol population the clinical trial showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic rsv disease  and in an ad hoc analysis showed a decrease in rsv disease with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection  in older adults the clinical trial established an attack rate for symptomatic rsv disease of  in older adults  of which included lower respiratory track symptoms efficacy against more severe rsv illness defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms associated with difficulty breathing was  in ad hoc analyses rsv pediatric programthere are currently approximately  million children in the us between six months and five years of age  in the us rsv is responsible for approximately  hospitalizations of children under five years of age annually the vast majority of which occur in infants less than one year old and especially those under six months of agein september  we announced positive topline data from a phase  clinical trial of our rsv f vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age this clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our rsv f vaccine with one or two doses with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant trial enrollment was concluded with a smaller than planned cohort so that dosing could be completed ahead of the  rsv season the vaccine was welltolerated and serum samples collected from a subset of  immunized children in the perprotocol population demonstrated that the rsv f vaccine was highly immunogenic at all formulations and regimens there were greater than fold increases in both antif igg and pca antibody titers in the adjuvanted group and greater than fold increases in antif igg and pca antibody titers in the unadjuvanted group we are assessing the next steps in the development of our rsv f vaccine for pediatrics seasonal influenzainfluenza is a worldwide infectious disease that causes illness in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to lifethreatening or even death serious illness occurs not only in susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults but also in the general population but also in the general population largely because of unique strains of influenza for which most humans have not developed protective antibodies current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccine growth in the top seven markets us japan france germany italy spain and uk show a potential increase from approximately  billion in the  season to  billion by the  seasonthe advisory committee for immunization practices of the center for disease control and prevention cdc recommends that all persons aged six months and older be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza influenza is a major burden on public health worldwide an estimated one million deaths each year are attributed to influenza it is further estimated that each year influenza attacks between  and  of adults and  to  of children causing significant levels of illness hospitalization and death recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines like the candidate we are developing have an important advantage once licensed for commercial sale large quantities of vaccines can potentially be manufactured quickly and in a costeffective manner without the use of either the live influenza virus or eggsafter many years of developing seasonal influenza vaccine candidates as vlps we have identified advantages of developing a nanoparticlebased seasonal influenza vaccine in particular influenza nanoparticles can display conserved antigenic regions which have the potential to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that may offer protection against a range of drifted strains additionally nanoparticles offer improved purity and manufacturability and advantages for coformulation with other nanoparticlebased vaccines we expect to continue to develop our nanoparticle influenza vaccine program into  with an ongoing goal of generating additional proofofconcept data combination respiratory vaccine influenza and rsvgiven the ongoing development of our rsv f vaccine and our nanoparticlebased seasonal influenza vaccines we continue to believe in the longterm opportunity to develop a combination rsvinfluenza respiratory vaccine early preclinical development efforts give us confidence that such a combination vaccine is feasibleemerging diseaseebola virusebola virus ebov formerly known as ebola hemorrhagic fever is a severe often fatal illness in humans multiple strains of ebov have been identified the most recent of which the makona strain is associated with a case fatality rate of between  and  there are currently no licensed treatments proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood immunological and drug therapies are under development despite the development of such therapies current vaccine approaches target either a previous strain of the virus or were initially developed to be delivered by genetic vectors in contrast our ebov glycoprotein vaccine candidate ebola gp vaccinewas developed using the makona ebov strain  in july  we announced data from our phase  clinical trial of our ebola gp vaccine in ascending doses with and without our matrixm adjuvant in  healthy adults participants received either one or two intramuscular injections with or without adjuvant or placebo and immunogenicity was assessed at multiple time points including days  and  these phase  data demonstrated that our ebola gp vaccine is highly immunogenic welltolerated and in conjunction with our proprietary matrixm adjuvant resulted in significant antigen dosesparing although the adjuvanted ebola gp vaccine was highly immunogenic at all dose levels the adjuvanted twodose regimens induced ebola antigp antibody geometric mean responses between  and  elisa units representing a  to fold rise over baseline at day  in  we also announced successful data from two separate nonhuman primate challenge studies of our ebola gp vaccine in which in both cases the challenge was lethal for the control animal whereas  of the immunized animals were protected zikv envd vaccinewe initiated development of a vaccine against the zika virus zikv in response to the unmet global medical need for a response to this serious disease beginning in  zikv spread in south central and north america via mosquitoborne and sexual transmission although acute zikv infections in adults are generally either asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms fever joint pains and skin rash more serious outcomes can occur including guillainbarré syndrome in adults and microcephaly in infants of women infected during pregnancy there is no approved vaccine against zikv although a number of companies have announced vaccine development efforts we are currently conducting indenabling preclinical studies including studies in nonhuman primates and other animal models with the goal of initiating a

ammunition  novavax inc nasdaqnvax  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»novavaxs pipeline plenty of ammunitionjun   about novavax inc nvax upside research longshort equity deep value value growth at reasonable pricesummarywidespread misinformation in articles and comments has caused fear among investors resulting in a great buying opportunity one of the main areas of incorrect information is the claim that novavax had only one backup or no backups to its older adults rsv vaccine in fact the company and its partners have  product candidates four of which would each produce over  billion in revenue novavax also has several funding options for funding its cash needs in the future when seeking alpha one of the best ways to find alpha is to follow warren buffetts core advice to buy fear sell greed in the case of novavax nasdaqnvax excessive irrational fear has come from three things  lack of awareness of the welldocumented science that low attack rate seasons make vaccine trials useless in evaluating efficacy as described in my last article novavaxs phase  trial of its older adults rsv vaccine took place during the lowest attack rate season on record the result caused a fear that the older adults rsv vaccine has almost no chance of succeeding  the normal dynamics related to technicals and momentum when a stock declines some people become fearful and sell based on emotion others avoid buying trend momentum traders pile on sometimes via computer algorithms short selling the stock to capitalize on the trend this causes investors more pain and makes them feel even more fearful which leads to more selling and more fear a classic vicious circle and one that is a great place to look for a great buying opportunity over the last two weeks weve started to see the momentum move in the opposite direction as the stock has gained more than  the things like technical and momentum trading that hurt a stock on the way down often help it on the way up i think this is probably going to help nvax in the coming weeks and months  a torrent of incorrect information in media articles and from shortsellers as this investopedia article states an advantage in investing in smallcap stocks is the potential for discovering unknown value the general rule of the investment world is that the majority of wall street research is aimed at a fraction of publicly traded companies and most of these companies are large cap smallcap companies fly more under the radar and therefore hold greater potential for finding undervalued stocks misinformation is far worse than a lack of information for a stocks price but it also means a far greater opportunity to gain from the gap between the misinformation and the correct information to be fair information being off a small amount of time is reasonable nobody is perfect and everybody from time to time gets a detail wrong however the sheer quantity of false claims about novavax is staggering and indicates some likelihood of a smear campaign on the part of short sellers aiming to profit from the misinformation this article will focus on the false assertions that novavax had no backups in place or only had one backup in its pipeline for example this motley fool article claims what makes this biotech stock so risky though is the lack of backup candidates in the companys clinicalstage pipeline in fact the company has numerous vaccines in its pipeline including zika vaccine last november novavax said its zika preclinical data showed the companys vaccine technology produces uniquely neutralizing antibodies at levels considered well above necessary for protection since then novavax has been partnering with harvard universitys center for virology and vaccine research the centers director dr dan barouch has been doing nonhuman primate studies of novavaxs vaccine with positive results the company plans to do a phase  trial on humans later this year on may  of this year the indian government reported the first three cases of zika in the country this is significant news because the population of the country is  billion people during the winter the weather is cold in most of the united states so awareness of the threat of zika has recently faded from peoples minds however scientists say that the unusually warm winter means that the populations of mosquitos that carry zika will be high this year on the companys q conference call in february piper jaffrays senior biotech research analyst edward tenthoff said i dont think this is going away by any means to make matters worse biologists discovered in april the disturbing news that a second type of mosquito common in florida the aedes albopictus also can carry zika … the aedes albopictus habitat extends to maine and minnesota farther north into the united states than the aedes aegyptis range so smartts finding raises the possibility of zika outbreaks farther north a study published may  in the journal nature revealed that zika usually spreads to new areas  to  months before its even detected so it very possible it will spread to more us states before those states discover the problem while zika in the us may never reach the levels it has in other countries the fact that it can be transmitted sexually and can have severe effects such as microcephaly in newborns and guillainbarre syndrone in adults means it is possible that broad vaccination against zika much like is done with hpv could be recommended wrote cantor fitzgeralds analyst william tanner in a research note to investors in january as the washington post notes babies born to zikainfected mothers have been found to have microcephaly or a birth defect where the head is abnormally small and brains might not have developed properly guillainbarre syndrome is a disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system in this article in the new england journal of medicine a group of vaccine experts states that hpv vaccination begins at ages  to  and that a similar approach should be used for zika given the need to protect girls before they reach childbearing age a tpp should address vaccination starting at  years of age and in people of both sexes given evidence of zikv in semen up to  months after infection this starting age would align with who recommendations and with the precedent set by human papillomavirus vaccines they said this should be done even if the levels of infection subside due to the risks of microcephaly in newborns and guillainbarre syndrome in adults and the fact that the virus is sexually transmitted they said  million doses will be needed annually in the us alone that is an enormous market opportunity if the vaccines sell for  that is  billion in revenues annually in the us alone which is larger than the market for rsv which is limited to infants and adults over  the vaccine for pneumonia sells for about  so on the upside its entirely possible a zika vaccine could sell for more than  and the market opportunity could be bigger than above also the us is only one market and zika is an international problem on the downside its also entirely possible that novavaxs vaccine wont succeed given that its early in the development process when valuing biotech stocks the most common approach is the discounted free cash flow approach in which you take the expected amount of sales if a product is approved and then reduce that by the chances that it will be approved and by the cost of developing the product only about  of drugs that start the development process make it through to approval so in doing your calculation you probably shouldnt give it better than a  chance however the market opportunity is huge in addition if the phase  trial is positive the costs of developing the zika vaccine have a good chance of being paid for by governments andor foundations novavaxs president of research and development dr greg glenn in february said i dont think theres ever been a precedent like this with respect to a virus causing such severe outcome guillainbarré and birth defects so i think that the government seems to be quite committed to seeing the vaccine pull through the article above plus a second article in the new england journal of medicine both said rapid development of a vaccine is needed if the trial is successful theres a reasonable chance that the us government foreign governments such as indias andor charitable foundations will fund development of the vaccine if not novavax will probably partner with a larger company to fund the phase  and  trials in exchange for a percentage of future profits last year glenn said we will work with various government and nongovernment groups to determine the pathway forward to fund our largescale production and clinical trials in november buck phillips novavaxs cfo said we think the us government is recognizing this is an important pathogen and we know that there is funding activity going on i think we will be poised to start to try to obtain that funding in the coming year james cummings vice president of clinical development and translational medicine added that novavax is looking at multiple lines of external funding from other government sources as well as from barda regarding the zika vaccine ceo stan erck noted an additional economic benefit is the potential to receive a priority review voucher under the fdas program in recent years these vouchers have turned out to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars he noted that novavax has a promising track record of obtaining fasttrack designation from the fda hes referring to the food and drug administrations priority review program in which they give out lucrative fasttrack vouchers as the washington business journal notes these vouchers are bought and sold by companies and in recent years they have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars maternal rsv vaccine while most articles about novavax have mentioned its current phase  trial of its maternal rsv vaccine there has been significant misinformation about the vaccine writers at the motley fool have been among the worst offenders for example a few articles including this one earlier this year have implied that the phase  trial wont be completed for another four years in fact the trial could take as little as three years and started earlier than planned in addition the trial is already past the midway point and novavax is expected to do an interim informational analysis of the results later this year as of last november the company reported it had already completed year one in the us south africa australia new zealand and chile in february the company said it was at the midway point of the trial yes it has some time to go but implying that investors will have to wait for four years is wrong another common claim has been that the maternal rsv vaccine has only a slim chance of succeeding due to the older adults phase  trial not succeeding this is incorrect in two ways firstly articles and commenters who make this claim fail to mention the scientific data and consensus that low attack rate seasons make trials meaningless in assessing efficacy low attack rate seasons require a doover even in the rare couple of instances that articles mention the low attack rate season they frame it as a false excuse on the part of the company and dont even mention the extensive scientific data secondly the maternal rsv vaccine is different than the older adults rsv vaccine they use different mechanisms of action so even if the mechanism of action in the older adults vaccine turns out to fail it doesnt mean the mechanism of the maternal vaccine will also fail in addition rsv attack rates are more consistent among infants than older adults so the chance of a low attack rate season is low plus the maternal rsv vaccine is being done over the course of about  to  rsv seasons  in the northern hemisphere and  in the southern hemisphere so even if there is one low attack rate season it wont prevent the results from being usable some of the other misinformation about the maternal vaccine has been subtler in this article the writer says while novavax chose to push forward with its maternal immunization program anyway i think that the risk of another failure is unfortunately quite high that implies novavax is imprudently pushing forward with spending its money on the maternal trial when it should not be in fact the program is being paid for by the gates foundation so it would not make sense to end it it also likely would be in violation of its contract with the gates foundation which could result in a lawsuit the writer conveys that continuing the trial is stupid when the opposite is the case ending it would be stupid in fact in november the company said the maternal rsv vaccine program would be its primary focus in the coming months and rightly so even the bears agree that if the vaccine is approved it will probably have annual sales of over  billion as this motley fool bear says with respect to infant mortality worldwide the rsv virus is second only to malaria and an fda green light for this indication would almost certainly result in annual sales of over  billion every year about  million new babies are born in the us almost all analysts agree sales would be over  billion the normal price to sales multiple of biotech companies is between  and  using a multiple of  nvax would likely have a market cap of  billion which is  higher than its current market cap of about  million from that one vaccine alone conveying that novavax is being rash to continue a trial being paid for by someone else that could result in a  gain is ludicrous older adults rsv vaccine in the same article the motley fool author misrepresents the new phase  trial of the older adults vaccine saying unfortunately … the doubledose regimen in older adults is intended for just  patients by comparison the previously successful study that lifted hopes enrolled about  patients he doesnt at all understand the goal of the current phase  trial its not in any way shape or form trying to emulate the previous phase  after the low attack rate season since a doover was needed the company could have simply reran the same trial again with a single dose it might well still do that however it decided to test the immune responses that occur if the same vaccine is combined with different adjuvants and if two doses are given if the physical immune levels go higher with one of those approaches that use the same exact vaccine then it will run a similar phase  trial with that approach there is no need to redo a large sized phase  with  patients for the vaccine  patients is enough for measuring physical immunological responses to find the best method of delivery of the same vaccine for full details on the current phase  see the last article i wrote and just for some context related to attack rates in early  during its original phase  of the older adults vaccine the company said the lowest attack rate that would be viable for evaluating efficacy would be  i think we want to see an attack rate in rsv that looks like the literature so somewhere between  to  would be an acceptable attack rate in our view the attack rate in the season of the phase  trial was under  which is six times lower than the low end of the acceptable range for assessing efficacy after the phase  ceo stan erck noted we have a preponderance of data that tell a consistent story of the effectiveness of our vaccine over many years we have consistently shown in well accepted animal models that our vaccine stimulates a robust immune response in every way that we could measure… we have consistently shown … that our vaccine protects these animals when vaccinated and then challenged with rsv and in  clinical trials with pediatrics women of childbearing age pregnant women healthy adults and in the older adult population we have consistently shown robust immune system responses by every measurement that we have the low attack rate trial was the only trial out of a large amount of trials that hasnt shown efficacy and the only difference between it and all the others is that the rsv attack rate was far lower than normal so attempts to claim the rsv vaccine has little chance of success are dubious seasonal flu vaccine the strains of the flu change every year and vaccine makers do their best to predict what strains to vaccinate people against the central problem is that current vaccines use an approach involving egg embryos and the process of manufacturing the vaccines takes about  to  months so the vaccine experts must choose several months ahead of time which strains to include in the upcoming seasons shot by the time the season arrives it many times turns out to be a different strain or has mutated into a new strain novavaxs recombinant nanoparticle technology doesnt use egg embryos so it can manufacture its vaccine in half the time that current flu vaccines require thus if its flu vaccine is successful it will have a huge advantage over other flu vaccines experts will be able to wait until two months before the flu season begins to choose which strains to include in the shot this would dramatically increase the chances that they make the right picks vernon bernardino the analyst at fbr capital markets said novavaxs vaccine would definitely be a highly differentiated vaccine creating a new paradigm for sure novavax is doing a phase  trial of its seasonal flu vaccine later this year which also uses its matrix m technology a report by global data said clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of matrixm on existing seasonal influenza vaccine formulations in the elderly have reported increased seroconversion and seroprotection rates of virus h neutralization antibodies compared with unadjuvanted controls capitalizing on its nanoparticle platform novavax is spearheading what globaldata anticipates to be a paradigm shift in seasonal influenza vaccine design the seasonal flu vaccine is early in the process so you probably shouldnt be assigning it more than a  chance of success for market size the flu market is enormous its actually bigger than the rsv market in population because the flu shot is often recommended for all people whereas an rsv vaccine would be recommended for adults over  and children under about  you need to adjust this though because an rsv vaccine would fetch a much higher price than a flu vaccine due to lack of competition while a maternal rsv vaccine would see over  billion in revenues analysts forecast an older adults vaccine would reach over  billion in sales i forecast an approved novavax flu vaccine would reach between  billion and  billion in sales annually there is existing competition in the flu market but nvaxs vaccine would have a tremendous advantage over existing vaccines if its ability to let experts choose which strains to protect against just before the season starts results in higher efficacy than the egg embryo vaccines then it will probably dominate the market the global data report states if novavaxs pipeline candidate is approved globaldata expects that such a novel vaccine boasting a nanoparticlebased design approach would send shockwaves through the seasonal influenza vaccines marketplace as it would be the first successful attempt at producing a universal influenza vaccine with the added potential for applicability across other indications thus besides its older adults rsv vaccine still having a good likelihood of succeeding in its next phase  the company has three very high revenue candidates in its pipeline if only one succeeds theyd most likely see sales of  billion to  billion depending on which were approved with a price to sales ratio of  the companys market cap would be between  billion and  billion if more than one succeeds revenues would be between about  billion and  billion depending on which two are approved the two risks for the company are that none of its many pipeline products are approved and that the company has to do major dilution some time in the next year and a half when its cash it slated to be used up later in this article i will do an initial discussion of the risk of dilution and in the future i will dedicate an entire article to the topic on the topic of the potential of none of its products being approved that is the case for all clinical stage biotech companies by their very nature there is a very large payoff if a product is approved and a serious loss if none are approved some products have very large markets and have a giant payoff and some have small markets with a smaller payoff likewise a company with only one product in its pipeline is a higher risk than a company with five products in its pipeline including its joint ventures and partnerships novavax has  products in its pipeline here are some other vaccines with small to midsized potential revenue streams malaria vaccine in  novavax formed a joint venture with its partner cadila pharmaceuticals to use novavaxs proprietary vaccine technology to develop and manufacture vaccines for the indian market and other overseas markets in  the two companies announced the joint venture was developing a malaria vaccine with funding from indias department of biotechnology vaccine grand challenge program the program is also being supported by the malaria vaccine development program a notforprofit organization established to support the development of malaria vaccines the international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology icgeb based in india italy and south africa is also involved malaria is the largest killer of infants worldwide so a vaccine for it would be a huge market novavax doesnt list the malaria vaccine in its pipeline because cadila has a majority stake in the joint venture but novavax would benefit greatly if this vaccine succeeds and its not costing the company anything rabies vaccine novavaxs joint venture with cadila also has a rabies vaccine that novavax genetically engineered the vaccine is now in a phase  trial novavaxs  annual report said the vaccine can be administered both as a preexposure and a postexposure prophylactic regimen the postexposure regimen has the potential to use fewer doses three doses than the current standard of care five doses the joint venture also received marketing authorization for its seasonal flu vaccine from the indian government which is the indian equivalent of approval of a biologics license application the company is currently manufacturing and selling the vaccine it should be noted that this vaccine uses novavaxs previous vlp technology which has since been improved on by its nanoparticle matrix m technology combination rsv  flu vaccine the global data report notes novavax is also planning to investigate a combination respiratory vaccine that merges its seasonal influenza nanoparticle vaccine with the rsv f vaccine an approach globaldata views as a potential gamechanger for the prevention of these two infections particularly in young children and the elderly it added ultimately possession of a nanoparticle vaccine that protects against both rsv and influenza would immediately catapult novavax into a leading position in the competitive landscape for both these infections doctors and pharmacies would far prefer to give their patients one shot instead of two patients of course would also prefer one shot instead of two infant rsv vaccine the maternal rsv vaccine would immunize infants from birth to six months the company is working on a vaccine for infants aged  months to  years therefore this is actually a bigger market than the maternal rsv vaccine novavax has completed a successful phase  trial for the vaccine since it already has two other rsv trials in progress its put the infant vaccine on the back burner so it can put some time and money to nonrsv vaccines like zika and seasonal flu ebola during the last major outbreak of ebola in  and  that killed  people novavax developed an ebola vaccine that had a successful phase  trial i believe that we have made the best ebola vaccine and shown that it works the company said however the outbreak subsided so the vaccine was put on the shelf a couple of weeks ago ebola resurfaced in the democratic republic of congo but its currently a small outbreak and is very much under control the size of the ebola market is relatively small so this vaccine would be a minor one at best western countries have proven very adept at preventing the virus from entering or spreading in their countries wealthy countries are also committed to keeping it under control in africa so it doesnt spread so the market for this will probably never be large pandemic flu the us department of health and human services office of biomedical advanced research and development authority barda spent  million advancing novavaxs pandemic flu vaccine from  to  and then decided to spent another  million to advance it further in  and  at present while it awaits more funding to continue the development it appears the company has put development of this on hold given that its not showing on its current pipeline chart that said the national institutes of health nih has written that by far the most lucrative business opportunity is created by pandemic influenza due to the number of vaccinations needed also most governments in industrialized countries consider it their responsibility to prepare for flu pandemics the article says pandemic influenza preparedness efforts are largely aligned with world health organizations advice to national governments on societal antiviral and vaccine strategies based on monitoring the threatlevel of emerging potential pandemic influenza viruses since purchasing vaccines for immunization campaigns is coordinated by national governments they are responsible for ensuring sufficient access from the early stages of an influenza pandemic onward the us government views novavax positively because its matrix m vaccine technology allows for quick creation of new vaccines they can take any pandemic molecule provided by the world health organization and within weeks produce a vaccine from it when a pandemic begins governments need a vaccine created quickly and manufactured quickly not the normal  to  months that egg embryos take you can read more about novavaxs nanoparticle here matrix m technology on the last earnings call novavax announced that a number of other researchers and companies are using its proprietary matrix m adjuvant in their products for example genocea biosciences developed a genital herpes vaccine using novavaxs matrix m adjuvant and their vaccine was recently awarded the world vaccine congress  industry excellence award for the best therapeutic vaccine genocea plans to start a phase  trial in the fourth quarter novavax said our matrixm adjuvant is an important component of this vaccine and we are pleased to be collaborating with genocea on the continued development of this important new vaccine product if the vaccine is approved novavax will get a percentage of all sales the company also said researchers at oxford university are conducting a phase  challenge trial with a novel malaria vaccine candidate that uses matrixm as a critical component the oxford team had already had positive results with development of its malaria vaccine but needed something to improve it further and settled on matrix m as the best solution glenn said that the oxford team published data in the journal nature that showed enhancement of immunogenic and efficacy of their vaccine candidate based on the use of matrix m along with novavaxs rsv vaccine development program this data provided additional external validation of the value of matrixm as an adjuvant for improving the outcomes during the development of a wide arrays of vaccines if the vaccine succeeds in the huge malaria market novavax will also benefit this growing value of development in clinical experience is validating matrixm within the industry and opening up opportunities for future collaborations and value creations … use of matrixm is expanding significantly as its becoming an increasingly valuable part of our portfolio said erck you can read more about matrix m here conclusion in case you lost count heres the total  vaccine candidates that would have sales over  billion zika older adults rsv maternal rsv and seasonal flu  other vaccine candidates ebola combination respiratory and infant rsv infant rsv would potentially also have over  billion in sales however this market is one in which its likely to face competition in comparison no other company is working on a maternal product that would protect babies in the months before theyre able to get an rsv shot its pandemic flu vaccine that is on hold pending additional governmental funding  vaccines via its joint venture in india malaria rabies and seasonal flu several vaccines by thirdparty partners including genital herpes and malaria hows that for no backups despite there being over  products this economic calendar headline claims novavaxs nasdaqnvax future hinges on the success of its zika vaccine somehow the motley fool puts forth a completely different but incorrect claim everything pretty much comes down to the prepare trial at this point if prepare misses the mark like the resolve study novavaxs hopes and dreams will effectively be dashed yes the prepare trial is an important one but the companys hopes wont be dashed if it fails as this article has extensively detailed novavax has many other arrows in its quiver that brings us to the next major area of incorrect information future funding there is so much false information being put forth on this front that a full article is needed to set it straight but in sum one major falsehood is the claim that the companys only option for funding is a heavy amount of dilution for starters it has at least three other sources of funding a partner with a larger company that pays for the trials in exchange for a cut of future profits this is fairly common for startup biotechs to do b government funding and c foundation funding also it has enough cash to last until the middle of  so theres almost no chance it will do a secondary offering until after the results of the older adults rsv trial the maternal rsv trial the seasonal flu trial and the zika trial come in so it has four opportunities for good news to propel the stock higher before doing a secondary if the stock price is high then theyre more likely to raise money through a secondary but the impact would be fairly small if the stock price is high if the stock price doesnt go high then it will probably do a above in either case it will pursue both b and c above which will reduce the amount of a needed or the size of a secondary another option is selling the company to a wellheeled company that needs to bolster its pipeline for the large pipeline above it would sell for a sizable premium over the current share price i think this option is the least likely and will probably only be pursued as a backup to the others in the next articles i will examine future funding in depth and also rebut misinformation about other aspects of the company the benefit of the misinformation is that it has created a strong buying opportunity for investors as the correct information is learned and as positive catalysts from trials come in there is a high probability that the stock will increase greatly in price in the coming weeks and months disclosure i amwe are long nvax i wrote this article
