educational michael sadler michael sadler the youngest son of james sadler was born in snelston derbyshire on rd january  his family though members of the church of england were in sympathy with the methodist movement at the age of seventeen sadler published a pamphlet an apology for the methodists  in  sadler moved to to leeds where he worked for his father in  sadler joined with his brother benjamin sadler to establish a company importing irish linen he also served as honorary treasurer of the poor rates during this period sadler became concerned about the condition of children working in local factories he argued against those who supported an unregulated society he suggested that in a society in which persons enjoyed unequal measures of economic freedom it was not true that the individual pursuit of selfinterest would necessarily lead to collective wellbeing he added that individual effort needed to be restrained and guided by the conscience of the community acting through the organisation of the state in  the duke of newcastle offered sadler the seat of newark in the house of commons elected with a majority of  votes sadler soon established himself as one of the best parliamentary speakers of the day in  sadler moved to the safer seat of aldborough pamphlets published by sadler included the state and prospects of the country  the factory girls last day  on poor laws for ireland  on ministerial plan of reform  and on the distress of the agricultural labourers  in october  sadler began his campaign to improve the condition of the agricultural labourers in britain he proposed  the erection of suitable cottages by the parish authorities  the provision of allotments large enough to feed a cow  the provision of gardens to encourage horticulture among the labourers  the provision of parish land for unemployed labourers sadler was strongly supported by john wood who owned the most successful worsted spinning business in britain wood donated £ to sadlers campaign for a tenhour bill aimed at reducing the excessive hours worked by children according to his biographer gary firth throughout  wood canvassed for sadler at westminster and that year he attended a large easter rally in york in october  wood employed the revd matthew balme as schoolmaster of a purposebuilt school adjoining his mill on th march  sadler introduced legislation that proposed limiting the hours of all persons under the age of  to ten hours a day he argued the parents rouse them in the morning and receive them tired and exhausted after the day has closed they see them droop and sicken and in many cases become cripples and die before they reach their prime and they do all this because they must otherwise starve it is a mockery to contend that these parents have a choice they choose the lesser evil and reluctantly resign their offspring to the captivity and pollution of the mill william james disagreed with michael sadlers views i have no doubt that the right honourable member michael sadler is actuated by the best intentions and motives but i think that the course which he pursues will fail in attaining the object which he has in view undoubtedly the system which is pursued in these manufactories relating to the working of young children is a great evil but it appears to me that the remedy which the honourable gentleman proposes to apply is worse than the disease there appears to me to be only a choice of evils  the children must either work or starve if the manufacturer is prevented working his mill for more than a certain number of hours together he will often be unable to execute the orders which he may receive and consequently the purchaser must go to foreign countries for a supply the result will be that you will drive the english capitalist to foreign countries where there is no restrictions upon the employment of labour and capital henry thomas hope agreed it is obvious that if you limit the hours of labour you will to nearly the same extent reduce the profits of the capital on which the labour is employed under these circumstances the manufacturers must either raise the price of the manufactured article or diminish the wages of their workmen if they raise the price of the article the foreigner gains an advantage i am informed that the foreign cottonmanufacturers and particularly the americans tread closely upon the heels of our manufacturers the right honourable member michael sadler seems to consider that it is desirable for adults to replace children i cannot concur with that opinion because i think that the labour of children is a great resource to their parents and of great benefit to themselves i therefore on the these grounds oppose this measure in the first place i doubt whether parliament can protect children as effectively as their parents secondly because i am of the opinion that a case for parliamentary interference has not yet been made out and thirdly because i believe that the bill will be productive of great inconvenience not only to persons who have embarked large capital in the cotton manufactures but even to workmen and children themselves  that i feel it my duty to oppose this measure the vast majority of the house of commons were opposed to sadlers proposal however in april  it was agreed that there should be another parliamentary enquiry into child labour sadler was made chairman and for the next three months a parliamentary committee that included john cam hobhouse charles poulett thompson robert peel lord morpeth and thomas fowell buxton interviewed  witnesses on th july michael sadler discovered that at least six of these workers had been sacked for giving evidence to the parliamentary committee sadler announced that this victimisation meant that he could no longer ask factory workers to be interviewed he now concentrated on interviewing doctors who had experience treating people who worked in textile factories sadler was one of the chief speakers at the meeting organised by richard oastler at york on th april  later that year  people assembled in fixby park near huddersfield to thank him for his work on behalf of child workers in the  general election sadlers opponent was john marshall the leeds flaxspinning magnate marshall used his considerable influence to win the election and sadler was now without a seat in the house of commons sadlers report was published in january  the information in the report shocked the british public and parliament came under increasing pressure to protect the children working in factories lord ashley son and heir of the th earl of shaftesbury agreed to take over from sadler as the leader of the factory reform movement in parliament michael sadler died in belfast on th july  primary sources

what i read i wrote to sadler offering my services in february the rev george bull asked me to take up the question that sadler had been forced to drop i can perfectly recollect my astonishment and
