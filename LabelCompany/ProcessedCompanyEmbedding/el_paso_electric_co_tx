jal new mexico el paso owned and operated one of the largest natural gas transmission systems in north america its more than  miles of pipeline connected major gas supply regions throughout the american west and mexico in the early s and supplied about seven percent of us natural gas demand in  el paso was spun off from burlington resources inc which had operated the company as a subsidiary since  paul kayser a young houston attorney founded el paso natural gas in  in  kayser obtained a franchise from the el paso city council to sell natural gas to the city he proposed construction of a mile pipeline that linked el paso with natural gas wells located near the city of jal new mexico after obtaining financing for the ambitious project he immediately began hiring work crews and securing equipment and supplies pipeline construction methods at the time were crude in comparison to techniques developed during the mids the lines were built by hand and the men who worked on the lines had to be extremely tough difficulties related to building kaysers pipeline were amplified by the fact that his pipes would cross some of the most difficult terrain in the southwestern united states the pipeline had to cross  miles of rivers mountains and deserts and it had to be built to withstand all types of natural disasters although the work was tedious and timeconsuming kaysers crews pioneered new methods of welding ditching and crossing unique terrain the line was finished and put into service in  unfortunately for kayser and his fledgling startup the great depression began shortly after the building of the pipeline el paso generated profits of  during the pipelines first year of operation but the depressionera economy threatened to quash the venture fortunately the city of el paso
