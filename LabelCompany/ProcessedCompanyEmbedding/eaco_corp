is often described as a white or ivory chalklike deposit efflorescence is formed by water migrating through the masonry wall and out the pores as it passes through the wall it collects loose salt and lime and brings them to the surface as the water evaporates the salt or lime particles bond to the wall causing white stains several products can be used to remove efflorescence nmd  at a  dilution when using nmd  for post construction cleaning removing mortar smears nmd  will not cause cleanup efflorescence effortless undiluted is formulated for one purpose which is to remove efflorescence calcium chloride effortless is a soap solution that counteracts efflorescence not every white stain on a wall is efflorescence calcite calcium carbonate will appear as a thick whitish deposit that usually forms over time calcite most commonly forms when excess moisture passes through the mortar joints evaporating leaving behind white deposits on brick â for removing calcite use calcite presoak followed with nmd  lime run calcium hydroxide occurs as a steady release of calcium soaked water that creates a streak generally lime run is treated just like calcite when it is caught early enough the normal wash process of nmd   will be effective enough to remove it for removing lime run the same procedure is used as removing calcite use calcite presoak followed with nmd  white scum calcium silicate is a result from improper use of new masonry cleaner reacting with brick and forming insoluble salts this is created by unbuffered acid combining with silicates and clay for removing white scum use white scum presoak followed with nmd   integral water repellent can sometimes bleed out of the brick or block leaving behind a white haze that has very similar appearance to efflorescence or white scum however the removal process is completely different for removing use onerestore undiluted admixtures in mortar can bleed out leaving a white stain that can appear above and below the mortar joints it looks similar to calcite and lime run for removal use onerestore followed with nmd  sealers applied incorrectly or failing can look white too knowing the type of sealer is helpful to find the correct remover not knowing the type of sealer a variety of products needs to be tested to find the correct remover as you can see by the pictures below not all white stains are the same while some of them appear to be very similar a simple test with water will help you determine if you have efflorescence or another variety of white stain simply spray water on an affected area if the stain disappears when wet and reappears when dry it might be efflorescence if the stain is still visible it may not be efflorescence product specification sheets must be read for the details on ‘’how to use” always test prior to beginning full scale cleaning operations testing should confirm cleaning effectiveness on each type of surface and stain designated to be removed also test to deâ­termine the desired surface contact time and any potential for adverse reactions with adjacent materials allow test panels to dry thoroughly before evaluating final appearance and results is it efflorescence
