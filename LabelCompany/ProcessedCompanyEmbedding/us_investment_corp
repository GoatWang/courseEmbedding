coins a for investment quality coins the effect of bullion price movements is minimal if any these coins have value due to their rarity and collector demand rather than any intrinsic metal content for example in the art world the value of a picasso is not based on how much paint wood or canvas is used to create the work the same is true with rare coins an investor who buys a  gold piece for  is not concerned that the coin contains about an ounce of gold currently worth  in lower quality coins those that are of poor condition and easily obtained the price is determined largely by bullion price

in rare coins a like any other investment rare coins are cyclical in nature they go up and down in value based on economic conditions market supply and demand in the past these cycles occurred every

portfolio to accomplish the key steps include identifying specific financial goals these may include funding a child’s higher education your own retirement the purchase of a home starting a business or other goals that are important to you assessing the amount of time you have to achieve each goal setting time frames for each of your goals is key because it can help determine how long your money can keep working for you understanding your own risk tolerance some investors are risk takers by nature while others are very conservative but many fall somewhere in between age personality investment experience and financial circumstance can all affect your tolerance for risk determining your asset allocation – in other words the mix of assets you want to own across various classes of investments diversification may help reduce your overall risk your asset allocation strategy should support your goals while being consistent with your risk tolerance level taking the time to review your overall portfolio performance keeping your eye on the big picture if your portfolio begins to drift from your asset allocation strategy you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your longterm investment strategy making adjustments to your portfolio if your needs and circumstances change why do i need to diversify my portfolioa diversified portfolio spreads investment dollars out over a variety of asset classes andor different securities the goal of diversification is to help protect the value of your overall portfolio against a decline of price in a single security andor a market sector for example some investors own a mix of stocks and bonds with the expectation that in times when stock markets decline bonds will perform better helping to minimize the volatility of the overall portfolio the different asset classes may counterbalance one another to help reduce shortterm fluctuation in the portfolio of course asset allocation and diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a losswhy is it important to focus on asset allocation as part of the investment processstudies show that asset allocation has the single largest impact on your account’s overall performance according to  nobel prize winner harry markowitz’s “modern portfolio theory” almost  of investment returns are the result of how assets are allocated among different classes while only  are due to the specific stocks and bonds you choose to buy within each asset class asset allocation may have a more significant affect on performance returns than industry weighting stock selection market timing or any other portfolio management decisionhow often should i make adjustments to my asset allocationyour asset allocation should reflect your current investment objectives but it is also a longterm commitment if your objectives and investment timeframe have not changed you may not want to make adjustments to your asset mix this is true even if shortterm developments in the market are not working to your benefit but if things have changed the investment mix that suited you when you began investing may not be appropriate today major changes in your personal life financial situation and time horizon can all be reasons to reconsider your asset allocation strategywhat does it mean to rebalance a portfolio and why is that importantyour asset allocation strategy is based on specific objectives for investment return consistent with your acceptable level of risk if over time the performance of certain types of assets held in your portfolio dramatically stray from expected return levels it’s possible that you may find that you are significantly overinvested or underinvested in specific asset classes for example if due to strong performance a planned  weighting of international stocks in your portfolio grows to a  weighting you may suddenly be taking on significantly more risk by owning more international stocks than your original allocation called for if that occurs you may consider rebalancing assets in your portfolio to the weighting specified in your original asset allocation strategyis there a cost to having my investments professionally managedyes your advisor will discuss the costs involved before you decide to become a clientwhat products are available within these managed accountsdepending on your specific situation portfolios may include
