levy tmfncaffeine feb   at pm facebooks new product ads might soon show up in your news feed source facebook if youre a frequent online shopper get ready to see a few more interesting ads in your facebook nasdaqfb news feed last week facebook started experimenting with product ads which help businesses advertise a range of products across all devices and tailor the featured products to the viewers activity and interests the first retailers to test the new dynamic ad format are target and shutterfly these ads will compete for ad dollars with googles nasdaqgoogl nasdaqgoog shopping ads previously product listing ads which the company launched in  google has had quite a bit of success with its shopping ads which show up when someone searches for the product successfully moving retailers from textbased ads to the higherpriced graphic ads now facebook represents a serious threat to googles growing business retailers love shopping adsshopping ads have quickly grown into an important revenue generator for google in the fourth quarter  of paid clicks for retailrelated searches were for shopping ads according to adobes digital index adobe also found that spending on shopping ads increased  year over year moreover retailers spent  less on google text ads as a result of declining cost per click and a shift to shopping ads by the end of  adobe predicts shopping ads will account for  of all search ad dollars for google facebook sees no reason it cant copy googles success retailers had already been piecing together their own product ads but the makeshift versions retailers created had limited targeting capabilities facebook is lending retailers a hand by helping them create dynamic ads that can retarget advertisements across devices the dynamic ads will show products based on users browsing habits across the web and mobile apps facebooks targeting capabilities are superior to googles and the company is able to use technology from atlas  its new demandside ad platform  to retarget ads across devices and gather data from mobile app and web browsing google remains one step behind in that regard but its less about targeting than keywordbased advertising in effect neither google nor facebook can claim a better product for some companies googles shopping ads will work better and for others facebooks product ads will work better but in order to find out retailers will have to try both therefore ad budgets likely will slowly shift to facebook from google what about those buy buttons facebooks buy button source facebook both google and facebook have been experimenting with buy buttons to allow retailers to complete transactions without forcing users to leave the page buy buttons naturally complement shopping and product ads and represent an incremental revenue opportunity for both companies facebook seems to be ahead of google in that regard experimenting with a small public rollout last summer google has yet to run any public experiments with a buy button if facebook couples a buy button with its new product ads it could boost conversions for retailers that could cause more ad dollars to flow facebooks way instead of to google what does this all mean for facebook investorsfacebook has consistently lowered its ad supply as more users shift to mobile the effect has been a rapid increase in average ad prices if facebook wants to continue that momentum it needs more premium ad products product ads certainly fit the bill as they offer superior targeting retargeting and tracking to the makeshift versions retailers have been using facebook can build on top of product ads still by adding the buy button as mentioned or offering retailers the ability to use video both of those would increase the price of an ad with ad impressions falling  in the fourth quarter due partly to actions taken by facebook and due partly to things outside of its control facebook needs to continue increasing ad prices to grow revenue adam
