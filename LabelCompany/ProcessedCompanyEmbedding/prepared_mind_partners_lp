adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our offtake pricing to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton

retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain other items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing

partners first quarter  earnings results conference call todays call is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to mike mears chief executive officer please go ahead michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss magellans first quarter financial results before we get started ill remind you that management will be making forwardlooking statements as defined by the sec such statements are based on our current judgments regarding the factors that could impact the future performance of magellan you should review the risk factors and other information discussed in our filings with the sec and form your own opinions about magellans future performance as you probably saw this morning magellan reported solid earnings for the first quarter of  these results exceeded our previous guidance with each of our operating segments generating higher financial results than the yearago period our cfo aaron milford will review magellans first quarter financial results in more detail then ill back to discuss our guidance for the year and review the status of some of our larger expansion projects before opening the call to your questions aaron aaron l milford  magellan midstream partners lp thank you mike in my comments today i will be making references to certain nongaap financial metrics including operating margin and distributable cash flow weve included exhibits to our earnings release that reconcile these metrics to their nearest gaap measure earlier this morning we reported first quarter net income of  million or  per unit on a diluted basis which was higher than the  million or  per diluted unit reported for the first quarter of  excluding the impact of marktomarket futures contract activity in the current quarter adjusted diluted earnings per unit of  exceeded our guidance of  provided back in february distributable cash flow was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million reported in the first quarter of  overall were off to a good start for  with all of our business segments showing improved operating margin performance compared to last years quarter i will now move to a brief discussion of the operating margin performance for each of our business segments our refined products segment generated  million of operating margin in the first quarter of  compared to  million for the same period of  this  million increase from the first quarter of  is primarily the result of  million of out of period marktomarket adjustments related to our commodity hedging activities segment feebased activities also demonstrated growth over the previous years quarter transportation and terminals revenues increased  million compared to the  quarter this increase was driven by higher revenues from our little rock pipeline which came into service in july of  as well as  higher demand for refined products including both gasoline and diesel in our markets excluding little rock as well as  higher average tariffs as a result of our mid tariff adjustment operating expenses increased  million compared to the first quarter of  as a result of timing of maintenance costs as well as costs associated with the operation of the little rock pipeline these increased costs were partially offset by higher product overages for the quarter as mentioned a moment ago product margin increased by  million compared to the first quarter of  as a result of out of period unrealized gains associated with our hedging program when we evaluate our cash margin which takes into account when we physically sell product and normalizes for these unrealized gains and losses the current quarters cash margin performance was essentially flat between periods for our crude oil segment operating margin of  million was  million higher than the first quarter of last year revenue increased  million mostly due to new contracts at our east houston terminal and higher transportation revenue from our houston distribution system volumes associated with our houston distribution system were down compared to the  quarter but higher average rates due to deficiency in revenues recognized in the current period resulted in higher realized tariff that more than offset the decline in revenuegenerating volume segment operating expenses increased  million as a result of slightly higher integrity expenses and lower product gains compared to the previous years quarter for the quarter volumes in our longhorn pipeline averaged approximately  barrels per day consistent with last years quarter and slightly higher than our fullyear guidance of  barrels per day equity earnings from our various joint ventures were  million higher than the first quarter of  this increase primarily resulted from contributions from saddlehorn which came online in september of last year and averaged approximately  barrels per day in the first quarter of  which is consistent with its minimum volume commitment bridgetex volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day during the first quarter of  which is similar to the comparable  quarter and also consistent with its minimum volume commitments finishing up my discussion of our segment performance our marine segment generated  million of operating margin in the current quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of  revenues were higher as a result of higher overall customer activity and additional capacity at our corpus christi terminal operating expenses were favorable compared to last years quarter as a result of more favorable product overages in the current period now moving to other net income variances to last years quarter our ga expenses were essentially flat compared to the  period and our depreciation and amortization expense was up by  million as result of assets being placed into service our net interest expense increased by  million due to a slightly higher weighted average interest rate of  a higher weighted average debt balance of  billion as well as lower capitalized interest related to capital spending in the current quarter other income items decreased compared to the previous year due to last years quarter benefiting from the  million noncash gain resulting from the transfer of our osage pipe line equity interest to holly corporation as well as the current quarter being negatively impacted by noncash changes in value of certain hedge positions related to our tank bottom inventory as well as higher pension settlement expenses i will now move to a discussion regarding our balance sheet and liquidity position as mentioned earlier our longterm debt balance was  billion as of march  of this year which included  million of commercial paper our leverage ratio was approximately  times we continue to maintain credit facilities totaling  billion with  billion as a backstop to our commercial paper program and other than a de minimis amount for letters of credit outstanding the facilities remain undrawn as discussed in past calls we continue to make progress in establishing an atthemarket equity program to use as another tool for funding future growth but with current leverage at approximately  times we do not anticipate using this program immediately once formally established this program will essentially help us manage our leverage in a manner that is consistent with our  times targeted maximum leverage ratio as we continue to make investments and grow i will now turn the call back over to mike to discuss our guidance for the balance of the year as well as our significant growth projects michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp thanks aaron as part of our earnings release this morning we reaffirmed our  dcf guidance of  billion which you may recall was in line with our original guidance for the year since that time we have resolved the contractual issue with our condensate splitter and now expect to commence commercial operations during the late second quarter however this is somewhat offset by the contraction of the forward gasoline price curve which would result in lower profits from our commodityrelated activities we usually begin hedging fall activity around this time to coincide with the traditional seasonal decline in butane pricing since the majority of our fall blending volumes have not yet been hedged our forecast for butane blending income for the rest of the year closely tracks the current pricing curves so while there have been a number of pluses and minuses we still believe our earlier guidance remains reasonable at this point and as a reminder dcf guidance of  billion would represent a record year for magellan with distribution growth of  and a healthy coverage ratio of  times moving to expansion projects magellan recently achieved a number of important milestones mainly related to our joint venture projects during march we commenced operations of our powder springs butane blending joint venture with colonial pipeline and also the carr extension of the saddlehorn pipeline further phase i of seabrook logistics is now operational and accepting crude oil imports under longterm commitment as a reminder phase ii of seabrook logistics is currently under construction with a mid expected completion date once phase ii is complete seabrook logistics will be connected to our houston area crude oil distribution system and will accommodate crude oil and condensate exports as well as providing a broader range of crude oil import delivery options theres also been a lot of recent activity surrounding the bridgetex pipeline which we own jointly with plains we recently started operations at our new bryan texas origin to accept eaglebine barrels into the system as you may recall we also announced plans to expand the capacity of bridgetex from  barrels a day to  barrels per day and that incremental capacity is expected to be operational by the end of the second quarter in addition we are currently evaluating a further expansion of bridgetex up to its maximum capacity of  barrels a day which we believe could be achieved by the construction of additional pumping capacity our latest growth spending estimates are now  million in  and  million in  to complete the construction projects currently underway these spending estimates are  million higher than the last guidance we provided due to the launch of new projects primarily related to the construction of  million barrels of crude oil storage at our east houston terminal and as previously announced an additional  barrels of storage to support our corpus christi condensate splitter and as weve stated in the past we do not anticipate the need to issue equity in the near future to finance the growth projects currently underway due to magellans solid balance sheet and low leverage ratio we continue to evaluate well in excess of  million of other potential organic growth opportunities weve been discussing a few of these potential projects with you such as further expansion phases at our pasadena terminal and additional buildout of our seabrooks logistics joint venture in addition we are currently assessing the results of a recent refined products open season to determine if sufficient interest exists to expand our refined products pipeline from houston to dallas texas and like a number of other players in the industry we are also evaluating a new pipeline to transport crude oil and condensate from the permian basin to corpus christi active discussions are progressing for each of these potential projects but as a reminder these opportunities can take considerable time to negotiate based on their size and complexity especially in light of the current dynamic market we will provide further details as it becomes clear that these projects are moving forward and of course we remain active in evaluating potential acquisitions in the past weve discussed our desire to extend our value chain to include gathering assets that could direct barrels to our longhaul pipelines in the permian basin and that interest remains there have been a number of assets marketed recently which we believe were attractive assets towards accomplishing this goal we have analyzed and valued these assets at terms that we believe are reasonable and in the best longterm interest of magellans investors we have not been able to execute on this acquisition opportunities since the market clearing valuations have been higher than we are comfortable with our preferred growth strategy continues to be construction of new assets which generally provides better returns in saying that we do believe acquisitions can be an important element of growth and we will continue to search for acquisition opportunities that fit our company well while maintaining our disciplined approach to acquire the right assets at a price we believe makes sense and that concludes our prepared remarks so operator well now turn it over for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from theresa chen from barclays theresa chen  barclays capital inc hi my first question is related to your comment about potentially constructing a crude line from the permian to corpus christi can you talk about how you view your competitive positioning versus other midstream players who have indicated interest and some have substantial downstream assets at corpus one as you alluded to just acquired upstream gathering assets how do you think magellan will win this project michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i wont talk about the competition too much it is clear that there are a number of parties both that have announced their intent and perhaps some that havent announced their intents that are evaluating a pipeline to corpus i think its fair to say that not all of those pipelines will be necessary we feel like weve got a good competitive position to start with we also have a strong position asset position in the corpus christi market we have a large marine facility there with significant expansion capability we are operating a condensate splitter at our facility that is a demand point for product moving in into the market so we think were just as well positioned in the corpus christi market as others and our business model and the way we are proposing to operate this pipeline we think is attractive to the market im not going to sit here and say that its clearcut that we are the most likely winner of this but we think we have a very good and realistic shot of providing a competitive offering to the market at the end of the day the winners in this – on this opportunity are going to be those parties that can secure the commitments necessary to make it happen and we are as we expect all of our competition are talking to all of these parties as we speak and it is going to evolve over time i really dont have much more to say on that other than we think weve got a reasonable shot at this and well keep you informed theresa chen  barclays capital inc thank you and a broader followup question to that there has been a lot of discussion on where the optimal destination is for additional permian barrels in terms of export option from the gulf coast houston versus corpus for example since you have a footprint in both areas would you care to share your view on this michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i think the focus is now on corpus primarily because a significant portion of the growth in the permian basin is expected to be very light crude oil and very light and – very light crude oil and the condensate particularly coming out of the delaware basin really are not well designed for the houston refined market theyre more likely to be split at a condensate splitter or put on the water for export so if thats the primary focus of increased production – im not saying thats all of their production growth in the basin and theres still going to be production growth that wants to go to houston but theres significant pipeline capacity at houston theres significant – and i shouldnt say just houston i mean that the eastern gulf coast market there is significant available capacity on many of those pipes that are there today but corpus christi doesnt have the same pipeline infrastructure headed to it and of a significant portion of this growth is going to be barrels that really dont have an interest to the houston area refiners and it has a primary interest to be exported thats whats going to drive these barrels to corpus christi so thats why we and all the other players are focused on corpus as the next destination for a pipeline theresa chen  barclays capital inc got it and just one last housekeeping question from me what was your total capex spend for the quarter michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp our maintenance capital is right around  million our expansion capital aaron l milford  magellan midstream partners lp for the first quarter total spend – payout capital  million maintenance capital  million theresa chen  barclays capital inc thank you very much operator and next well go to brian zarahn from mizuho brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc good afternoon michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp hi brian brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc i guess circling back on your proposed permiancorpus pipe i mean would you entertain jv – obviously of other jv and the permian and outside of the permian how does that scenario fit into your planning michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i wont call that too much on our plans i mean we – clearly weve been willing to do jvs in the past we did that on bridgetex we did that on saddlehorn id say if the situation was right that would be something we would consider but i dont really want to talk about the specifics around this pipe brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc and then i guess going back to bridgetex can you talk a little bit about the additional expansion youre considering potential costs and then how do you think about contracts going forward for bridgetex are you comfortable with the spot volumes michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well on bridgetex i mean if you recall the expansion from  to  it was a very low capital expansion singledigits millions of dollars so that was something we were willing to do without any form of commitment to go from  to  will be more expensive than that since well have to add incremental pump stations its likely and im not going to say that its a final decision but its likely that we would be looking for contracts to underwrite that expansion if we were to do it so its a little bit different than the one we just did brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc and then does dragreducing agent play a role as an option or you would look for pump stations for the – to get the  michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp dragreducing agents factored into all the evaluations to get to  were going to be using quite a bit of drag reducer brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc okay michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp but no we cannot get from  to  with just drag reducer we have to add incremental pump stations brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc and then on the splitter it looks like the economics are roughly the same i mean anything worth noting in terms of the new contract for the corpus splitter michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i dont know that id characterize the contracts as roughly the same i mean it is – i would characterize it as marginally less attractive than the original contract from a pure financial perspective if youll recall we had initially talked about the splitter as being a six times multiple over the extended life of the contract if it was renewed that the early years would be better than that and the later years would be worse than that if we were to make that same assumption today its close to an eight times multiple so its still a very attractive investment but from a pure financial standpoint its a little less attractive however there are number of operational changes that were made to the contract that are very beneficial to us and im not going to go into detail on those but it was kind of a package deal on the renegotiation brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc from my understanding the timing has changed a bit in terms of the economics but on average it was one turn higher on the multiple what about contract length michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp its still a longterm contract but i dont want to comment on it any further than that and as weve said before a longterm contract to us means five years or longer brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc okay and last one from me going to saddlehorn understanding you have contracts with two large producers but were seeing some concern over potential ramifications of the explosion that took place in colorado and maybe some regulatory action could those contracts be adjusted for unforeseen regulatory action michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp i dont have the contracts in front of me i would – normally they do not i cant really speak to those contracts as i dont have in front of me but i would think normally they do not brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc thanks mike michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp so the short answer is i dont know what we actually have in that contract id have to go back and read it brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc understood thank you operator and moving on our next question is from shneur gershuni from ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hi good afternoon guys i was wondering if we can sort of talk about sort of the landscape of the permian and kind of your decisions to not secure gathering assets and i recognize youre saying the prices are too high but when i sort of think about it in context of your existing pipelines going to houston you just mentioned earlier to a previous questioner about light barrels and it makes more sense for it to go to corpus doesnt it make controlling some of the gathering critical especially when you got a contract rolling on longhorn i believe it is in a year or two i was just sort of kind of wondering if you can sort of talk about that and do you sort of loosen up on what you think the expected – or multiple youre willing to pay for just given the multiple impacts it has downstream michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i mean first i would say and i would characterize it a little differently i mean weve said that were interested in growing in the gathering business and the recent few months it hasnt been our decision not to its just been – its been much more expensive than were willing to pay and i would characterize our interest in being more of a nicetohave than critical we believe and our customers i think would agree with us that we provide a viable desired transportation service from the permian to houston and that the producers at the end of the day will – the large producers in particular will drive where those barrels go no matter who owns the gathering system and if the gathering systems that are in place wont accommodate that then the large producers will likely figure out a way to make it happen so were – now i wont concede that owning a gathering system makes that a lot more efficient but we dont think its critical we dont think it destroys the value proposition of our pipes that we dont have it when we talk about valuations of gathering systems youve kind of in a – theres two ways to look at it the real value of a gathering system is if you are in a situation where youve got significant excess capacity pipeline take – excess capacity which would imply that production growth is not as robust as forecast and if thats your scenario then you certainly dont want to pay a premium for a gathering system based on current production forecast because in those situations youve really overpaid for it and you bought an insurance policy at a price thats excessive because the production growth isnt there if you look at the flipside of that where the production forecasts are strong and they actually transpire that way which i think is what most peoples belief is today then that would warrant paying a premium for a gathering system but it also lessens the need to have  insurance policy for your takeaway pipe because theres going to be enough production to fill your pipe up anyway so when you balance those two things you want to put a reasonable price risk adjusted on a gathering system and thats the way we have approached it we havent approached it as its critical and we have to have it at all costs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc right no that makes total sense just shifting over to – in your prepared remarks you talked about establishing an atthemoney market or atm program what kind of capex profile would there have to be in i guess late  or  that you would then need to tap the atm or i guess said differently what would the capex budget need to be next year that you would be forced to use the atm or whats that line where you use it or dont use it michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp i dont have a number to give you but here is why were doing it i mean if you look at our current spending it would suggest that we dont need to do this but as i mentioned we are looking at significant expansion of our pasadena terminal which could be anywhere from  million to  billion of capital opportunity were looking to expanding our seabrooks logistics terminal were looking at building a new pipe to dallas refined products were looking to build a new crude oil pipe to corpus out of the permian if all of those things happen or even half of those things happen its unlikely that we will want to – that we could finance that all the debt and stay below  times debttoebitda ratio and so we wanted to be prepared if those happen to fund with equity if needed and thats why were putting the program in place shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc right i was just trying to figure out what that number was like was it  billion or  billion and so forth so that makes perfect sense and then finally when does the recontracting discussions began for longhorn is it something that happens a couple months in advance of the exploration or is that something that you sort of have kind of ongoing and we could hear about extensions more than a year in advance michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp theyre ongoing i dont know that anything would be finalized until right before they expire but those discussions are taking place now and have been taking place shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc all right perfect thank you very much guys appreciate the color michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp sure operator well go next to kristina kazarian from deutsche bank kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc afternoon guys michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp hi kristina kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc two quick clarification one i – just in case i missed it i dont think i did but just in case could you guys mention what the proposed capacity could potentially be on the crude pipe to corpus michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp we have not i mean thats all subject to the negotiations and discussions were in with potential shippers kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc and you didnt say either what the cost associated with the  extension on bridgetex was did you michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp we didnt we didnt kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc okay its not like the – if i was thinking the previous  barrel a day extension with the low singledigit number it would be more than that though correct michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp it would be more than that we would have to put in pump stations and so itd be more than that yes but we have – were not ready to disclose that quite yet kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc no no its fair ill go big picture now and a bit more strategic increased importance of exports coming off in a lot of the energy earnings call so far so maybe could you touch on what you kind of would need to see to move forward on either the pasadena or the seabrooks terminal expansion projects and just how youre thinking generally about that timeframe was michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well on seabrook i mean were focused on the phase ii construction which once its complete were going to have significant export capability at that point in time further expansion of that i think its probably unlikely that were going to launch that until we get phase ii into service and we see what the utilization is and what the – and where the market is at that time so that would be my expectation i mean there is a chance it could go quicker than that i mean were having discussions with interested parties on using the facility and if we reach some sort of tipping point where we think – even before its up and running its going to be full then we would evaluate the next phase of expansion or approving the next phase states of expansion at that point but were not quite at that point yet on pasadena the interest is there today i mean its just a matter of negotiations with counterparties which were doing and getting the commitments to build the next phases and so were not waiting for anything there were negotiating those opportunities as we speak kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc and then when were thinking about pasadena you kind of gave a bigger range in response to one of the other questions i think you said  million to  billion there in terms of how much the next set of opportunities could be can you just help me bound range that like thought wise like – what does that mean in terms of how much we expand when im thinking about like – about the lower end versus the upper end michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp from a capital standpoint kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc no from a like volume like whats the difference like is there a smaller segment of the expansion is there a larger – like what are you kind of visioning in your head there michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well we – yeah we have been – with regards to pasadena i mean our business model there which is subject to change but what it is right now is to bring in three or four large interested parties and then provide dedicated docks for those parties thats kind of how weve been marketing that the first phase you would have a customer in there who is taking – im trying to remember the storage there its  million barrels of storage and a dedicated dock the footprint there can handle  million barrels of storage and up to five docks so those would be the incremental expansions it is additional storage and an additional dock and those will likely happen in increment as we sign individual customers to support that and just from a ballpark standpoint i mean its increment can be a wide range but its probably  million to  million range for each individual increment depending on how much storage someone is interested in kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc great thank you guys michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp sure operator our next question is from john edwards from credit suisse john edwards  credit suisse group yeah good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my question just coming back to the issue of the gathering systems and the interest there and you were mentioning that the systems youd looked at it just was – with the market clearing price was higher than youre willing to go i guess what im curious about are there still the gathering systems remaining that are presumably on the market that are still of interest to you and what do you think the prospects would be of succeeding with some of those if you can comment anyway in that regard michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well i will say i mean its no secret i think that there are still private equity backed gathering systems that exist when and if theyll come to the market i cant tell you how competitive well be again i cant tell you on that either i mean we will be interested if there is something that comes to market that fits well with our strategy probably the only answer i can tell you john edwards  credit suisse group okay so there is no private equity backed systems currently on the market today michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp i probably should defer on answering that question i mean typically whether there is or there isnt typically if there is one we would have signed a ca that says we cant talk about it anyway so probably should defer on that question john edwards  credit suisse group okay all right fair enough all right i was just curious if you saw any other gathering systems that would be what youve envisioned as a potential opportunity for you michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp there are there are but that doesnt mean that theyre going to come to the market and that doesnt mean that were going to win the bid but there are other assets out there that wed be interested in john edwards  credit suisse group okay thank you and then just following up on some of brians questions on the renegotiation of the arrangement with the splitter so i was just curious so you said basically the multiple from being around six has slipped a little bit to around eight and maybe i missed it but it sounded as if there wasnt really any financial compensation involved in that tradeoff but it was more surrounding the duration that kind of thing because you were in litigation there and then you reached an arrangement you settled it so im just sort of curious did you get anything out of that discussion that sort of kept you whole if you will michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well we did get the things out of the negotiations obviously or we wouldnt have done it i mean i think notably we got much more clarity on the contract i mean i think its fair to say our dispute had to do with some difference of opinion on certain terms in the agreement so we got clarity on that and we also changed some of the operational terms of the agreement that were beneficial to us john edwards  credit suisse group okay but in terms of a financial upside is there an opportunity then to return to that approximately six times multiple or is it just going to settle out here at a little bit lower multiple michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp i think you should assume its just going to settle at a lower multiple john edwards  credit suisse group okay okay great thank you thats it for me operator i have another question that comes from lin shen from hite lin shen  hite hedge asset management llc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question mike can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing for the price curve of gasoline and also butane to make you feel that you may see some margin contraction for this year michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp well when were doing our forecast typically especially this time of year we will – i mean we look at what we have hedged and we look at what the current – for whats unhedged we just look at the current forward price curve for gasoline into the fall when we do the actual blending from the current curve for butane and in many cases we look at the prompt price of butane because thats the way we typically operate if we see an attractive margin wed buy the butane now and hedge gasoline so at this point in time we have a small portion of our fall blending hedged historically thats not uncommon the last two years weve been more hedged at this point because if you remember the last two years we kind of had big bumps in crude oil price – and its all relative – in gasoline prices late in the first quarter and so we took advantage of that but historically its not unusual for us to go to this time of year unhedged because historically the bottom of the seasonal butane pricing curve is the next few months as we go into the driving season as we go into the low rvp season and theres an excess of butane because of the low rvp gasoline so the situation were in now with regards to not being hedged is not unusual but the margins obviously are driven by what the forward price curve of gasoline looks like and those are not particularly strong right now compared to where they have been in the past few years and so thats what were exposed to i would anticipate that we will start hedging for the fall here in the next couple months and as everyone knows the price curve can change dramatically at any point in time and so as we start to lock those in well have a more certainty around what thats going to be so – and i hope that answers your question but if not lin shen  hite hedge asset management llc great thank you michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp okay lin shen  hite hedge asset management llc thats fine thank you thank you great operator our next question comes from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp hi jeremy jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc hi i was just wondering if you could comment on marine storage rates any renewals you might have as far as the market structure impacting what youre seeing any color would be great michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp i assume you mean on refined products and we – i mean the refined products renewal rates are very strong right now the market structure – with regards to marine storage the market structure is less important than access to the water and really the optionality is in multiple markets so i mean currently its pretty strong right now jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks so thats it from me operator we have a followup question from shneur gershuni from ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hey guys just a quick followup question on lins question about gasoline and kind of your expectations is the issue just the curve is just not right there right now or is it more of a function of where the product is going weve been seeing movements from pad two to pad one in terms of gasoline with some infrastructure thats been built product been going out of mexico and so forth i mean is there potentially a permanent shift that we may be starting to see the early signals on michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp no i think were talking about two different things here i mean the kind of shift youre talking about can affect the basis shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc yeah michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp differentials in the gulf coast and the midcontinent where we sell our gasoline thats not what i was talking about earlier i mean that does affect our margins and that basis can be seasonal we really havent seen anything right now that would suggest there has been a big permanent shift in that and so i mean theres a lot of dynamics related there i mean youve got – sure youve got access to more exports coming from gulf coast refiners but youre – i mean were also creating new markets for midcontinent refiners such as little rock and  texas that somewhat mitigates that also so thats not what i was talking about what i was talking about was just the nymex curve i mean start with that and then you have a basis differential i think your question of basis differential is good one but were not seeing what we think is a permanent shift there i mean right now we do have kind of softness in the midcontinent due to large inventories but we dont think that thats structural change and so no my previous comments were really just the nymex forward price versus the prompt price on butane shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay that makes perfect sense thank you operator and thats all the time we have for questions today speakers ill turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks michael n mears  magellan midstream partners lp all right well thank you for your time today we appreciate your interest in magellan and have a good day operator and that does conclude our conference thank you for your participation you

top  stocks in sure dividend newsletter nowget the  yield sure retirement newsletter now hoegh lng partners lp smallcap mlp priced for doubledigit total returns published by nick mccullum on july th  when investors think about investing in master limited partnerships the first subsector that likely comes to mind is midstream energy companies – operators of pipelines and storage vessels what investors likely don’t think of is marinebased vessel transportation partnerships there is a reason for this it is a relatively small market with one mlp holding a dominant leadership position that mlp is hoegh lng partners lp hmlp which trades on the new york stock exchange and has a market capitalization of  million what immediately stands out about this partnership is its exceptionally high dividend yield hoegh lng partners currently trades with a yield of   more than x the average yield in the sp  hoegh lng partners is one of a short list of stocks with  dividend yields ideal for investors looking to generate meaningful portfolio income you can see the full list of all  stocks with  dividend yields here hoegh lng partners also has other appealing characteristics as an mlp the company’s distributions are highly taxefficient in fact master limited partnerships are the most effective investment vehicle for generating aftertax income primarily because they avoid paying tax at the organizational level you can see the full list of all  mlps here hoegh lng partners’ high dividend yield and tax efficiency make it an appealing investment for investors looking to synthesize a passive income stream from their nest egg this article will analyze the investment prospects of hoegh lng partners in detail business overview hoegh lng partners is a publiclytraded master limited partnership that provides floating marinebased liquid natural gas lng transportation services under longterm contracts the partnership owns and operates five floating storage and regasification units fsrus which act as floating import terminals hoegh lng partners is the only pure play fsru company in the public markets and owns the most modern fsru fleet hoegh’s general partner is hoegh lng holdings ltd hlng which is domiciled in bermuda in addition to its general partner interest hoegh lng holdings owns a  limited partner stake in hoegh lng partners this significant alignment of interest is beneficial for all parties involved and should be noted by hoegh’s investors source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  from an investment perspective hoegh lng partners is attractive from a number of angles it is the only publicly listed fsru pure play in the market which gives it a leadership position in its industry further the partnership’s revenues are generated under longterm contracts with a weighted average term of  years hoegh lng partners’ earliest contract renewal occurs in  and the partnership has no nearterm debt maturities giving it a measure of recession resistance in the shortterm more details about the hoegh lng partners investment thesis can be seen below source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  hoegh lng partners benefits from the advantages that come with operating fsrus fsrus are faster and more cost effective infrastructure assets for important liquid natural gas these transportation vehicles move energy products at half the time and half the cost of landbased transportation terminals with a much more limited environment impact since they float they can be easily transported and removed once their useful life has terminated source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  presently hoegh lng partners owns  fsrus neptune gdf suez cape ann pgn fsru lampung hoegh gallant hoegh grace note that hoegh lng partners does not own  of each fsru some of these vessels also have a part ownership from the mlp’s general partner fsruspecific details about each marine vessel can be seen in the following diagram source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  with only  marine assets one might think that hoegh lng parters operates within a fairly limited geographic region surprisingly this is not the case along with the company’s significant fsru presence it serves smaller markets by barges and other marine vessels the end effect of this strategy is to have significant geographic diversification serving each continent except for surprisingly north america hoegh lng partners’ full geographic footprint can be seen below source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  growth prospects hoegh lng partners’ growth will be primarily driven by its sizeable revenue backlog in fact the company has a revenue backlog of  billion certainly more than it can handle in the immediate future remember that this is an mlp with a market cap of less than  million – so a  billion revenue backlog is substantial the partnership’s backlog is welldiversified by counterparty and  of the backlog counterparties operate in investment grade countries – an important risk mitigant for a geographically diverse enterprise such as hoegh lng partners source hoegh lng partners first quarter earnings presentation slide  hoegh lng partners will also benefit from the rising supply and demand for liquid natural gas as an energy source in fact it is estimated that lng supply will exceed demand keeping lng prices reasonable and allowing for continued growth in transportation volumes – the source of revenue for hoegh lng partners source hoegh lng partners first quarter earnings presentation slide  all said hoegh lng partners’ impressive backlog and the tailwind from the rising popularity of liquid natural gas will drive this mlp’s growth for the foreseeable future competitive advantage  recession performance hoegh lng partners’ main competitive advantage comes from its leadership in the frsu market and its strong relationships with large players in the world’s largest energy markets the company also benefits from its attractive revenue stream hoegh lng partners’ revenue is generated under longterm contract agreements this minimizes the risk of a revenue decline in a recession since hoegh’s counterparties are legally obliged to pay for their contracted services hoegh lng partners’ five wholly or part owned fsrus are contracted through at least  while many have an option to be used for much longer than that the partnership has an average remaining contract length of  years removing much of the shortterm risk of investing in this mlp source hoegh lng partners june  investor presentation slide  the company also has a favorable debt maturity profile other than negligible bank debt amortization hoegh lng partners has no debt maturing
