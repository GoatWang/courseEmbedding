your ebooks testimonials partners and clients upcoming events in the news staff     faqs is it a good idea to put my table of contents at the end of my ebook some people do this to increase the size of the free samples automatically generated by the ebook retailers however the kindle and other devices will reset the “last read location” to the end of the book if you have your table of contents there so we normally recommend against that practice what is the difference between html and xhtml html is the latest version of the html standard used on the web and in ebooks xhtml is a stricter and cleaner version of html with rules from xml imposed on the code for example when a tag is opened it has to be closed and all of the tags have to be properly nested xhtml allows the code to be more easily interpreted by the display engine and it keeps the code more consistent and easier to edit i have heard you can’t use color in ebooks is that correct no that is absolutely incorrect ebooks look great with color and we highly recommend using color images and even colored text within reason in your ebook files some devices have grayscale eink screens so the color will not show up on those devices however the color will be in the file and it will work on all of the color devices we do recommend you test colored text on a device with an eink screen and ensure that the text will not be too light to read do you need to have a separate isbn for each version of the ebook for different companies technically yes see an extended answer on our isbns page what is kindlegen kindlegen is amazon’s ebook creationcompiling program it is used on the kdp website to autoconvert files uploaded into the kindle store and it is also integrated into the kindle previewer program to handle the conversion of nonkindle files loaded in that program you can download kindlegen and get access to other kindle creation information at amazoncomkindlepublishing what is a fixed layout ebook fixed layout ebooks are htmlbased ebook files that are usually designed to match the layout of a print book the key difference between fixed layout files and reflowable files is that reflowable ebooks allow the reader to have more control over the reading experience such as changing the font size background color etc for more information please see our fixed layout children’s and nonfiction pages does amazon sell html files or only kindle amazon only sells ebooks in the kindle format but that format just like epub is built using html and css files how is fixed layout different from a pdf of the book fixed layout ebooks are built using html so they have more functionality than pdf files for example the narration overlay functionality used in many children’s ebooks is not possible in pdf files in addition none of the ebook retailers sell pdfs so fixed layout ebook files offer the best sales opportunities a university librarian told me they are not acquiring any kindle books but only htmlepub have you found that to be common with other libraries i know our local public library does buy kindle books libraries acquire their ebooks from services like m and overdrive these services sometimes offer an option for kindle checkouts but typically they are limited to epub files because of the more common use of the adobe drm has the kindle format gotten any more sophisticated in how it handles tables or floating images yes amazon’s kindle format  has support for many great design features including floating images tables color text embedded fonts and more how are page numbers handled in an ebook print book page numbers are included in the html code of both the kindle and epub formats as anchors they are also listed in the pagelist section of the ncx or navigation file the pagelist is used by some reading systems like the kindle and ibooks to show the reader the print page numbers of the book as they read how are page headers created in ebook files the different reading systems control what shows up in the header of your ebook most will display the title of the book and some will also display the author name that text cannot currently be set to display the chapter name or other information about where the reader is currently reading in the text how do ebooks handle hyphenation of long words some ebook reading systems will apply hyphenation to longer words to make the text better fit on the screen this is typically controlled by the reading system and will change depending on the font size and other settings the reader has set on their device what about protecting the file ebook file protection is called digital rights management drm please see our drm page for information on how it works and suggestions on how to use it can i sell my ebooks on my
