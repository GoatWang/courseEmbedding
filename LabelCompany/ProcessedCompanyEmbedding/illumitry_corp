established embroidery producers and that maintain a strong position in the market for example we face strong competition from sawam company and embdesign two armenian companies which specialize in

will be in a market where we compete directly with domestic and international companies offering similar products of embroidery larger embroidery companies may be able to provide more favorable services to customers many of these companies may have a greater customer base than us also many of these companies will be able to offer better price for similar product than us all of this competition may cause us to lose business to our competitors we anticipate challenges from other new market entrants we may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new embroidery companies which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation illumitry corp has only just entered the market with one customer we are at a competitive disadvantage in the market we are one of many participants in the embroidery business nearly all illumitry corp’s competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and
