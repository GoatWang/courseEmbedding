boydii n   s dysenteriae n    e vulneris and  e hermannii strains toward  antibiotics was examined mics were determined using a microdilution procedure all examined taxa were naturally sensitiveintermediate toward tetracyclines aminoglycosides some penicillins amoxycillinclavulanate ampicillinsulbactam piperacillin with and without tazobactam mezlocillin azlocillin cephalosporins carbapenems monobactams quinolones trimethoprim cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol and were naturally resistantintermediate toward benzylpenicillin oxacillin macrolides lincosamides glycopeptides rifampicin and fusidic acidno differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen between enterohemorrhagic and other e coli strains likewise with one exception no significant differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen either among the shigella subgroups or between shigella and e coli the natural population of s flexneri was slightly more susceptible to chloramphenicol than the natural populations of other taxa within the shigellae coli complex e vulneris and e hermannii showed susceptibility patterns to many antibiotics similar to shigella and e coli but there were other antibiotics toward which there were significant differences in natural susceptibility e vulneris and e hermannii were less susceptible to nitrofurantoin and slightly more susceptible to several aminoglycosides than e coli and shigella e hermannii was the only species that was naturally resistantintermediate to ticarcillin and amoxycillin din standard the addition of clavulanic acid to the latter resulted in a decrease of seven twofold dilution steps e vulneris four twofold dilution steps e colishigella two twofold dilution steps of the mics of the natural population with the exception of cefoperazone and cefepime e hermannii was more susceptible to cephalosporins than strains of the other species e vulneris was the species most susceptible to ticarcillin and the only species that was highly resistant to fosfomycin mic   μgml the antibiotic susceptibility to fosfomycin was also unique for e hermannii mic – μgml whereas the natural populations of e coli and shigella showed lower mic valuesthe data of this study represent an assessment of the natural susceptibility of strains of escherichia spp and shigella subgroups to a wide range of antibiotics these databases can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility test results of escherichia spp and shigellae the conformity of the natural antibiotic susceptibility test results not only among the shigella subgroups but also between shigella and e coli support the status of shigella as a subgroup of the species e coli to access this article please choose from the options below log in login to existing account
