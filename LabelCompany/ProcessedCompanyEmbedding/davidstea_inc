factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and

fully diluted income loss per share may differ from similar measures reported by other companies we believe that adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations we present adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe they facilitate a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under ifrs while isolating the effects of some items that vary from periodtoperiod specifically adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share allow for an assessment of our operating performance including new store costs without the effect of noncash charges of the period or other onetime charges such as depreciation amortization finance costs deferred rent noncash compensation expense costs related to onerous contracts or contracts where we expect the costs of the obligations to exceed the economic benefit gain loss on derivative financial instruments loss on disposal of property and equipment impairment of property and equipment and certain nonrecurring expenses these measures also function as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share are not measurements of our financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income net cash provided by operating investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity each as presented in accordance with ifrs we understand that although adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share are frequently used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of companies they have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under ifrs some of these limitations areread moreadjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and   although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacementsbecause of these limitations adjusted selling general and administration expenses adjusted results from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss and adjusted fully diluted income loss per share should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available
