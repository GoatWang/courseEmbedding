affirmed all  classes of wells fargo bank national association wfrbs commercial mortgage trust c commercial mortgage passthrough certificates wfrbs c a detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release key rating drivers the affirmations are based on the overall stable performance of the pools underlying collateral since issuance as of the april  distribution date the pools aggregate principal balance has been reduced by  to  billion from  billion at issuance per the servicer reporting five loans  of the pool are defeased interest shortfalls are currently affecting class h fitch modeled losses of  of the remaining pool expected losses on the original pool balance total  the pool has experienced no realized losses to date fitch has designated three loans  as fitch loans of concern which includes one specially serviced loan  the deterministic stress scenario was used in fitchs analysis in addition there was a variance from criteria related to classes b c d and e for which the model output suggested that an upgrade was possible fitch determined however that an upgrade was not warranted at this time as there have been no material changes to the performance of the pool since issuance and no significant increase in credit enhancement the largest fitch loan of concern is the plaza on richmond loan  which is secured by a  square foot sf retail center located in houston tx the subject is anchored by  hour fitness  of net rentable area through a lease that expires in october  other tenants include tj maxx  expiry january  and golf galaxy  expiry may  per servicer reporting the net operating income noi debt service coverage ratio dscr dropped to x as of yearend ye  from x as o as the interestonly period of the loan burned off in  the subject was  occupied as of the december  rent roll the next largest contributor to modeled losses is a loan  secured by a room extendedstay hotel located in san angelo tx the subject has experienced a drastic decline in occupancy due to a surplus of hotel rooms available and decreased demand for lodging from oil and gas sector employees the subjects primary client base fullyear occupancy declined to  in  from  in  the noi dscr was x as of december  the loan has been added as a fitch loan of concern and will continue to be monitored for further deterioration in performance the third largest contributor to modeled losses is a specially serviced loan  secured by a unit selfstorage facility located in houston tx the loan transferred to the special servicer in april  due to the bankruptcy filing of a guarantor the special servicer indicates it has filed a proof of claim against the guarantor to which the guarantor has filed an objection the most recent rent roll and financials provided by the servicer were as of september  and showed the subject as  occupied with a yeartodate noi dscr of x the loan remains current but will continue to be monitored for a resolution between the guarantor and the lender rating sensitivities the rating outlooks on all classes remain stable fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes
