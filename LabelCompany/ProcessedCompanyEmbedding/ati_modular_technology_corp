the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable

price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured we can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our products we also rely upon the sales and support services service agreement with yilaime for revenues we are implementing a new business plan and have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting in this area we also have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we end operations for the fourth quarter of  entering the first quarter of the next fiscal year we intend on relying on both yilaime and americatowne inc for operational support if we cannot achieve independent commercial success we may need to continue to rely on yilaime and americatowne for support if either company at any time decides to alter or change materially our arrangement we could experience a material adverse effect on the company additionally the results of operations are based upon a limited view since the controlling interest was acquired and a new business plan implemented results of operations for the three months ended march   and  our operating results for the three months ended march   and  are summarized as follows three months ended march   march   revenue     cost of revenues     operating expenses    net income loss       revenues during the first quarter of  the company generated revenue of  the companys revenues came from related parties for services rendered  for the service rights agreement with americatowne we can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our revenue producing contracts our revenues thus far rely entirely on related parties we are a new company and thus have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting we also have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we began operations in the second quarter of  operating expenses our expenses for the first months ended march   and  are outlined in the table below three months ended march   march   general and administrative     total operating expenses     our operating expenses are largely attributable to administrative expenses related to our reporting requirements as a public company and implementation of our business plan net income as a result of our operations the company reported net income before tax obligations of  for the first quarter of   liquidity and capital

offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources critical accounting policies our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the date of delivery to customers when a formal arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable the delivery is completed no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured the companys revenue recognition policy is provided in detail at note  of the financial statements income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a
