least one heteroatom typically  to  heteroatoms selected from nitrogen oxygen or sulfur unless otherwise defined such heterocyclic groups typically contain from  to  total ring atoms representative heterocyclic groups include by way of example monovalent species of pyrrolidine imidazolidine pyrazolidine piperidine dioxane morpholine thiomorpholine piperazine pyrroline and the like where the point of attachment is at any available carbon or nitrogen ring atom the term “vancomycin” is used herein in its art recognized manner to refer to the glycopeptide antibiotic known as vancomycin see for example r nagarajan “glycopeptide anitibiotics” marcel dekker inc  and references cited therein the designation “nvan” refers to substitution at the vancosamine nitrogen atom of vancomycin this position is also referred to as the n″ position of vancomycin the term “salt” when used in conjunction with a compound referred to herein refers to a salt of the compound derived from an inorganic or organic base or from an inorganic or organic acid salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum ammonium calcium copper ferric ferrous lithium magnesium manganic manganous potassium sodium zinc and the like particularly preferred are ammonium calcium magnesium potassium and sodium salts salts derived from organic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines including

pamoic pantothenic phosphoric succinic sulfuric tartaric ptoluenesulfonic and the like particularly preferred are citric hydrobromic hydrochloric maleic phosphoric sulfuric and tartaric acids the term “protecting group” or “blocking group” refers to a group which when covalently attached to a function group such as an amino hydroxyl thiol carboxyl carbonyl and the like prevents the functional group from undergoing undesired reactions but which permits the function group to be regenerated ie deprotected or unblocked upon treatment of the protecting group with a suitable reagent representative protecting groups are disclosed for example in t w greene and p g m wuts “protective groups in organic synthesis” rd ed  john wiley and sons ny the term “aminelabile protecting group” refers to a protecting group which is removed upon treatment with a suitable amine process conditions the process of the present invention is conducted in a single reaction vessel in multiple steps the first of these steps involves combining one equivalent of vancomycin or a salt thereof with one or more equivalents of an aldehyde of formula ii wherein r r and r are as defined herein and an excess of a suitable base in an inert diluent to form a reaction mixture preferably from about  to about  equivalents of the aldehyde are used in this step of the process more preferably about  to about  equivalents in this reaction mixture a mixture of imines andor hemiaminals is believed to be formed between the aldehyde and the basic nitrogen atoms of vancomycin ie the vancosamine nitrogen atom and the nterminal leucinyl nitrogen atom this first step of the present process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about ° c to about ° c preferably at ambient temperature ie about ° c for about  to about  hours preferably for about  to  hours or until formation of the imine andor hemiaminal is substantially complete this step of the process and the remaining steps are typically conducted in an inert diluent preferably the inert diluent is nndimethylformamide nndimethylacetamide nmethylpyrrolidinone acetonitrilewater and the like or mixtures thereof any suitable base may be employed in this step to neutralize the vancomycin salt and to facilitate formation of the imine andor hemiaminal including organic bases such as amines alkali metal carboxylate salt ie sodium acetate and the like and inorganic bases such as alkali metal carbonates ie lithium carbonate potassium carbonate and the like preferably the base used in this step is a tertiary amine including by way of illustration triethylamine diisopropylethylamine nmethylmorpholine and the like a preferred base is diisopropylethylamine the base is typically employed in a molar excess relative to vancomycin preferably the base is used in an amount ranging from about  to about  equivalents based on vancomycin more preferably about  to  equivalents when formation of the imine andor hemiaminal mixture is substantially complete the reaction mixture is acidified with an excess of acid any suitable acid may be employed in this step of the process including by way of illustration carboxylic acids eg acetic acid trichloroacetic acid citric acid formic acid trifluoroacetic acid methanesulfonic acid toluenesulfonic acid and the like mineral acids eg hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid and the like preferably the acid employed in this step is trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid the acid is typically added in a molar excess relative to vancomycin and the base preferably the acid is used in an amount ranging from about  to about  equivalents based on vancomycin more preferably about  to  equivalents while not wishing to be limited by theory it is believed that the acid selectively hydrolyzes the imine andor hemiaminal formed at the nterminal amine of vancomycin in preference to the imine andor hemiaminal formed at the vancosamine nitrogen atom this acidification step is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about ° c to about ° c preferably at about ° c for about  to about  hours preferably for about  to about  hours preferably a polar protic solvent is added during this step including by way of example methanol ethanol propanol isopropanol butanol ethylene glycol and the like alternatively a mixed polar proticnonprotic solvent may be used such as methanoltetrahydrofuran methanoldimethoxyethane and the like after the acidification step the reaction mixture is then contacted with a reducing agent to reduce the imine andor hemiaminal any suitable reducing agent can be employed in this step of the process which is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide for example suitable reducing agents include sodium borohydride sodium cyanoborohydride zinc borohydride sodium triacetoxyborohydride pyridineborane tertbutylamineborane nmethylmorpholineborane ammoniaborane dimethylamineborane triethylamineborane trimethylamineborane and the like preferred reducing agents are amineborane complexes such as pyridineborane and tertbutylamineborane this reduction step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about ° c to about ° c preferably at about ° c for about  to about  hours preferably for about  to about  hours or until the reduction is substantially complete preferably a polar protic solvent is present during this reduction step the polar protic solvent is preferably added during the acidification step described above in contrast to prior procedures the product of the reductive alkylation process is not isolated but the reaction mixture is contacted with an amine to remove the protecting group ie r from the intermediate product any suitable amine may be used in this step of the process representative amines suitable for use include by way of example methylamine ethylamine tertbutylamine triethylamine piperidine morpholine ammonium hydroxide and the like preferred amines are methylamine tertbutylamine and ammonium hydroxide this deprotection step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about ° c to about ° c preferably at about ° c to about ° c for about  to about  hours preferably for about  to about  hours or until the reaction is substantially complete the resulting compound of formula i is readily isolated and purified by conventional procedures such as precipitation andor reversephase hplc the aldehydes of formula ii employed in the process of the present invention are wellknown in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents for example see wo  published on jul   which describes various methods for preparing such aldehydes among other advantages the process of the present invention provides for improved selectivity ie reductive alkylation at the vancosamine amino group is favored over reductive alkylation at the nterminus eg the leucinyl group by at least  more preferably  additionally because the multistep process is conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the reaction intermediates the process of the present invention is more efficient provides a higher yield and generates less waste then previous processes the glycopeptide derivatives produced by the process of this invention are useful as antibiotics and as intermediates for the production of antibiotics see for example us patent application ser no  filed dec   and us patent
