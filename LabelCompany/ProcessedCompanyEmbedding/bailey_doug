– the roadrecovery legends of the road – david bailey doug henry micky dymond and jeff ward – are in the final days of preparing for the competition of a lifetime the  race across america raam which will take them more than  miles from oceanside calif to annapolis md over the course of six to eight days starting june   the team will cycle across the country in a race against time traversing major climate changes as they pass three major mountain ranges sierra rocky and appalachian cross four of america’s longest rivers colorado mississippi missouri and ohio and pass through the mojave desert sonoran deserts monument valley and the great plains in a test of mental and physical stamina like no other bailey  henry  dymond  and ward  the legends of the road are not your typical competitors among them they’ve earned multiple ama supercrossmotocross champion titles world champion titles and motorcycle hall of fame inductions but their accolades as athletes are not what sets this team apart it’s the fact that half the team will be competing in the raam on hand cycles david bailey and doug henry both suffered spinal cord injuries while doing what they loved bailey was injured in january of 9 while practicing for the upcoming supercross season at a track in lake huron calif there was significant spinal cord damage and he became paralyzed from the chest down almost  years later in march of  henry broke his back while racing in a supermoto race he now suffers partial paralysis from the waist down while this might break the spirits of some these two strong competitors and athletes have used their injuries to inspire others in 99 bailey started training for the hawaii ironman triathlon in his first two attempts he finished in third place then second finally in  he became ironman world champion in his division  years after his accident seven years after doug henry’s injury he competed and won third place at winter xgames  in the “adaptive snowmobile” class  after watching micky dymond and his team of four race raam back in  bailey became inspired to do the same he wanted to put together a team of athletes and his goal was much greater than winning “my hope is both to inspire and raise additional money for athletes who need a boost to get going again” bailey said “roadrecovery helped me back in  when i was in bad shape physically and financially it’s the least i can do to demonstrate how much it helps when you have that extra boost and motivation to be at your best”  the team chooses to carry on the tradition of the name “the legends of the road” in tribute to micky’s first raam team – comprised of dymond dave mirra ben bostrom and dave zabriskie – that raced in  winning the fourperson team category the late dave mirra coined the team name and this new group of legends hopes to do it justice this year and carry on the name for many years to come  to learn more about the legends of the road raam and to support the team please
