university of illinois at chicagomichael s saxon affiliation not provided to ssrn date written april  abstract this paper explores the origins and evolution of product markets from a sociocognitive perspective product markets are defined as sociallyconstructed knowledge structures ie product conceptual systems that are shared among produces and consumerssharing that allows consumers and producers to interact in the market our fundamental thesis is that product markets are neither imposed nor orchestrated by producers or consumers but evolve from producerconsumer interaction feedback effects starting as unstable incomplete and disjointed conceptual systems held by market actorswhich are revealed in the cacophony of uses claims and product standards that characterize emerging product marketswe propose that product markets become coherent as a result of consumers and producers making sense of one anothers behaviors we further argue that the sensemaking process is revealed in the stories that consumer magazines and producers tell one another in published media such as industry newspapers and consumer magazines which we use as date sources specific hypothesis pertaining to the use of product category labels in published sources and the acceptability of different product category members throughout the development process are tested for the minivan market between  and  our findings suggest that category labels for emerging and preexisting categories our findings also show that as stabilization occurred around a category prototype the acceptability of particular models changed without any physical changes to the models jel classification l suggested citation suggested citation rosa josé antonio and porac joseph f and spanjol jelena and saxon michael s
