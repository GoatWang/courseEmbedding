our leaderboard the big idea when we started our leaderboard was to create a dynamic ranking of members who take the time to contribute content to make backcountrycom and the gear information we share better the problem though was that it wasn’t dynamic at all the few and the proud reached the top of the board and stayed there forever that means that we didn’t do a very good job of building the system we also didn’t do a good job of being transparent either nobody not even the leaderboard champs knew how many points they had how many points they needed to overtake the person in front of them or who was coming up from behind we had to do better so here’s what we’ve decided to changeweve increased the value of certain contributions now instead of  point for every action you’ll earn points every time you post a video photo or review points every time you answer a question point every time you vote something as helpful leave a comment or ask a questioneach point now has a halflife and automatically changes to halfpoint after  days if you don’t post for a long time you’ll fall in the rankingspoint totals will be calculated nightlyyou’ll see exactly how many points everyone on the leaderboard hasin short we’re adding a little more game to the game we know that change is well different but we really hope that you check it out and keep contributing we’re going to do what we can to keep things exciting in the community and that means more changes down the line if you have any great ideas please let our community product manager know   clint gordoncarroll cgcbackcountrycom in
