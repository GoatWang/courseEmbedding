exchange traded funds etfs have become increasingly popular among many types of investors some misperceptions have arisen including that they are less liquid or harder to sell than other investments in fact the opposite has been true etfs are not only generally easy to trade but they also can play an important role in rebalancing supply and demand during market volatilityhere’s a look at where etf liquidity comes from and why it matters for investors it’s been said that liquidity is like oxygen you only notice it when it’s gone and indeed under normal conditions liquidity is taken for granted with enough buyers and sellers in the market to avoid dramatic changes in an asset’s price as it trades that balance can be upset during market crises when there are often many more sellers than buyers liquidity risk is the possibility that a lack of liquidity will make it difficult and costly to enter and more importantly to exit trading positions etfs are funds that trade on an exchange like individual securities and just like mutual funds and securities etf investments will be more or less liquid depending on market conditions the more liquid they are the easier and more costeffectively they tend to trade etf liquidity is derived from two main sources that are constantly interacting based on market activity because etf exchange trades match buyerssellers with no direct trading of the etf’s underlying holdings etf liquidity on exchanges is incremental to underlying market liquidity where does etf liquidity come from it’s derived from two main sources that are constantly interacting based on market activity source  the underlying etf basket as with mutual funds etfs “wrap” a collection of securities known as the basket that etf wrapper is then divided into shares which are traded freely over an exchange just as a stock is traded buying and selling a collective exposure is much easier and cheaper than trying to trade each of the individual securities separately the starting point for any discussion on etf liquidity begins with the basket and the process for creating and redeeming shares new shares are created by authorized participants aps the specialized firms that buy and sell an etf’s published basket a representative portion of its investment portfolio in exchange for shares those shares are provided by an etf sponsor like ishares since the basket can be exchanged for shares at any point and vice versa an etf will be at least as liquid as its underlying basket of securities thus an etf with an underlying basket of largecap us stocks will generally be more liquid with a tighter bidask spread than one that tracks a basket of international smallcap stocks source  the stock exchange etfs have access to an additional layer of liquidity on the exchange the new york stock exchange for example this is where you’ll find almost all individual investors and financial advisors trading etfs etf liquidity on an exchange is driven largely by supply and demand as buyers and sellers meet throughout the trading day just as they would with an individual stock the ability to match buyers and sellers in this market without the need to create or redeem shares from the basket benefits investors by lowering overall transaction costs and fostering greater liquidity etf liquidity on an exchange is driven largely by supply and demand as buyers and sellers meet throughout the trading day just as they would with an individual stock most etf shares trade hands many more times on the exchange than through the creationredemption process this is very different from mutual funds whose only source of liquidity is the fund provider managing liquidity risk in volatile markets in turbulent markets there is often an imbalance in the number of buyers and sellers what happens to etfs on extreme days when there is a strong influx of sellers all at once in such a case the aps may step in as a buyer of etf shares from investors priced at the value of the securities in the basket those shares are handed back to the etf sponsor in exchange for physical shares of the underlying securities which the aps can then resell on the market ultimately reducing the number of shares available on the exchange can improve the liquidity of the market as a whole by helping to restore the balance of supply and demand see “do etfs add market volatility” etf vs mutual fund liquidity etfs and mutual funds have a number of similarities both are structured to provide diversified exposure to an asset class or sector and sliced into shares that reflect a portion of the underlying holdings however during many market environments etfs can actually access an additional layer of liquidity on the stock exchange where buyers and sellers can offset each others transactions without necessarily having to trade in the underlying market for more information on the differences between etfs and mutual funds please click here go deeper on etf mechanics
