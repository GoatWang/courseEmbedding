with only one speed are set to run at the higher speeds required to clean the pool rather than simply providing filtration at all times therefore the energy required to run the pump during filtration operation is wasted by running faster than necessary an energy star certified pool pump can run at different speeds and be programmed to match the pool operation with its appropriate pool pump speed
