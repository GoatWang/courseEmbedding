emcore a forgotten optics company  emcore corporation nasdaqemkr  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»emcore a forgotten optics companyjan  about emcore corporation emkr dylan quintilone longshort equity internet tech growth at reasonable pricesummaryemcore is financially secure with a robust balance sheet and is ebitda positive no longterm debt and a mountain of cashthey are experiencing a unique opportunity in their docsis  product line fueled by their top customer arris corporationthey remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and a special dividendthey continue to be a takeout candidate of a larger optics company which could see shareholders receive  per sharethe recent sell off in emcore nasdaq emkr seems to be driven by confused shareholders it stems from the disposal of the space solar business because that division was the most profitable portion of the business the remaining fiber division has value and i will explain why price target  the remaining business emcore corporation is a vertically integrated optical communication component and indium phosphide inp chip manufacturer their products are integral to the cable tv docsis  buildout as well infrastructure spending in fiber to the premise fttp datacom and telecom applications the recent sale of emcores space photovoltaic division for  million in cash has created a focused optical manufacturer and a robust balance sheet in the process emcores strong balance sheet has allowed the board of directors to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing  million in common stock by use of a dutch auction they also stated they will likely offer a onetime cash dividend toward the beginning of  key growth drivers key growth drivers are accelerated spending by emcores customers to meet the demand for increased bandwidth and surprising demand for their wafer chips revenue drivers result from the transition from traditional copper based internet infrastructure to a hybrid fiber network high bandwidth applications such as k television adaptation streaming television services web browsing and applications accelerate the need for service providers to update their existing infrastructure one gigabit per second internet speeds will be required to operate in the growing technological space and emcore provides products necessary to facilitate gigabit per second internet connections at a reduced cost in comparison to traditional fiber networks according to jeff heynen of ihs in a survey issued for cable operators which control  of the worlds capital expenditures in cable spending  of the cable operators plan to deploy a distributed access architecture or hybrid fiber cable network by  this data strengthens the thesis which emcore is primed to capitalize on with increased spending for hfc networks heynen  underlying business is accelerating two of emcores  customers arris and pace announced a merger in the spring of  merger which caused arris and pace to pause spending on docsis  line cards and end user products toward the end of  the arrispace merger closed at the beginning of january  so spending should resume to accelerated levels the main catalyst accelerating arris spending for docsis  products is a contract they secured with the australian government nbn co the government business enterprise delivers a high speed broadband access network to all australians which chose to build its nextgeneration hybrid fibercoaxial broadband network the australian hybrid fiber network provides emcore increased revenue through additional sales volume of their catv and fttp products from  to  emcores asia segment revenue grew  from  million to  million with arris installing docsis  in australia i expect emcores asia segment sales to double to  million in fiscal  this growth potential makes emcore appealing to a competitor the main factor for stock price appreciation is the potential buyout or merger of emcores remaining fiber business according to the companys fiscal  k it states the strategy committee may from time to time consider strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value which may include acquisitions investments in joint ventures partnerships and other strategic alternatives such as dispositions reorganizations recapitalizations or other similar transactionk this statement leads me to consider emcore remains open to strategies of being acquired and merging with another company if the opportunity presents itself some things that need to occur for there to be a buyout reduce the cash position satisfy the liabilities from a valuation perspective as of fourth quarter  they had  in cash and equivalents less  in total liabilities worth  a share i believe emcore would have to return most of this capital to shareholders in the form of a cash dividend while maintaining ample working capital to see themselves through an acquisition this is good for shareholders because in order to make their underlying business valuation look attractive to a competitor shareholders would receive most of this cash somewhere between  through  per share otherwise it creates an added premium for an acquirer to pay current shareholders and reduces the likelihood of an acquisition assuming this cash is returned to shareholders this leads me to value their continuing operations their underlying business is worth  per share emcores continuing operations show strength by being ebitda positive once you add back sharebased compensation and depreciation and continuing down the path toward profitability this creates a situation to seek out a comparable buyout the most recent comparable situation is koch industries acquiring oplink communications for  million link which equates to a price to sales ratio of  if emcore were to be acquired based on their run rate of  million in annual revenue for fiscal  i reach a valuation of  per share a  times price to sales ratio is possible because of emcores sustained revenue growth in the market segments of docsis  and inp product lines this becomes a value adding segment to an acquirer now that the underlying business is valued i move on to the value of their accumulated net operating loss nol tax benefits their tax benefits are worth an additional  per share another more complicated component is emcore historically has been unprofitable which has allowed them to accumulate  in net operating loss benefits nol which can be carried forward  years or backwards two years and these nols apply to their operating income to reduce their own or their acquirers tax payments nols are of a particular interest because if emcore is acquired these nols may cause the acquirer to pay a premium to utilize more nols from the annual sec  deduction limit as of the most recent quarter emcore had  million in federal nols subject to sec  limitations and  million in unencumbered nols which may be utilized immediately upon acquisition the unencumbered nols can be used all at once or at the discretion of the acquirer to be conservative i derive  million in value for emcores nols or another  per share in value based on the tax savings to an acquirer an underlying business trading at a discount in summary shareholders could receive a large dividend of  to  per share while also having an underlying business valued at  after explaining how i derive value my price target is  per share or a market capitalization of  million emcore looks attractively priced at these levels because of the anticipated spending acceleration in docsis  products the probable onetime special dividend and the possibility of a sale to a competitor from the closing price  on  the potential return to  is  disclosure i amwe are long emkr arrs i
