financial statements as of september   and december   stated in us dollars    nature of operations   punto group corp the “company” is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the state of nevada united states of america on september     the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and are presented in us dollars the financial statements and related disclosures as of september   are reviewed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission “sec”   unless the context otherwise requires all references to “punto group corp” “we” “us” “our” or the “company” are to punto group corp and any subsidiaries     basis of presentation and going concern   basis of presentation   the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   the statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the sec accordingly certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and other information included in the companys annual report on form q for the quarter ended september   as filed with the sec   going concern   the accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern for the period ended september   the company had accumulated deficits of  the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt financing andor through sales of common stock   management plans to fund operations of the company through the proceeds from an offering pursuant to a registration statement on form s or private placements of restricted securities or the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as profitable operations are achieved if we do not raise all of the money we need from public offerings we will have to find alternative sources such as loans or advances from our officers directors or others such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term there are no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available in the future management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern   the failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the company                   punto group corp notes to financial statements as of september   and december   stated in us dollars        summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates   due to the limited level of operations the company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the company is a going concern   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments   asc  “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments  asc  “fair value measurements” defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of september     the respective carrying values of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximate their fair values  these financial instruments include cash accrued liabilities and notes payable  fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value   basic and diluted loss per share   the company computes earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period  diluted earnings loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  dilutive earnings loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive the company has no potential dilutive instruments and therefore basic and diluted earnings loss per share are equal                  punto group corp notes to financial statements as of september   and december   stated in us dollars     revenue recognition   the company will recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification no  “revenue recognition” asc asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized      persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

away we have answers common questions what is a limited liability company a limited liability company or llc is a business entity created under state law that combines characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are generally not personally liable for company debts like a sole proprietorship or a partnership an llc is by default a pass through entity for tax purposes this means that the llc does not pay taxes on its profits but instead profits and losses are passed through to the owners who must then pay tax on their share of llc income how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation what is the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation s corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability do i need a name or dba for my
