agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement which is filed as exhibit  hereto and is incorporated herein by reference    description of business   zeecol provides environmentally lowimpact farming integration solutions zeecol’s plan is to incorporate proven farming technology with its own proprietary processes to eliminate the carbon footprint of its client farmers while substantially reducing its client’s operating costs and easing regulatory scrutiny   the primary zeecol system will take low value products derived from animals including all waste streams on a dairy farm or feed lot and efficiently producesconverts them into high value products such as energy and animal feed that are sold back to the farmer on long term contracts the objective is to reduce both environmental costs and dollar costs of farming  zeecol has not earned any revenues to date   the process will utilize an anaerobic digester that makes waste suitable for use by plants and a photo bioreactor that supports colonies of highly efficient single celled plants called micro algae  the cows and steers will essentially “feed” the digester and the digester feeds the photo bioreactor finally the photo bioreactor will feed the cows and steers in a closed cycle  throughout the process fuel electricity and fertilizer will be produced as saleable byproducts in this way the zeecol eliminates all waste while supercharging what happens naturally   a high level mass flow schematic of a zeecol digester   click to enlarge                zeecol is addressing an unmet need in the marketplace   zeecol is uniquely qualified to address a virtually untapped need in the dairy farming market   • dairy farms in new zealand and in most countries are currently required to develop an acceptable sewage management plan or face shutdown   • equipment dealers currently require farmers to arrange financing of all purchases which represents a substantial capital investment that many farmers are unable or unwilling to do equipment dealers are becoming increasingly receptive to alternative means for equipment financing   • financial downturns cause a large amount of financial pressure on farms equipment dealers need a quick solution which zeecol can provide   • zeecol has a solid management team that is both knowledgeable in farm waste treatment and also is familiar with working with distressed equipment dealers   • through its team’s expertise zeecol has developed systems for purchasing managing and selling products from waste treatment equipment   • zeecol has been active with various dairy groups and our management team is known in the dairy community   • zeecol works with vendors that provide it with engineering digesters and a cryogenic process   zeecol also intends to make acquisitions of distressed farms in  that have become weakened primarily by the drop in milk solid sales or by other inefficiencies management has candidates in the short term pipeline and the timing of these acquisitions will coincide with zeecol’s ability to obtain acquisition financing   continuing efforts of zeecol with green dragon wood products   in its many discussions with mr lee zeecol intends work closely with mr lee to optimize its assets and grow its operations a primary initiative in this regard will involve applying zeecol’s process that builds efficiencies into dairy farming to the development of specialty wood products the science behind such a process has been well documented but testing must be done before mass production of any kind will be executed the leaves of trees supply sugars to make sap that flow in the xylem which is the region that forms rings and builds up the tree’s every cell for many years scientists have described how xylem cells can be grown in a test tube filled with synthetic sap and all the things that can be done with those cells   the process being tested in this capacity would create specialty wood or veneer products by using algae instead of leaves to produce high quality tree sap to grow wood in test tubes a culture of cells found in the tree xylem will be applied back to the trees to encourage rapid growth and the residual substance is then mixed with natural plant hormones that cause the cells to exude lignin thereby binding the cells of the material together  as the lignin hardens the residual substance is formed first into fibers and then pressed into sheets with an appropriate amount of air  the resulting products that zeecol hopes to develop from this process will range from a fine sheet of paper to a veneer or even a stick of lumber  beyond mass production of quality veneers theoretically from test tubes instead of forests zeecol can seek to supply the market demand for hardwoods and leave nature only as a source of natural cells for the required culture zeecol intends to create many variations of this “wood ink”’ of natural cells that would then be assembled by a d wood printer to print hardwoods on demand in any shape needed zeecol does not process leaves into algae  zeecol uses algae instead of leaves to produce high quality tree sap to grow wood in test tubes in this way zeecol produces the wood equal to millions of trees from one tree saving our timber for nature              management team   william mook chief executive officer  mr

ifrs   the company is designated as a profit oriented entity for financial reporting purposes the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the financial reporting act    b functional and presentation currency   the financial statements are presented in new zealand dollars  which is the companys functional currency rounded to the nearest dollar   c basis of preparation   the accrual basis of accounting has been used with the exception of compiling the statement of cash flows   the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis   d comparative figures   these financial statements are for a  month period comparative  months to  march     significant accounting policies   the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated   a revenue recognition   revenue from the sale of goods and services is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable revenue is recognised as follows   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     significant accounting policies continued   a revenue recognition continued   i interest income   interest income is recognised when it is probable that the company will receive the amount and it can be measured reliably interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method   ii sale of goods   revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and it is probable that the company will receive the previously agreed upon payment these criteria are considered to be met when the goods are delivered to the buyer no revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due associated costs or the possible return of goods or where there is continuing management involvement with the goods   deposits received in advance from customers in anticipation of the future sale of goods are recognised as revenue only once the above criteria has been met if the criteria has not been met they are carried as deferred revenue on the statement of financial position   b cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand deposits held at call with financial institutions and the custodian other shortterm deposits highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value   c foreign currency transactions and balances   transactions entered into by the company in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur the company does not hold any foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities foreign currency gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period incurred   d income tax   tax expense comprises current and deferred tax current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income   current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years   deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes   deferred tax is not recognised for  i temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss ii temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     significant accounting policies continued   d income tax continued   deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date   recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised   deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously   e judgements estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in accordance with nz ifrs and ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires the company to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in accompanying notes actual results may differ from these estimates   f goods and services tax gst   the financial statements have been prepared on a gst exclusive basis as the company is required to be registered for gst accounts receivable and accounts payable are gst inclusive   g financial instruments   recognition financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position initially at fair value plus for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition financial instruments are measured as described below   a financial instrument is recognised when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument   offsetting financial instruments financial instruments are offset and presented as a net asset or net liability in the statement of financial position when the substance of an arrangement is such that presenting them together as either a net asset or a net liability more accurately reflects the companys expected future cash flows for settling two or more separate financial instruments this only occurs when the company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously   derecognition financial assets are derecognised if the company’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the company transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset   financial liabilities are derecognised if the company’s obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     significant accounting policies continued   g financial instruments continued   nonderivative financial instruments nonderivative financial instruments comprise loans and receivables and trade and other payables   loans and receivables loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents term deposits and trade and other receivables   interest on loans and receivables is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand deposits held at call with banks other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less   term deposits include deposits held with financial institutions with original maturities greater than three months   trade and other receivables of a shortterm nature are not discounted   trade and other payables trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method trade payables of a shortterm nature are not discounted   derivative financial instruments the company does not invest or trade in derivative financial instruments and therefore is not exposed to the associated risk rewards and financial impacts both positive and negative associated with such instruments   h impairment   financial assets the company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets stated at cost or amortised cost is impaired   if any such indication exists an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate   the company considers the following indicators when assessing whether there is objective evidence of impairment   i significant decline in the market value of an asset ii significant changes that adversely affect the company in the technological market economic or legal environment in which it operates   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     significant accounting policies continued   h impairment continued   iii increases in market interest rates or other market rates of return that are likely to affect the discount rate used to assess the present value of the future cash flows from the asset iv when the carrying amount of the companys net assets exceeds the market capitalisation of the company v evidence of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset vi significant change in the use of an asset that adversely affects the company vii declining economic performance which might be indicated by larger than expected maintenance costs or lower than expected profits from the use of an asset   nonfinancial assets the carrying amounts of the companys assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence of impairment if any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated   an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount impairment losses directly reduce the carrying amount of assets and are recognised in profit or loss   the estimated recoverable amount of nonfinancial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use value in use is determined by estimating future cash flows from the use and ultimate disposal of the asset and discounting these to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market rates and the risks specific to the asset for an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs   a cash generating unit is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of the other assets or groups of assets   impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis   impairment losses are reversed when there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and there is an indication that the impairment loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised   i property plant and equipment   i recognition and measurement items of property plant and equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses as well as the purchase price cost includes directly attributable costs and where relevant the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items   ii subsequent costs subsequent costs are added to the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment when the cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all other costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense when incurred   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     significant accounting policies continued   i property plant and equipment continued   iii depreciation for plant and equipment depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value depreciation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a diminishing value basis over the estimated useful lives of each item of property plant and equipment   depreciation on assets under construction does not commence until they are complete and available for use   depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate depreciation has been calculated on plant and equipment using the diminishing value method at      j share capital   ordinary shares ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects    changes in accounting policies   there have been no changes in accounting policies all policies have been applied on a basis consistent with those from previous financial statements    new standards and interpretations not yet adopted   the company has reviewed those standards and interpretations which have been issued but which are not yet effective for the period ending  march  the following have been deemed to be relevant to the company   nz ifrs   financial instruments   nz ifrs  financial instruments was approved for periods beginning on or after  january  nz ifrs  specifies how an entity should classify and measure its financial assets it requires that all financial assets be reclassified in their entirety on the basis of the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and contractual cash flow obligations of the financial assets financial assets are measured at either amortised cost or fair value   nz ifrs  only permits the recognition of fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income if they relate to equity investments that are not held for trading the company does not hold equity instruments and therefore there will be no impact on the companys accounting for financial assets or liabilities   the adoption of nz ifrs  is unlikely to result in material changes to the presentation and measurement of financial assets and liabilities and accordingly the company has chosen not to early adopt this standard   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     new standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued   nz ifrs   revenue from contracts with customers   nz ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers was approved for periods beginning on or after  january  nz ifrs  establishes revenue recognition principles for all contracts with customers   the core principle of nz ifrs  is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this core principle is delivered in a fivestep model framework   a identify the contracts with a customer b identify the performance obligations in the contract c determine the transaction price d allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract e recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation   under the current standard  nz ias  the revenue received from customers has been deferred and recorded as deferred revenue as the criteria for recognising revenue in the statement of comprehensive income has not been met refer to revenue accounting policy under note  significant account policies for more information   the adoption of nz ifrs  will not alter this treatment as the performance obligations in the customer contracts have not been satisfied and accordingly revenue cannot be recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income accordingly the adoption of nz ifrs  is unlikely to result in material changes to the presentation and measurement of revenue and therefore the company has chosen not to early adopt this standard   nz ias  amendment  disclosure initiatives   the external reporting board xrb issued amendments to nz ias  presentation of financial statements which were approved for periods beginning on or after  january    the amendments have been issued as part of a project to improve presentation and disclosure requirements and   a clarify that an entity should not obscure useful information by aggregating or disaggregating information and that materiality considerations apply to the primary statements notes and any specific disclosure requirements in nz ifrss   b clarify that the list of line items specified by nz ias  for the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income can be disaggregated and aggregated as relevant additional guidance has also been added on the presentation of subtotals in these statements   c clarify that entities have flexibility when designing the structure of the notes and provide guidance on how to determine a systematic order of the notes   the company believes that the disclosures in the financial statements have been as transparent as possible and adoption of the amendments is unlikely to result in material changes to the presentation and disclosures in the financial statements and therefore the company has chosen not to early adopt this standard   page      zeecol limited     notes to the financial statements for the year ended  march     taxation   a income tax recognised in

accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of condensed consolidated our financial statements   we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our condensed consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations          accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts   accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest which are due within contractual payment terms generally  to  days from shipment the company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business based on evaluation of a customers financial condition the customer creditworthiness and their payment history accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due past due balances over  days and those over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis using historical collection trends and aging of receivables management also periodically evaluates individual customer’s financial condition credit history and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote   the credit terms of our two major customers are summarized as below   major customers   contractual credit term   repayment term            customer a    to  days   accounts receivable are repaid on a regular basis to the company and the cash receipt is made to customer b upon the instruction of the company           customer b also a major supplier    to  days   customer b receives the cash settlement from customer a and the aggregate receivable will offset against its trade payable   in march  the company entered into a triparties settlement arrangement among customer a and customer b under such arrangement customer a agreed to transfer its accounts receivable balance to customer b and customer b agreed to receive such accounts receivable balance from customer a on behalf of the company to offset against its trade payable due to the company   accounting standard codification asc topic    we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  “revenue recognition” when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured   the majority of the companys revenue results from sales contracts with direct customers and revenues are generated upon the shipment of goods the companys pricing structure is fixed and there are no rebate or discount programs management conducts credit background checks for new customers as a means to reduce the subjectivity of assuring collectability based on these factors the company believes that it can apply the provisions of asc topic  with minimal subjectivity   recent accounting pronouncements   the company has reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition

company entered into a triparties settlement arrangement among two major customers customer a and party b under such arrangement customer a agreed to transfer its accounts receivable balance to party b and party b agreed to receive such accounts receivable balance from customer a on behalf of the company to offset against its trade payable due to the company   pursuant to the terms of the triparties settlement arrangement among customer a party b and us    customer a agrees to make cash payments directly to the designated bank accounts of party b per our monthly instruction  we and party b agree to offset the cash proceeds against the accounts payable which we owe to party b and  in any event if party b is not reimbursed by customer a we are responsible to chase customer a for the settlement under obligation among the sales contracts  meanwhile we are legally liable to repay the accounts payable to party b under the purchase contract   under this arrangement we can assure the collection from customer a to meet with the purchase payable due to party b on a timely basis we also can reduce the time and costs to handle the fund remittance among customer a party b and ourselves as we continue to make the purchase orders to party b the accounts receivable originally due from customer a will be gradually eliminated and offset by our future accounts payable due to party b   we have developed a prolonged business relationship with party “b” in the sale and related products over years in the normal course of business party b is acting as a “customer” or a “vendor” who generally sells and buys different types of wood products to and from us on an armlength basis these sale and purchases transactions are independent    we expect to sustain and continue this prolonged business relationship with party b because    party b has a longterm commercial history and experience in sale and procurement of wood products in china  party b has developed an extensive marketing and sourcing network in china and  we have built up a prolonged trust and confidence in doing business with each other          we believe that there is no collectability concern with regard to the accounts receivable balance due from party b which will be recoverable by our future purchase orders   as of june   and march   there was no accounts receivable balance transferred from customer a to party b as of june   and march   the aging analysis of party b is as follow       as of       june       march      days              days                days                days

results of operations   working capital   our working capital was  and  on june   and march   respectively   we currently generate our cash flow through our operations we believe that our cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next  months   there is no identifiable expansion plan as of june   but from time to time we may identify new business opportunities to improve the profitability and working capital from operations   capital resources   as of june   the company has a revolving line of credit with dbs bank hong kong limited

arrangement with tai wah timber factory limited provides for borrowings with interest rate at  per annum and the interest is required to pay monthly   as of june  and march   the outstanding balance was  and  respectively   while the capital resources of the company are stable from a cash perspective the credit of the company for debt financing if necessary is extremely strong due to our strong banking relations and the credit facilities provided for our veneer products from time to time we do have a need to exercise our credit options on a short term basis due to the nature of our business as importersexporters the company has established lines of credit with banks and management maintains very strong relations with these banks management believes that its current lines of credit are more than sufficient to cover any short and long term liquidity needs our historical financial liquidity needs have been shown to be more than adequately covered by our credit facilities  we believe that the strength of our management team to maintain strict internal control of its cash flow and liquidity that the current credit facilities are adequate for our needs   our accounts receivable balance as of june   is  our accounts receivable are not considered by management to be high due to the nature of payment for our products  our clients are required to provide credit facilities for their product by a letter of credit or other negotiable method of payment for the amount owed  we draw from the letter of credit prior to delivery only in the event that it is needed to maintain sufficient cash flow to cover our operations  we pay the cost of drawing on any letter of credit  because our cash flow is typically sufficient to cover our operations we do not carry accounts receivable unless prior arrangements have been made  it is company policy to recognize revenue when the product is shipped to our customers    in the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business efforts or if the company is pursued by a larger company for a business combination we will analyze all strategies to continue the company and increase shareholder value  only under these circumstances would we consider a merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance a rollup or other business combination to increase business and potentially increase the shareholder value of the company  management believes its responsibility to increase shareholder value is of paramount importance which means the company should consider the aforementioned alternatives in the

accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of condensed consolidated our financial statements we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our condensed consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest which are due within contractual payment terms generally  to  days from shipment the company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business based on evaluation of a customers financial condition the customer creditworthiness and their payment history accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due past due balances over  days and those over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis using historical collection trends and aging of receivables management also periodically evaluates individual customers financial condition credit history and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the credit terms of our two major customers are summarized as below contractual credit major customers term repayment term  customer a  to  days accounts receivable are repaid on a regular basis to the company and the cash receipt is made to customer b upon the instruction of the company customer b also a  to  days customer b receives the cash settlement major supplier from customer a and the aggregate receivable will offset against its trade payable in march  the company entered into a triparties settlement arrangement among customer a and customer b under such arrangement customer a agreed to transfer its accounts receivable balance to customer b and customer b agreed to receive such accounts receivable balance from customer a on behalf of the company to offset against its trade payable due to the company accounting standard codification asc topic  we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the majority of the companys revenue results from sales contracts with direct customers and revenues are generated upon the shipment of goods the companys pricing structure is fixed and there are no rebate or discount programs management conducts credit background checks for new customers as a means to reduce the subjectivity of assuring collectability based on these factors the company believes that it can apply the provisions of asc topic  with minimal subjectivity recent accounting pronouncements the company has reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations results of operations

primarily attributed to the cooling measures implemented in the peoples republic of china to fix chinas overheated real estate market this slowing of the real estate market has resulted in less demand for our products as most of our clients are in the interior decorating and furniture business additionally our traditional markets in europe and the middle east have also suffered a dramatic drop as

settlement arrangement among two major customers customer a and party b under such arrangement customer a agreed to transfer its accounts receivable balance to party b and party b agreed to receive such accounts receivable balance from customer a on behalf of the company to offset against its trade payable due to the company pursuant to the terms of the triparties settlement arrangement among customer a party b and us  customer a agrees to make cash payments directly to the designated bank accounts of party b per our monthly instruction under this arrangement we can assure the collection from customer a to meet with the purchase payable due to party b on a timely basis we also can reduce the time and costs to handle the fund remittance among customer a party b and ourselves as we continue to make the purchase orders to party b the accounts receivable originally due from customer a will be gradually eliminated and offset by our future accounts payable due to party b we have developed a prolonged business relationship with party b in the sale and related products over years in the normal course of business party b is acting as a customer or a vendor who generally sells and buys different types of wood products to and from us on an armlength basis these sale and purchases transactions are independent we expect to sustain and continue this prolonged business relationship with party b because  party b has a longterm commercial history and experience in sale and procurement of wood products in china we believe that there is no collectability concern with regard to the accounts receivable balance due from party b which will be recoverable by our future purchase orders as of june   and march   there was no accounts receivable balance transferred from customer a to party b as of june   and march   the aging analysis of party b is as follow as of june   march    days      days    days    days   over  days     less allowance for doubtful accounts     total     trends we are not aware of any trends events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our shortterm or longterm liquidity inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material or significant impact on our revenue or our results of operations working capital our working capital was  and  on june   and march   respectively we currently generate our cash flow through our operations we believe that our cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next  months  there is no identifiable expansion plan as of june   but from time to time we may identify new business opportunities to improve the profitability and working capital from operations capital resources as of june   the company has a revolving line of credit with dbs bank hong kong limited with an outstanding balance of  a revolving line of credit with industrial and commercial bank of china asia limited with an outstanding balance of  a short term bank borrowing with shanghai commercial bank with an outstanding balance of  and a trade financing payable to tai wah timber factory limited in an aggregate of  we will require additional fund if we were to expand our business the dbs bank hong kong limited dbs provides a credit facility for borrowings up to hk approximately  for up to  days generally with interest at i  per annum below prime rate for hong kong dollar bills and ii standard bills rate quoted by dbs from time to time for foreign currency bills on the outstanding amount from drawdown until

financing arrangement the financing arrangement with tai wah timber factory limited provides for borrowings with interest rate at  per annum and the interest is required to pay monthly as of june  and march   the outstanding balance was  and  respectively while the capital resources of the company are stable from a cash perspective the credit of the company for debt financing if necessary is extremely strong due to our strong banking relations and the credit facilities provided for our veneer products from time to time we do have a need to exercise our credit options on a short term basis due to the nature of our business as importersexporters the company has established lines of credit with banks and management maintains very strong relations with these banks management believes that its current lines of credit are more than sufficient to cover any short and long term liquidity needs our historical financial liquidity needs have been shown to be more than adequately covered by our credit facilities we believe that the strength of our management team to maintain strict internal control of its cash flow and liquidity that the current credit facilities are adequate for our needs our accounts receivable balance as of june   is  our accounts receivable are not considered by management to be high due to the nature of payment for our products our clients are required to provide credit facilities for their product by a letter of credit or other negotiable method of payment for the amount owed we draw from the letter of credit prior to delivery only in the event that it is needed to maintain sufficient cash flow to cover our operations we pay the cost of drawing on any letter of credit because our cash flow is typically sufficient to cover our operations we do not carry accounts receivable unless prior arrangements have been made it is company policy to recognize revenue when the product is shipped to our customers in the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business efforts or if the company is pursued by a larger company for a business combination we will analyze all strategies to continue the company and increase shareholder value only under these circumstances would we consider a merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance a rollup or other business combination to increase business and potentially increase the shareholder value of the company management believes its responsibility to increase shareholder value is of paramount importance which means the company should consider the aforementioned alternatives
