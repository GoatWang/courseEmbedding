the us military academy at west point after receiving his bachelor of science in management he spent  years in the us army his service included a fouryear tour in germany in cavalry and engineering units three years as an associate professor in the department of mathematics at the military academy and two years as the army program representative to raytheon while teaching at west point he also served as a social aide to president ronald reagan and earned his professional engineer’s license pe in industrial engineering in addition to his qualifications as an army ranger sandbrook earned four

college and a master of arts in international relations from salve regina university he joined tilcon new york as vice president in  and became president and ceo three years later in recognition of his efforts at ground zero after the september th bombing of the world trade center he was named the rockland county ny  business leader of the year the dominican college  man of the year and the american red cross  man of the year for southern new york sandbrook was appointed president of oldcastle materials’ west division in  in july  he was promoted to ceo of oldcastle architectural in june  he was named ceo of oldcastle’s americas products  distribution and in  president and ceo of us concrete inc company brief us concrete inc nasdaq uscr usconcretecom serves the construction industry in several major markets in the united states through its two business segments readymixed concrete and aggregates products the company has  standard readymixed concrete plants  volumetric readymixed concrete facilities and  producing aggregates facilities during  us concrete sold approximately  million cubic yards of readymixed concrete and approximately  million tons of aggregates will you touch on the history of us concrete the company was founded in the late s as a rollup of readymix businesses familyowned businesses were acquired throughout the country but especially in new york city in addition to readymix the company also had operations in precast concrete and concrete blocks which are lowmargin businesses because they never established a disciplined strategy they were unable to build out significant market positions in the sectors they operated in and they weren’t well capitalized things peaked in  and building came to a halt the debt couldn’t be serviced and the company filed for bankruptcy in  i started in my role in august  with a defeated team that hadn’t had bonuses or pay raises in a number of years and with a company that hadn’t had any capital spend in three to four years there was a lot of talent that permeated throughout our organization and i knew i could get the company back on track but in order to do that i needed to win the trust of our employees therefore i spent over  percent of my time on the road my first year traveling the country to meet with as many managers and employees as i could and listen to their concerns part of being a great leader is listening more than you talk and those first  days opened my eyes to a lot what i found was that the company suffered from a culture of a lack of accountability where everything was micromanaged and very seasoned operating managers were not allowed to make even minor operational decisions on things like fixing equipment all decisions were centralized in the corporate office in houston and were made by financial guys who were more comfortable on wall street than in a concrete plant i knew that first and foremost to turn things around i needed to reinstitute the principle of accountability and empower our employees to make their own decisions i wanted our people to know that it was okay for them to get their equipment fixed and that they would know when they needed to ask my permission it was a bit of an adjustment at first but over time they grew more and more comfortable now the employees would be held responsible for their decisions which had a substantial positive impact on their own performance as well as the company’s another thing that i did not particularly care for was the location of our company headquarters in houston which was  miles away from our nearest concrete plant towards the end of my first year i struck a deal with the city of euless which is just outside of dallas to relocate our corporate office the city gave us incentives which in effect has made our new home a profit center and the move also made a difference from a cultural perspective our staff was now able to walk across the building and see a dispatch office where we’re running the business out of i also implemented a more disciplined approach to our operations and sold off our precast concrete and concrete block businesses we then took the proceeds from those dispositions and made our first acquisition of a readymix business in san francisco that acquisition had a profound positive effect on employee morale knowing that just one year earlier they were faced with losing their jobs and now they were working for an organization that was buying when no one else was to date we have made more than  acquisitions and this has solidified our ability to service large metropolitan areas and to partake of building booms in areas like san francisco new york and dallas is innovation taking place in this industry for some readymix companies yes the readymix that we produced for  park the tallest residential tower in the western hemisphere was a very specialized blend of concrete that needed very innovative chemical admixtures specialty rocks and special formulations that hadn’t been done before and no one even knew if it could be done the ability to consistently use technology and innovation in materials is far advanced from where it was years ago how hard is it to differentiate in this space we can differentiate based on quality we have a dedicated rd lab in san jose staffed to bring out innovative products primarily in the green space california is really focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain we are able to do that in our space by taking cement out of concrete while keeping the same structural characteristics we substitute things like fly ash to reduce the energy our kilns use in manufacturing cement which reduces greenhouse gases we now lead in low co production• click here to download a
