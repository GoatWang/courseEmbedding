are sometimes unable to maintain an nav at  per share and as it is generally referred to break the buck in that event an investor in a money market fund would upon redemption receive less than  per share the portfolios shareholders should not rely on or expect an affiliate of the portfolio to purchase distressed assets from the portfolio make capital infusions enter into credit support agreements or take other actions to prevent the portfolio from breaking the buck in addition you should be aware that significant redemptions by large investors in the portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the portfolios other shareholders the portfolios nav could be affected by forced selling during periods of high redemption pressures andor illiquid markets money market funds are also subject to regulatory risk    under recently adopted changes to rule a the portfolio is permitted but not required at the discretion of the portfolios board of directors under certain circumstances of impaired liquidity of the portfolios investments to impose liquidity fees of up to  on or suspend redemptions for limited periods of time the portfolios board of directors has determined not to impose liquidity fees on or suspend redemptions under any circumstances      interest rate risk changes in interest rates will affect the yield and value of the portfolios investments in shortterm securities a decline in interest rates will affect the portfolios yield as these securities mature or are sold and the portfolio purchases new shortterm securities with lower yields generally an increase in interest rates causes the value of a debt instrument to decrease the change in value for shorterterm securities is usually smaller than for securities with longer

regarding fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that the portfolio would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date us gaap establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability including those valued based on their market values inputs may be observable or unobservable and refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the portfolio unobservable inputs reflect the portfolios own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances each investment is assigned a level based upon the observability of the inputs which are significant to the overall valuation the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below        level quoted prices in active markets for identical investments      level other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc      level significant unobservable inputs including the portfolios own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the fair value of debt instruments such as bonds and overthecounter derivatives is generally based on market price quotations recently executed market transactions where observable or industry recognized modeling techniques and are generally classified as level  pricing vendor inputs to level  valuations may include quoted prices for similar investments in active markets interest rate curves coupon rates currency rates yield curves option adjusted spreads default rates credit spreads and other unique security features in order to estimate the relevant cash flows which is then discounted to calculate fair values if these inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value these investments will be classified as level  in addition nonagency rated investments are classified as level  other fixed income investments including nonus government and corporate debt are generally valued using quoted market prices if available which are typically impacted by current interest rates maturity dates and any perceived credit risk of the issuer additionally in the absence of quoted market prices these inputs are used by pricing vendors to derive a valuation based upon industry or proprietary models which incorporate issuer specific data with relevant yieldspread comparisons with more widely quoted bonds with similar key characteristics those investments for which there are observable inputs are classified as level  where the inputs are not observable the investments are classified as level  the following table summarizes the valuation of the portfolios investments by the above fair value

a there were no transfers between any levels during the reporting period the portfolio recognizes all transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy assuming the financial instruments were transferred at the beginning of the reporting period the adviser established the valuation committee the committee to oversee the pricing and valuation of all securities held in the portfolio the committee operates under pricing and valuation policies and procedures established by the adviser and approved by the board including pricing policies which set forth the mechanisms and processes to be employed on a daily basis to implement these policies and procedures in particular the pricing policies describe how to determine market quotations for securities and other instruments the committees responsibilities include  fair value and liquidity determinations and oversight of any third parties to whom any responsibility for fair value and liquidity determinations is delegated and  regular monitoring of the advisers pricing and valuation policies and procedures and modification or enhancement of these policies and procedures or recommendation of the modification of these policies and procedures as the committee believes appropriate the committee is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of the pricing policies by the advisers pricing group the pricing group and a third party which performs certain pricing functions in accordance with the pricing policies the pricing group is responsible for the oversight of the third party on a daytoday basis the committee and the pricing group perform a series of activities to provide reasonable assurance of the accuracy of prices including  periodic vendor due diligence meetings review of methodologies new developments and process at vendors  daily compare of security valuation versus prior day for all securities that exceeded established thresholds and  daily review of unpriced stale and variance reports with exceptions reviewed by senior management and the committee in addition several processes outside of the pricing process are used to monitor valuation issues including  performance and performance attribution reports are monitored for anomalous impacts based upon benchmark performance and  portfolio managers review all portfolios for performance and analytics which are generated
