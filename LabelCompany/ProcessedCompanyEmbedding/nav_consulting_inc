on sql server for more than three years i was both surprised and quite impressed with the volume and quality of information presented in this brief four hour training session  cory power from archerpoint a true dynamics nav professional with expert teaching skills did an outstanding job of packing in quite a few critical topics such as installation configuration an indepth presentation of sql server management studio database and security optimization and the creation and execution of tsql scripts – all aimed at ensuring that all those in attendance had a solid understanding about important considerations for the dynamics nav sql environment  at the conclusion of this one training seminar i had not only a better understanding of my sql environment but also was able to develop a list of areas that required attention and further work to improve overall system performance saving our company not only time and money but resulted in helping our end users to do their job more efficiently and effectively  this training seminar was definitely worth the investment and dovetailed very nicely into the followon four hour training session on security i am looking forward to

on sql server for more than three years i was both surprised and quite impressed with the volume and quality of information presented in this brief four hour training session  cory power from archerpoint a true dynamics nav professional with expert teaching skills did an outstanding job of packing in quite a few critical topics such as installation configuration an indepth presentation of sql server management studio database and security optimization and the creation and execution of tsql scripts – all aimed at ensuring that all those in attendance had a solid understanding about important considerations for the dynamics nav sql environment  at the conclusion of this one training seminar i had not only a better understanding of my sql environment but also was able to develop a list of areas that required attention and further work to improve overall system performance saving our company not only time and money but resulted in helping our end users to do their job more efficiently and effectively  this training seminar was definitely worth the investment and dovetailed very nicely into the followon four hour training session on security i am looking forward to
