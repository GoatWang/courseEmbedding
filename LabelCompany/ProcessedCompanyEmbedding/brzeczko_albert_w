g publication date  collection pubmed journals contributor taylor  francis language english volume  this article is from the american journal of drug and alcohol abuse volume abstractbackground the personal and societal effects of methamphetamine abuse are well documented the ease of accessibility to methamphetamine and the quality of the “high” it produces makes the drug highly desired by its abusers over time many methamphetamine users will also become methamphetamine cooks where pseudoephedrine in overthecounter cold products is converted to methamphetamine through a simple albeit extremely dangerous process new laws limiting access to these products have had limited success no existing commercial pseudoephedrine products offer significant impediments to slow or limit the extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories objective and methods a new pseudoephedrine  mg tablet product using impede technology nexafed® to deter methamphetamine production has recently been introduced into the marketplace using methods designed to mimic clandestine laboratory processes the ability of this product to disrupt extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine yet provide therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated results impede™ technology tablets limited the extraction andor conversion of pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine when compared to a commercially marketed pseudoephedrine product sudafed® nexafed® tablets were also shown to be bioequivalent to the same control product thus ensuring therapeutic equivalence conclusions with the advent of new pseudoephedrine products in the marketplace with features to limit the extraction and conversion of pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine new tools are now available to minimize the clandestine manufacture of the drug and potentially limit its social impact identifier pubmedpmc identifierark arktrcm issn  print  electronic journaltitle the american
