appliancesview moreappliances that make your life easierits a fact of life that at some point one or more of the appliances in your home is going to need to be replaced or perhaps youre outfitting a new home or apartment and starting from scratch this includes your large appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers as well as smaller appliances that make your time in the kitchen or when cleaning much simpler when these items are relatively new and hopefully covered under some kind of warranty it makes sense to get them repaired when they malfunction however there comes a time when you must decide to replace a failing appliance with a brand new or refurbished one and that is where we can help with low prices every day on everythingrefrigeratorssimilar to a vehicle or other largescale appliances it pays to know what to look for when choosing a refrigerator for your kitchen or other spot in your home for example with refrigerators it pays to know what to look for such as how many doors you want where you want the freezer to be situated whether you want an external ice maker water dispenser and amenities designed to keep your food fresher for longer periods of time size is a major consideration as our refrigerators run as small as  cubic feet which are ideal for offices dorm rooms and man caves to  cubic feet or more for fullsize units other considerations such as color width brand and energy star rating are important as welltoastersthe same care when choosing a large appliance should be done for smaller appliances as well for example it seems almost expected for a toaster to work forever and most do last a long time however if you have recently moved and are trying to match a certain color scheme or simply want to upgrade to the latest technology there are important things to consider when selecting a toaster too for example do you want it to be a twoslice or fourslice toaster should it have manual timing or digital and should it be a certain color or does stainless steel work with your decor you could even choose a toaster oven that doubles as a toaster giving you an appliance that does double duty in your kitchenmicrowavesspeaking of versatile appliances none are more versatile in the kitchen than microwave ovens these devices have come a long way from the days of the radar range microwaves not only reheat your food and beverages with electromagnetic waves in other words microwaves but many also offer convection capabilities as well no longer are they just for popping popcorn or heating tv dinners now you can cook entire meals with just a microwave and do other tasks as well such as defrosting frozen food and softening butter microwaves typically are available in three forms countertop overtherange and builtin again there are factors to consider regarding your choice of microwave and we have many from which you can choose we have units that are small having a cooking space of  cubic feet or less to  cubic feet or more wattage is another consideration and we have models that range from less than  watts to more than  watts  the higher the wattage the quicker your foods are heated essentiallywashers and dryersappliances arent exclusive to your kitchen many people like the convenience of having their own washing machine and dryer rather than making trips to the laundromat or onsite laundry facility we can help with these choices as well for example apartment dwellers who dont have room for a traditionalsized washer and dryer can select allinone units that work side by side stack on top of each other or portable units that are usable on a countertop for standard washers and dryers considerations include toploading or frontloading capacity overall size and brandvacuum cleanersanother appliance that is often overlooked until it malfunctions is a vacuum cleaner there have been many advances made in the making of vacuum cleaners and it is not just limited to style the variations here range from canister uprights stick and even handheld and robotic vacuum cleaners there are also units that are ideal for doing deep carpet cleanings including extractors sometimes known as steam machines and shampooers there are even some vacuums specific to picking up pet hair and dander for the doityourselfer there are also wetdry vacuums that are ideal for working in the garage shop or anywhere there is a need to vacuum up heavyduty materials or liquids important considerations for vacuum cleaners focus on the surfaces to be cleaned whether the unit is bagless or not height color and available accessories we feature many brands of vacuum cleaners and finding one that is ideal for your space is simpleair conditionersone appliance that is crucial to upping the comfort level of your home is an air conditioner although many people live in homes with central air conditioning many do not and that is where we can help we offer units that fit snugly in a window and can keep several rooms cool at one time and portable air conditioners ideal for keeping a single room at the desired temperature factors to consider when choosing an air conditioner include the coverage area to be cooled the size of the space if choosing a window unit and the number of btus the unit possesses btus refers to the amount of heat an air conditioner can remove from a room per hour with up to  btus recommended for small rooms  square feet and  btus for covering  square feet as with most products of this nature be sure to look for the energy star label to ensure you are getting a unit that

states every year because epoxy quickly sets inside the nozzle and plugs it the nozzle technology has changed little since the s ronning says ronning had his “eureka” moment while listening to professor tim osswald discuss the shortcomings of static mixers in a class on plastics at uw–madison sample competitor mixing nozzles are pictured at the re mixers inc photo jeff miller as he pondered the problem of quickly and thoroughly mixing two fluids he realized that the problem was more interesting than it sounds “mixing is such a fundamental basic action but what is the most efficient way to do it  with a static mixer there are not many factors to play with not many tricks to employ” mixing whether active or static is something that yearolds enjoy ronning says “it’s a natural process if you are standing in a river and gently release a handful of sand you can expect all of the individual grains to be dispersed as they flow downstream but aside from the water itself there aren’t any moving components along the riverbed that’s a good way to envision what happens inside a static mixing nozzle where there also aren’t any moving components” static mixing and epoxy adhesive are critical to strong lightweight construction in laptops cellphones cars and bikes ronning says “these products could not exist in their present form without static mixers and the adhesives they make possible” in the world of products epoxy adhesive enabled by static mixers “is in everything we see” ronning says “but it’s not where you’re looking your computer your phone your car your house — epoxy is everywhere but it’s behind the scenes and every time a nozzle plugs up with epoxy a new nozzle must be used” to convert a eureka moment into a business ronning and brian pekron a fellow engineering student at uw–madison entered the discovery to product program on campus a  grant from dp was devoted to product development testing of prototypes identifying customers and forming a company “dp helped us realize a business strategy that was realistic which is vital when starting any venture” ronning says pekron left and ronning make adjustments to an automated testing device photo jeff miller in december re mixers received initial funding of  from n capital partners of manitowish waters wisconsin “i have been really impressed with re mixers’ adhesive and epoxy mixing technology” says carl ruedebusch head of n  “being a contractor this is a technical area that i know well” the new design provides better mixing of the ingredients while dramatically reducing the amount of expensive material wasted when the epoxy hardens inside the nozzle by improving bond strength better mixing further cuts adhesive cost re mixers has filed a patent on the invention which ronning will not describe in detail at this point however like existing static mixers he says it depends on a principle called the “baker’s transformation which is a fancy way to describe how a baker kneads flour and liquid to make dough by stretching and folding over and over” existing static mixers effectively double the mixing action with each folding re mixers has figured out a fundamentally different folding action that results in a much more efficient mixing so each fold is an order of magnitude more effective ronning says at their office at the sector makerspace in madison pekron and ronning have worked to refine the revolutionary shape that ronning envisioned back in the engineering class they built a robotic testing apparatus to measure bond strength for different nozzle designs the final shape increases bond strength by  to  percent over current designs ronning says but the primary advantage comes from mixing efficiency which allows a shorter nozzle to mix better than existing nozzles as a result less expensive epoxy is wasted when the nozzle inevitably plugs as the epoxy sets inside it “our big selling point is reducing adhesive cost for the end user” says ronning “and at the same time they get a stronger adhesive“ ronning and pekron hope to be on the market with their product within a year beyond epoxy ronning says the development process could apply more broadly to the problem of industrial mixing applications “this shape was developed by a genetic algorithm and experimentation with each design the algorithm looked at the performance of the bond then we ran another iteration and went through that  times so we have developed a process that could be applied to all forms of chemical mixing” tags discovery to product engineering spinoffs you may also

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
