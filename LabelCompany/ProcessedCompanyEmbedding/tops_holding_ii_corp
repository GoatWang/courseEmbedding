partially offset by an  million decrease in sales attributable to  instore pharmacies closed in january   same store sales which exclude the sales of the  closed instore pharmacies decreased  in the fourth quarter of  on a comparable week comparison  fuel sales were negatively impacted by a  decline in the average retail price per gallon and as a result were  million in the fourth quarter a

corporate fuel stations were in operation  overall net sales increased  million or  to  million gross profit for the fourth quarter was  million or  of net sales compared with  million or  of net sales in the  fourth quarter  the  basis point increase in gross margin reflects higher profitability on fuel sales and product mix due to a smaller proportion of relatively lower margin fuel sales  the improvement also reflects savings associated with the amendment of certain operating terms of our procurement agreement with cs wholesale grocers inc effective april    total operating expenses

number of gallons sold  overall fiscal  net sales were  billion down  million or  from the prioryear period  gross profit increased  million to  million and was  of net sales up  basis points over the  period  the increase in gross profit and margin reflects similar items as the fourth quarter as well as an improvement in noncash lifo inventory valuation adjustments   the amended operating terms of our cs procurement agreement resulted in total savings of  million in fiscal  of which  million was recorded in distribution costs and  million in cost of goods sold    operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  in fiscal  and  respectively  the  period included an increase in the new york state minimum wage an increase in bonus expense of  million and  million of legal and
