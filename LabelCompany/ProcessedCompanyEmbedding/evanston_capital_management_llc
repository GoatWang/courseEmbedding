strategies and the impact of data mining and arbitrage on historical backtests when attempting to calculate accurate forwardlooking return estimates for such strategies the key identifying assumption for the particular smart betas and time periods analyzed is motivated by nobel laureate eugene fama’s famous  efficient capital markets survey paper ie “efficient capital markets ii” pete hecht senior investment strategist analyzed both backtested and actual performance data over a yearperiod and found that all of the performance metrics decreased during the outofsample period the outofsample performance reductions ranged from  to 7 suggesting that data mining and arbitrage play a material economically significant role in performance expectations  download the report fact or fiction stocks and bonds are less risky for longterm investors conventional wisdom suggests that longterm investors face less investment risk thus impacting their strategic asset allocation while there are many reasons for risk to vary with investment horizon the typical explanations eg time diversification are misguided this new research piece provides a framework for evaluating risk at different investment

discussed  download the report risk parity is not a hedge fund strategy  other common risk parity misperceptions over the past few years risk parity has become a component of most investors’ lexicon and possibly portfolios risk parity products have also become more common in many asset management firms’ offerings however even with all of the attention on risk parity there is still a significant amount of confusion surrounding it this piece will examine some of the common risk parity misperceptions and provides an alternative clarifying explanation  download the report hedge fund replication is it appropriate for you recognizing the investment community’s significant interest in hedge fund replication and related topics such as alternative beta the report takes an indepth look at these complex attempts to mimic the core risk and return properties of certain hedge fund strategies within a more accessible investment form than traditional hedge fund investing the paper discusses the two primary types of replication “top down” and “bottom up” reviews how replication can help improve manager underwriting and monitoring looks at the issue of liquidity rights and discusses expected

landscape on the capital allocators podcast hosted by ted seides pete hecht wants investors to measure alpha not just tout it mar   alpha all hedge fund managers claim they have it evanston capitals senior investment strategist pete hecht phd knows that few of them actually do and he’s focused on keeping them honest about it episode 7 with pete hecht  accredited investor markets mar   senior investment strategist pete hecht phd and accredited investor markets radio host chris cahill go beyond the hype and have an honest discussion on the topic of liquid alternatives begins around minute  correlation – just one leg of the investment stool feb   why isn’t global tactical asset allocation gtaa  global macro the obvious hedge fund strategy for a typical institutional investor compared to a diversified hedge fund program it presents a lower stockbond correlation and doesn’t everyone say the whole point of a portfolio is to assemble uncorrelated return streams should you fire your risk parity manager feb   risk parity strategies came under pressure in  as markets sold off risk en masse and asset classes fell across the board the performance was a reminder that the strategy which relies on diversification across equities fixed income emerging markets commodities etc and then using leverage to boost returns from a relatively diluted basket of components is inherently tied to beta not alpha however the idea behind risk parity remains a sound one over long periods of time writes peter hecht of evanston capital management as long as investors remember what it is and what it is not longterm investors averse to permanent loss of capital owe volatility an apology dec   defining and measuring risk is foundational to investment management although there are many legitimate risk measures available todays discussion will focus on volatility why first volatility is the easiest to understand and happens to be the “work horse” of applied modern portfolio theory which is why its taught in every classroom and continuously discussed on financial market channels such as cnbc and bloomberg secondly and more importantly volatility is unfairly under assault by many smart investors focused on the long term and averse to a permanent loss of capital unhedged commentary clearing up confusion around risk parity and market selloffs sep   it seems as though just about everyone in the investment community has pontificated on the role that risk parity strategies play in market sell¬offs like the one in august unfortunately many of the views are coming from possibly uninformed or biased parties creating confusion and the need for clarification i’d like to move the debate forward by focusing on the key risk parity portfolio construction technique possibly contributing to market sell¬offs volatility targeting to understand the recent debate in the media you need to understand volatility targeting and how it is used by risk parity managers are you properly evaluating your hedge fund manager’s performance sep   history provides so many opportunities for learning – even for hedge funds and their investors rewind in  and  hedge funds were criticized for not keeping up with the sp  fast forward to the present time in august  despite the average hedge fund outperforming the sp  hedge funds were still criticized for losing money in aggregate while simultaneously being congratulated for finally making money on their short books what does this all mean in my opinion confusion people are still confused about how to evaluate hedge fund managers or any active manager and the concepts involved are foundational to investment management how hedge fund long positions show skill while losing money in august sep   august was a tough month for financial markets the sp  was down over  and with respect to hedge funds the typical hedge fund lost money in august conventional wisdom criticized manager long positions and praised short positions but losses on the long book often overwhelmed the gains on the short book did hedge funds fail not necessarily but it does represent a teachable moment global tactical asset allocation gtaa – a complement not a substitute aug   let me be clear i support thoughtfully implemented global tactical asset allocation “gtaa”global macro strategies but gtaaglobal macro strategies aren’t a catchall for building an alternatives allocation let alone a substitute for a diversified hedge fund program sightings of this errant substitution started a few years back and have become more commonplace as the “liquid alternatives” segment has increased in popularity but it needs to stop why wealth managers should take a look at endowments jul   can a registered investment adviser ria construct a portfolio structured along the lines of the endowment model a good place to start to answer this question would be with another question if you could do it why would you want to  things to consider before pursuing a strategic asset allocation jul   at a conference i attended recently the question “do you have too much equity risk” came up during a risk parity discussion one of the investors said his portfolio wasnt over allocated to equity risk since he had a longterm investment horizon his claim equities are less risky for longterm investors he reasoned that with a long enough investment horizon the good and bad return years cancel each other out leaving the investor with an almost guaranteed return this logic resonated with many of the other conference attendees new tactics boost big fundoffunds managers may   hoboken nj  the combined assets of the  largest fundoffunds managers grew at a faster rate than the multimanager sector as a whole last year finally a practical solution for decomposing returns into alpha and beta apr   for an industry that uses the word “alpha” like its going out of style i find it amazing the asset management profession has made so little progress when it comes to actually trying to measure it in practice given its importance to active management no alpha  no active management industry and given all of the verbal airtime “alpha” receives you would think managers and investors would spend a healthy amount of time trying to actually measure it on a regular basis unfortunately this is not the case how to evaluate hedge funds the underutilised measure of consistent alpha dec   benchmarking hedge funds can be challenging but as a former finance professor i experience heartburn every time i hear the investment community criticize hedge funds for not keeping up with the sp  it is the same type of heartburn i felt when investors thought hedge funds demonstrated skill when they outperformed the sp  in  both
