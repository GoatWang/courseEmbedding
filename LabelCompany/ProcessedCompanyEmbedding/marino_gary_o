layton  finger pa wilmington delaware charles bachman omelveny  myers llp new york new york counsel for defendant patriot rail company llc opinionplaintiff gary o marino seeks advancements of fees and expenses from defendant patriot rail company llc the “company”  the parties have crossmoved for summary judgment  marinos motion is granted  the companys motion is deniedi factual backgroundthe facts are drawn from the affidavits and supporting documents that the parties submitted in connection with their motions for summary judgment  the parties agreed in their briefs and at oral argument that there were no disputes of material fact that would affect the outcome  pursuant to court of chancery rule h the crossmotions therefore became “the equivalent of a stipulation for decision on the merits based on the record submitted with the motions”  ct ch r ha marino and the companyfrom  until june   marino served as chairman president and ceo of the company  he indirectly owned  of its equity  patriot rail holdings llc “parent” owned all of the stock of the company  patriot rail llc “grandparent” owned all of the member interests of parent  patriot equity llc “great–grandparent” owned  of the member interests of grandparent and served as its managing member  marino owned  of great–grandparentmarino previously owned another  of grandparent which he held either directly or through great–grandparent  at some point he transferred those interests to the marino family dynasty trust for no consideration  together marino and the marino family dynasty trust owned nearly  of the member interests in grandparent     the company operates shortline and regional freight railroads throughout north america  the company remained a delaware corporation until may   when it converted into an llc the conversion did not affect its liabilities or obligations  see  del c § eb the companys involvement with sierranonparty sierra railroad company provides railroadrelated services  at various points marino discussed the possibility of the company acquiring sierra with sierras management team  as part of those discussions the company and sierra entered into a nondisclosure agreement dated september  sierra had a contract with mcclellan business park to provide rail switching services the “switching contract”  it was scheduled to expire on february    in  as part of the periodic discussions about a business combination sierra provided the company with confidential information about the switching contract  at the time sierra was negotiating with mcclellan to extend the switching contract  to reassure mcclellan that sierra had an industry partner that could back sierra in fulfilling an extended agreement sierra took marino and other company employees to meet with mcclellan representativesmcclellan decided not to extend the switching contract and instead issued a request for proposals  both sierra and the company submitted bids  in january  mcclellan awarded the contract to the companyc the first california lawsuitin march  sierra sued the company in the united states district court for the eastern district of california the “california court”  sierras complaint included claims for breach of the nondisclosure agreement misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with prospective business relationshipslater in march  the company and sierra entered into a letter of intent for an asset purchase  sierra dismissed its claims without prejudice the same day  but negotiations broke down and the deal did not closed the underlying actionon december   the company filed suit against sierra in the california court for breaching the letter of intent  sierra filed counterclaims including the claims it previously had dismissed without prejudice plus a new claim that the company had breached the letter of intent  this decision refers to the proceedings in the california court as the “underlying action”in february  sierra filed an amended pleading that sought to add parent grandparent and great–grandparent to the litigation  sierra did not serve parent or great–grandparent  the company and grandparent filed answers  parent and great–grandparent did not appeare the intervening stock sale and fund transfersin  while the underlying action was pending patriot funding llc the “buyer” purchased  of the companys stock from parent the “stock sale”  the transaction was governed by a stock purchase agreement dated may   the “stock purchase agreement” or “spa”  the stock sale closed on june    effective upon closing marino resigned from all of his positions with the companybuyer paid parent  million for the stock of the company  not surprisingly the parties to the stock sale bargained over the underlying action and allocated the risk of an adverse outcome in the stock purchase agreement  the stock purchase agreement created a special indemnification procedure for claims related to the underlying action secured by an escrow fund of  million  see spa § b  spa ex d the governing agreements called for up to  million to be released from the escrow fund to parent one year after closing  see spa ex d § c  if the underlying action was not yet resolved at that point the remaining  million would remain in escrow until its conclusionover the course of three distributions parent transferred  million of net sale proceeds to the investors in grandparent collectively the “fund transfers”  the first transfer occurred on the date the stock sale closed  the second happened on february    the third happened on august    according to sierra marino and the marino dynasty trust received approximately  millionin the ordinary course each distribution would have been made from parent to grandparent then grandparent would have distributed the funds to its investors  sierra alleges parent used different mechanisms to transfer funds to marino the marino dynasty trust and other investors in grandparent because grandparent was a defendant in the underlying action and marino did not want the funds flowing through its accountsf the pre–judgment hearingin march  sierra moved for leave to serve parent and great–grandparent with its claims and bring them into the case as parties  sierra argued that it needed parent and great–grandparent in the case to protect its ability to collect on a potential judgmentin june  the company represented to the california court that it would not take any steps to render itself judgmentproof  relying on the companys representations the california court denied sierras motion  the california court observed that if necessary sierra could “move post trial to substitute appropriate parties to effect judgment”  dkt  ex at g the california judgment and the post–judgment motionthe underlying action proceeded to trial  on march   a jury awarded compensatory damages of  million in favor of sierra and against the company and grandparent  on may  the jury awarded punitive damages of  million in favor of sierra and against the company plus  million in favor of sierra and against grandparent  on october  the california court awarded additional exemplary damages of  million in favor of sierra and against the company  the california court did not award additional exemplary damages against grandparent because it had “no ability to pay”  id at   this decision refers to these awards collectively as the “california judgment”on july   sierra moved to amend the california judgment to add marino parent and great–grandparent as judgment debtors  on january   sierra filed its amended motion the “post–judgment motion”  sierra contended that the post–judgment motion was necessary because the company and grandparent had rendered themselves judgment proof  according to sierra during the bulk of the underlying action the company and grandparent had a combined net worth that ranged from  million to  million  by the time of trial however the company and grandparent had reduced their combined net worth to only  millionto add marino parent and great–grandparent as judgment debtors sierra relied on section  of the california code of civil procedurewhen jurisdiction is by the constitution or this code or by any other statute conferred on a court or judicial officer all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given  and in the exercise of this jurisdiction if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by this code or the statute any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this codecalcivproccode §   california decisions have interpreted section  to confer on a trial court the general equitable power to amend a judgment to add additional debtors who were alter egos of parties already liable under the judgment and who controlled the litigation that resulted in the judgment the california court has not yet ruled on the post–judgment motion  consistent with cases applying section  sierra argues in the post–judgment motion that marino should be added as a judgment debtor because i he was involved in the conduct that gave rise to the california judgment ii he controlled the company before the stock sale iii he deprived the company of assets that it could use to pay the california judgment and iv he directed the companys defense in the underlying actionh this litigationby letter dated july   marinos counsel asked the company to advance the fees and expenses that marino would incur to oppose the post–judgment motion  marinos counsel regarded the post–judgment motion as a continuation of sierras claims in the underlying action which meant that the post–judgment motion related to actions that marino had taken while an officer and director of the companythe company saw things differently  by letter dated august   the company took the position that the post–judgment motion focused primarily on the fund transfers which took place when marino was no longer an officer or director of the companyby letter dated september   marinos counsel made another demand for advancements and marino provided a signed undertaking to repay any advancements he received if he was not ultimately entitled to indemnification  the company again denied his requeston october   marino commenced this action  he sought advancements of attorneys fees and expenses for the claims asserted against him in the post–judgment motion  he also sought fees on fees to the extent he was successful in this action  the company answered and the parties crossmoved for summary judgmentii legal analysisarticle viii of the companys certificate of incorporation states  “this corporation shall indemnify and shall advance expenses on behalf of its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law in existence either now or hereafter”  through this provision the company bound itself to “advance expenses on behalf of” marino in his capacity as one “of its officers and directors”  once the stock sale closed however marino resigned from his positions with the company and ceased to be an officer or directorno one disputes that if marino had been sued by reason of his status as an officer or director while he was serving as an officer or director then the company would have been obligated to provide advancements  the dispute is about whether article viii continues to cover marino for the same types of claims now that he has ceased to be an officer or director  marino contends that he remains covered for claims challenging the propriety of actions he took while serving an officer and a director  the company contends that his coverage terminated when he ceased to be an officer or a directorbecause the companys charter contemplates advancement “to the fullest extent permitted by law” the answer turns on the language of the indemnification and advancement statute   del c §   three subsections of section  carry particular significance  i section e which authorizes advancements ii section j which addresses the extent to which a covered persons indemnification and advancement rights for actions taken during the persons period of service continue after the person has ceased to serve and iii section f which limits a corporations ability to cause a covered persons rights to terminate after the person has served in reliance upon thema section esection e of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” confers permissive authority on delaware corporations to grant advancements  it statesexpenses including attorneys fees incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any civil criminal administrative or investigative action suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section  such expenses including attorneys fees incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the corporation or by persons serving at the request of the corporation as directors officers employees or agents of another corporation partnership joint venture trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions if any as the corporation deems appropriate del c § elike other sections of delaware law that confer specific powers on an entity section e confirms that a delaware corporation has the authority to grant advancements  these specific grants eliminate any doubt about whether a particular power falls within the generalized grant of authority provided by section a of the dgcl which confers on a delaware corporation its officers directors and stockholders “all the powers and privileges granted by this chapter or by any other law or by its certificate of incorporation together with any powers incidental thereto so far as such powers and privileges are necessary or convenient to the conduct promotion or attainment of the business or purposes set forth in its certificate of incorporation”   del c § ain framing the scope of the statutory authority for advancements section e distinguishes between “an officer or director of the corporation” and “former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the corporation or by persons serving at the request of the corporation as directors officers employees or agents of another entity”  for “an officer or director of the corporation” section e authorizes the corporation to provide advancements “upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section”  for other persons section e authorizes the corporation to provide advancements “upon such terms and conditions if any as the corporation deems appropriate”the company makes much of this distinction which it says demonstrates that the unqualified term “officers and directors” only means currently serving officers and directors  based on this reading the company interprets its charter provision as granting advancement rights only to individuals who are currently serving as officers and directors at the time of the litigation  as the company sees it once those individuals ceased to be officers and directors they became former officers and directors and no longer had indemnification or advancement rights  marino understands the provision differently  he believes that he was covered while serving as an officer and director and that he continues to have coverage for the time during which he served as an officer and director  his coverage may have terminated prospectively because from that point on he was a former officer and director but it did not disappear retrospectively for the period of time when he previously servedsection  addresses this issue but the answer is not found in section e  two other subsections speak to whether existing indemnification and advancement rights continue after an individual has ceased to serve  section j addresses the continuation question directly and provides that the rights continue unless the governing provision stated expressly that they would terminate  see part iib infra  section f addresses the related issue of whether a corporation can cause a director or officers coverage to terminate after the individual has served in reliance on it by amending or altering the governing provisions  see part iic infrahistory teaches that section e singles out current officers and directors in its first sentence for a different reason  during the  revision to the dgcl which birthed section e substantially in its modern form the drafting committee wanted to signal that current officers and directors could receive advancements conditioned only on an unsecured undertaking and that a decision to grant advancements on that basis should not be subject to challenge  at the time prominent voices argued that statutory grants of specific authority should displace equitable review and the same drafters introduced specific statutory standards for approving relatedparty transactions  see  del c §   viewed in context these grants of authority suggest a desire to supplant fiduciary review as litigators subsequently argued it made particular sense for the drafters to strive for a statutory safe harbor for advancements to current officers and directors because a court of chancery decision from  had questioned how current directors could advance themselves funds “before final disposition of the action”  essential enters  corp v dorsey corp  ad   del ch seitz c  professor ernest l folk iii who was the reporter for the  revision explained that section e responded in significant part to essential enterprises  see folk supra at   a grant of advancements to current officers and directors also would fall within the literal language of section  which encompassed any “contract or transaction between a corporation and  or more of its directors or officers”  the drafters of the  revision sought to eliminate uncertainty by having the first sentence of section e specifically authorize a corporation to provide advancements to thenserving directors and officers conditioned solely on an unsecured undertaking  the sentence arguably represented a legislative determination that advancing litigation expenses to current officers or directors on that basis was entirely fair by contrast there was no need for similar concern about granting advancements to former officers and directors or to other persons  granting advancements to them was not an interested transaction  absent additional facts that would implicate a higher standard of review the decision to provide advancements would be protected by the business judgment rule  the second sentence of section e therefore provided that a corporation could provide advancements to those individuals on terms the corporation “deems appropriate” ie in the boards business judgmentthe problem that the drafters sought to solve explains the superficially counterintuitive structure of section e  read literally the statute requires more before a corporation can provide advancements to “an officer or director of the corporation” because the first sentence requires an undertaking than it does for “former directors and officers” where the statute permits the corporation to provide advancements on whatever terms it “deems appropriate”  the drafters took this approach because they were trying to establish a legitimizing norm for granting advancements to current directors and officers so they needed to say where the floor was  advancements to others did not raise conflict issues so the drafters could leave the decision entirely to the board of directorsas delaware law has developed the courts have largely harmonized the two sections  decisions have recognized that a corporation can require more than just an undertaking before providing advancements to “an officer or director”  and a ruling by this court rejected the proposition that a discretionary grant of advancements to currently serving directors was not subject to fiduciary review see havens  wl  at   decisions similarly have recognized that although the second sentence of section e technically does not mention an undertaking the receipt of advancements carries with it an implicit obligation to repay them if the recipient ultimately is not entitled to indemnification  any substantive distinction between the two regimes has effectively disappearedpost– decisions by the delaware supreme court also rendered untenable the strongform contention that a statutory grant of authority necessarily foreclosed fiduciary review  perhaps most famously the delaware supreme court explained in  that “inequitable action does not become permissible simply because it is legally possible”  schnell v chris–craft indus inc  ad   del  in an arguably more significant albeit less heralded decision the delaware supreme court held in  that section  only addressed the statutory validity of an interested transaction  it did not foreclose fiduciary review  by the takeover wars of the s it was established doctrine that a challenged defensive measure first had to pass statutory muster then survive equitable scrutiny  recent delaware cases have cited adolf berles pithy axiom that corporate action is always “twice tested”  despite these subsequent judicial developments the separate sentences in section e remain  given the historical context surrounding section e i do not believe they were intended to do anything more than underscore the ability of current directors and officers to receive advancements after providing an unsecured undertaking  to my mind the separate sentences do not suggest anything about whether individuals who possess indemnification and advancement rights as directors or officers lose them when they cease to serve  section j is the statutory section that answers that question directly and to which this decision now turnsb section jsection j addresses what happens when an individual who is protected by indemnification or advancement rights while serving in a covered capacity ceases to serve in that capacity  it statesthe indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this section shall unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director officer employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs executors and administrators of such a person del c § j the “continuation clause”  unlike section e which is a permissive grant of authority that a corporation can make mandatory the continuation clause is a mandatory provision that requires an explicit optout “unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified”the continuation clause establishes a default rule that indemnification and advancement rights “shall ․ continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director officer employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs executors and administrators of such a person”  moreover the provision contemplates not only continuation for a living individual who has “ceased to be a director officer employee or agent” but also continuation for the benefit of the heirs executors and administrators of an individual who has in all senses “ceased to be”  far from implying that the rights to indemnification and advancement that protect a current director or officer cease when the individual leaves office and becomes a former director and officer the continuation clause says exactly the opposite  unless the right specifically stated otherwise when the coverage was authorized or ratified the protection continuessection j was not part of the  revisions to the dgcl the general assembly added this section in  in the postvan gorkom statutory package that included charterbased exculpation under section b  “the amendments were prompted by a growing awareness by members of the corporation law section of the delaware bar association that directors concerns about personal liability were causing delaware corporations to lose or to be unable to attract qualified men and women to serve on their boards”  black  sparks supra at before the  amendments section f included a statement to the effect that indemnification rights “shall ․ continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director officer employee or agent”  but section f more prominently addressed the degree to which indemnification rights under or granted pursuant to the statue were nonexclusive which had been a matter of considerable interest from  onward  the continuation language had not received similar attention  the  amendments removed the continuation concept from the nonexclusivity provisions shadow and gave it a statutory home of its own in section jthe plain and mandatory language of section j now states that when a person has served in a covered capacity and made decisions or taken actions that implicate indemnification or advancement rights then the coverage that person received in that capacity “shall ․ continue” unless the original grant of rights “otherwise provided”  this means that if a person serves as a director and makes a decision and if that person would be entitled to receive advancements in litigation over that decision while serving as a director then that persons rights to advancements “shall ․ continue” after that person “has ceased to be a director”  put differently if the person is sued over the decision after that person “has ceased to be a director” the person is still entitled to advancements because the rights that the person had when serving “shall continue”under the continuation clause the only way that a covered person loses coverage after having “ceased to be a director” is if the source of the coverage “otherwise provided when authorized or ratified”  for example an advancement right would terminate upon cessation of service if it said during the time when the director took the challenged action that “a director shall receive mandatory advancements while serving as a director but will no longer receive mandatory advancements after having ceased to be a director”by making clear that the operative scope of coverage is what existed “when authorized or ratified” section f focuses on the protection in effect during the covered persons period of service in this fashion the continuation clause operates in harmony with other subsections of section  that turn on the individuals capacity during the underlying events that led to the litigation rather than the individuals capacity at the time suit is ultimately filedsection a is illustrative  in authorizing indemnification for third party actions it statesa corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened pending or completed action suit or proceeding ․ by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director officer employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director officer employee or agent of another entity against expenses ․ actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful del c § a emphasis added  in this provision the phrase “is or was” does not create a distinction based on the individuals capacity at the time of suit  precisely the contrary the phrase eliminates that issue by authorizing indemnification in either case “is or was” and shifting the focus to the individuals capacity at the time of the events giving rise to the suit  for purposes of statutory authority capacity at the time of suit is irrelevant  the statute instead turns on whether the individual became involved in the litigation “by reason of” the individuals service in a covered capacity  consistent with the continuation clause section a grants authority to a corporation to indemnify a person who “is or was” a director for actions that they took while a director  the “was” compliments the default rule of the continuation clause which states that unless the indemnification or advancement right specifies otherwise coverage for actions taken while in a covered capacity continues after the person “has ceased” to serve in the covered capacityparallel usages of “is or was” appear in section b which authorizes indemnification for actions by or in the right of the corporation  id § b  to the same effect other parts of section  prominently encompass “present or former” directors officers employees or agents  in each case the point of using these terms is not to protect persons for actions that they take after they have ceased to serve ie for things they do after becoming “formers”  the point is rather to recognize the existence of continuing protection for those persons to the extent they took action while they were serving in covered capacities ie before they became “formers”c section fthe third informative subsection is section f which addresses whether a corporation can alter or eliminate the indemnification or advancement coverage that the corporation provided to an individual while serving in a covered capacity after that individual has served in reliance upon it  this scenario involves a more extreme variant of the continuation issue  instead of addressing whether a covered persons rights presumptively continue section f answers the more serious question of whether a corporation can cause those rights not to continue by altering or eliminating themin its present incarnation the relevant part of section f statesa right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil criminal administrative or investigative action suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurredid § f the “no termination clause”  the general assembly added this language to section f in  prompted by a decision which held that a covered persons advancement rights did not vest through service and did not presumptively continue to provide coverage for actions taken during the period of service after the director became a “former” thereby enabling a corporation to eliminate a directors coverage for past service  see schoon v troy corp  ad   del ch superseded by statute  del laws ch  §  the schoon case involved a claim for advancements by william j bohnen who had served as a director of troy corporation until he resigned in february   during his time as a director the relevant provision of troys bylaws stated  “the corporation shall pay the expenses incurred by any present or former director”  id at   another section of troys bylaws tracked the continuation clause and provided as followsthe rights conferred by this article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of such person and the heirs executors administrators and other comparable legal representatives of such personid at after bohnen resigned the troy board of directors amended the bylaws to remove the word “former”  the board accomplished this by striking the phrase “the corporation shall pay the expenses incurred by any present or former director” and replacing it with the following language  “losses reasonably incurred by a director or officer in defending any threatened or pending proceeding ․ shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition”  id at   the troy board of directors did not amend the continuation provisiontroy subsequently filed a plenary action against bohnen in which troy alleged that bohnen had breached his fiduciary duties while serving as a director  bohnen demanded that troy advance his legal fees  troy refused arguing that bohnen was now a former director and that its bylaws no longer provided advancements to former directorsin the ensuing litigation over bohnens advancement rights the trial court held that bohnen did not have a right to advancements  the decision interpreted the amended bylaw as limiting advancements to directors and officers who were serving in office at the time suit was filed  because the amendment eliminated a right bohnen previously had enjoyed the court considered whether bohnens rights had vested at the time of the amendment  the court held that a directors advancement rights did not vest until suit was filed and thus a board could change a directors rights at any time before that point  the court read the continuation provision of the bylaws and the continuation clause in section  as only contemplating continuation of advancement and indemnification rights after a lawsuit was filed  under this reading bohnens right to advancement right had not yet vested at the time of the amendment so the board could eliminate it without bohnens consentthe schoon case settled before the delaware supreme court could hear the appeal but the trial court decision was “promptly overturned by the delaware general assembly”  andrew m johnston amy l simmerman  jeffrey m gorris recent delaware law developments in advancement and indemnification  an analytical guide  nyu jl  bus     the synopsis to the amendment stated that the no termination clause “adopted a default rule different than the approach articulated in schoon ”  del hb  th gen assem syn §  in that vein the no termination clause started from a different premise than the schoon decision  the decision posited that a covered persons rights did not vest until the filing of litigation and hence could be altered or eliminated at any point before then  the no termination clause chose a different point in time for vesting by providing that indemnification and advancement rights “shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil criminal administrative or investigative action suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought”  the statutory language recognizes that a covered person serves in a covered capacity in reliance on the indemnification and advancement rights that the corporation has provided establishing a contractual relationship  as a matter of black letter contract law the covered persons service provides the consideration necessary to form a binding contract  see restatement second of contracts §    because the individuals rights vest at that point they cannot be amended retroactively unless the original grant of protection specifically contemplated the possibility of afterthefact amendmentthe no termination clause also started from a different premise than the schoon decision on another key issue  the schoon decision analyzed advancement and indemnification rights based on the individuals capacity at the time of suit which enabled the court to conclude that the rights had been terminated  by specifying that the rights are fixed at “the act or omission that is the subject of the civil criminal administrative or investigative action” the no termination clause confirms that coverage turns on the individuals capacity at the time of service consistent with other subsections in section   see part iib suprato illustrate the changes worked by section j an analogy to insurance law may be helpful  under the rejected schoonapproach indemnification and advancement rights would have operated in a manner analogous to claimsmade coverage  under the postamendment approach indemnification and advancement rights operate like occurrencebased insurance coverage  under the occurrencebased system protection for the covered period persists even though time has marched on and the individual has ceased to serve by the time the lawsuit is eventually filed  consequently “a director who has retired or resigned normally has continuing protection”   r franklin balotti  jesse a finkelstein the delaware law of corporations and business organizations § f at – suppd delaware public policysection e the continuation clause and the no termination clause thus establish a framework in which i a corporation can grant mandatory advancement rights to directors and officers that provide coverage conditioned solely on an undertaking section e ii those rights presumptively continue to provide coverage for actions the individuals took during their period of service even after the individuals have ceased to serve section j and iii those rights presumptively cannot be altered or eliminated after they have exposed themselves to potential suit by serving on the corporations behalf section f  this structure implements the public policy foundation for advancement and indemnification rights which is to “encourage capable men and women to serve as corporate directors secure in the knowledge that expenses incurred by them in upholding their honesty and integrity as directors will be borne by the corporation they serve”  the public policy foundation for advancement and indemnification rights has particular salience when lawsuits target former directors and officers for actions taken during their periods of service  as chief justice strine explained while serving as a vice chancellorcorporate advancement practice has an admittedly maddening aspect  at the time that an advancement dispute ripens it is often the case that the corporate board has drawn harsh conclusions about the integrity and fidelity of the corporate official seeking advancement  the board may well have a firm basis to believe that the official intentionally injured the corporation  it therefore is reluctant to advance funds for his defense fearing that the funds will never be paid back and resisting the idea of seeing further depletion of corporate resources at the instance of someone perceived to be a faithless fiduciarybut to give effect to this natural human reaction as public policy would be unwise  imagine what eds believes to be unthinkable  that the united states government and eds are in fact wrong about reddy  what if he in fact did not falsify records  what if he in fact did not do anything that was even grossly negligent  in that circumstance it would be difficult to conceive of an argument that would properly leave him holding the bag for all of his legal fees and expenses resulting from two cases centering on his conduct as an employee of eds that result would make the promise made to reddy in the eds bylaws an illusory onereddy v elec data sys corp wl  at – del ch june   footnote omittedas human beings the directors serving when a lawsuit is filed have a natural inclination to deny advancement to former directors and officers if they perceive those individuals as having harmed the corporation  mandatory indemnification and advancement rights address this concern but if those rights presumptively ceased when an individual stopped serving as a director or officer contra the continuation clause then former directors and officers again would face significant risk  if a corporation could alter or terminate a director or officers indemnification or advancement rights after service but before litigation was filed contra the no termination clause then the exposure would be greater  by establishing a statutory presumption of continuing coverage for actions taken during the period of service the continuation clause and the no termination clause ensure that the public policy interest prevails unless the individuals know when they choose to serve that their rights will terminate or can be cut off latere the upshot for marinounder the statutory framework as i understand it the companys charter conferred indemnification and advancement rights on marino that work as follows  when marino agreed to serve in a covered capacity he became entitled to receive mandatory indemnification and advancements to the fullest extent of delaware law  that coverage was part of the consideration that the company offered in exchange for his service  through service his coverage vested  the companys charter provision did not state up front that it could be amended retroactively or that marino would lose coverage when he ceased to serve  the company therefore could not amend the coverage retroactively section f and the coverage continues to protect marino even though he has ceased to serve section jmarinos continuing coverage is retrospective not prospective  the coverage only covers marino for his period of service as an officer and director and protects him against lawsuits brought “by reason of” his service  marino is not covered for actions taken after he stopped serving once he became a former officer and director  charney v am apparel  wl  at – del ch sept  although the coverage that the company provided to marino vested as a result of his service the coverage did not ripen into an enforceable right until triggered by a covered claim  the point at which a covered claim triggers an enforceable right is different for advancement and indemnificationmarinos mandatory advancement right ripened upon the existence of the covered claim  for these purposes a covered claim is not limited to actual litigation  it extends to “any civil criminal administrative or investigative action suit or proceeding” for which the covered person might receive indemnification   del c § e  importantly because the advancement right extends “to the fullest extent permitted by law” it encompasses not only any proceeding for which marino might later be indemnified under section a or b but also any proceeding for which he might later be indemnified under section c more than the existence of a covered claim is necessary to cause marinos mandatory indemnification right to ripen  an indemnification right ripens upon i the final disposition of the covered claim or ii in the case of statutory indemnification under section c success on the merits or otherwise  see sun–times media gp inc v black  ad   del ch strine vc  “it is generally premature to consider indemnification prior to the final disposition of the underlying action”  paolino v mace sec intl inc  ad   del ch application to the post–judgment motiondetermining whether and to what degree marino is entitled to advancements requires applying the preceding framework to the underlying action  marino only seeks advancements for defending against the post–judgment motion  he has not sought advancements for any expenses incurred defending against earlier phases of the underlying action  the scope of an individuals advancement rights normally turns on the pleadings in the underlying litigation that trigger the advancement right  in this case the scope of marinos right to advancement turns on the assertions in the post–judgment motionthe analysis of the post–judgment motion in turn requires distinguishing between i portions of the post–judgment motion in which marino is being pursued by reason of his service as a director and officer of the company and actions he took in those capacities and ii portions of the post–judgment motion relating to marinos actions after he resigned  marino is entitled to advancement for the former  he is not entitled to advancement for the latter  see charney  wl  at –recall that the post–judgment motion relies on section  of the california code which stateswhen jurisdiction is by the constitution or this code or by any other statute conferred on a court or judicial officer all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given  and in the exercise of this jurisdiction if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by this code or the statute any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the spirit of this codecalcivproccode §   to add

post–judgment motion focuses in large part on action that marino took in a covered capacity while serving as a director and officer of the company but it also involves some conduct that took place after marino resigned from his positions with the company  in the post–judgment motion sierra states that “marino personally participated in the conduct underlying the judgment”  dkt  ex at   sierra supports this assertion with the followingthe court already held marino was personally involved in the conduct underlying the judgment  in its order denying the companys rule b and  motions the court held that marinos personal conduct was “sufficient to show repeated trickery and deceit” on the part of parent and the company  the court concluded that marino ․ told sierra that the company would take no action at mcclellan without sierra and that the companys illicit bid was merely a “second bite at the apple” for sierra  the court also concluded that marino himself “convinced sierra to lower its capital investment offer” to mcclellan after which the company submitted a bid doubling sierras offer  sierra relied on marinos misrepresentations to its detriment and incurred severe damagesidat  citations and formatting omitted  these assertions depend on marino exercising corporate authority as an officer of the company and involve covered conduct  cf charney  wl  at –sierra also contends in the post–judgment motion that marino received confidential information from sierra in his capacity as the companys ceo then caused the company to use sierras confidential information to bid in response to and win mcclellans request for proposal  this is covered conduct  see liveops  ad at  finding causal connection requirement satisfied where former officer allegedly misappropriated the corporations trade secrets while a directorthe post–judgment motion similarly implicates covered conduct by arguing that parent and great–grandparent were alter egos of the company before the stock sale during marinos time as the companys chairman and ceo see dkt  ex at  in support of that argument sierra claims that• “marino dominated and controlled” the company before the stock sale• the “presale” company was an “arm  and instrumentality of marino”• marino “managed” the company as the “operational arm” of his family of entities “in pursuit of common business purpose”• marino was in charge of the companys daily operations• marino had final approval on everything that took place within the companyidat –  without expressing a view on whether allegations of this type would be sufficient to establish alter ego liability which is an issue for the california court these contentions necessarily invoke marinos corporate authority as the senior officer of the companya separate aspect of the post–judgment motion however rests only partially on marinos conduct in a covered capacity  sierra argues that section  permits a party to be added as a judgment debtor when the party participated in the litigation that gave rise to the judgment  see id at  before the stock sale marino supervised and controlled the litigation in his capacity as the senior officer at the company  he remained in that role for the first four years of the proceedings  after the stock sale however marino resigned from his positions with the company  at that point he may have participated in the litigation through his control of grandparent but his involvement was not “by reason of” his service to the company  he is entitled to advancement for his preresignation control over the litigation but not for his postresignation involvementa final aspect of the post–judgment motion does not involve covered conduct  the pre–judgment motion asserts that marino engaged in the fund transfers to defraud sierra  sierra further alleges that marino caused the company and grandparent to represent to the california court that “there would be no shifting or moving of assets to avoid judgment” then contradicted that representation by effecting the fund transfers  id at   these representations were made in june  after the stock sale closed and marino resigned from all positions with the company  likewise the fund transfers occurred after the stock sale closed  the company never received any funds  parent sold the companys stock to buyer and parent received the money  marino did not exercise company authority in connection with any of these actions and he is not entitled to advancements for defending this aspect of the post–judgment motion implementation going forwardmarino is thus

months and the availability of directors and officers insurance has been curtailed as insurers have dropped out of the field and policies have been cancelled  the van gorkom decision will aggravate that trend”  delaware responded with a package of legislation that offered “the best practical solution within the existing jurisprudential and legislative framework to what has been characterized as the ‘d  o crisis and its attendant problem of director resignation”  veasey et al supra at    see folk supra at – discussing nonexclusivity clause  veasey et al supra at – same  see also waltuch v conticommodity servs inc  fd  – d cir ruling on scope of nonexclusivity clause  joseph w bishop jr sitting ducks and decoy ducks  new trends in the indemnification of corporate directors and officers  yale lj    reviewing legislative history of nonexclusivity clause  david m mace directors and officers liability insurance  banking lj  –  analyzing delawares nonexclusivity clause and comparing it to similar provisions from other states   see id § c “to the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action suit or proceeding referred to in subsections a and b of this section or in defense of any claim issue or matter therein such person shall be indemnified against expenses including attorneys fees actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith” emphasis added  id § d “any indemnification under subsections a and b of this section unless ordered by a court shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director officer employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections a and b of this section” emphasis added  id § h “for purposes of this section references to ‘the corporation’ shall include in addition to the resulting corporation any constituent corporation ․ so that any person who is or was a director officer employee or agent of such constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director officer employee or agent of another entity shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued” emphasis added   see  amjurd insurance §  “the basic distinction between ‘claims made’ and ‘occurrence policies is that while the occurrence policy is triggered by the insureds liabilityproducing conduct the claims made policy is triggered by the presentation of a claim”  compare  cjs insurance §  “an occurrence type of liability policy protects the policyholder from damages resulting from acts occurring during the period in which the policy is in effect  the nature of an occurrence policy is to provide coverage for all occurrences that take place during the policy period regardless of when the claim is presented” footnotes omitted with id  §  “a ‘discovery’ or ‘claims made’ policy is one in which indemnity is provided no matter when the alleged error or omission or act of negligence occurred provided the misdeed complained of is discovered and the claim for indemnity is made against the insurance company during the policy period”   stifel fin corp v cochran  ad   del quotation marks omitted  accord homestore inc v tafeen  ad   del “advancement is an especially important corollary to indemnification as an inducement for attracting capable individuals into corporate service”  vonfeldt v stifel fin corp  ad   del explaining that advancement rights “encourage capable women and men to serve as corporate directors and officers secure in the knowledge that the corporation will absorb the costs of defending their honesty and integrity”  folk supra at  “the invariant policy of delaware legislation on indemnification is to promote the desirable end that corporate officials will resist what they consider unjustified suits and claims secure in the knowledge that their reasonable expenses will be borne by the corporation that they have served if they are vindicated” quotation marks omitted   see jennings v san vicente gp inc ca no  at  del ch mar   transcript “the right to seek advancement ․ came into existence ․ when the plaintiffs became directors․  at that point the right was inchoate but by its very nature became exercisable when an indemnifiable event occurred”  salaman v natl media corp  wl  at  delsuperoct   explaining that a directors rights to advancement and indemnification under the bylaws “vested” through the directors service at the time of the events giving rise to the underlying lawsuit and that the underlying lawsuit “triggered” the corporations obligations under the bylawscommentators who have discussed the operation of indemnification and advancement rights after the general assemblys response to schoon have described the point of vesting as combining both service and an event that later leads to litigation  see  david a drexler et al delaware corporation law and practice §  at – supp “under the current default rule the right to advancement vests at the time of the act or omission giving rise to such right”  mark a sargent  dennis r honabach d  o liability handbook § de  “the amendment to section f  effectively provides that a director or officers sic right to indemnification or advancement under a corporate bylaw vests at the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the ․ action suit or proceeding unless the bylaw expressly provides otherwise․  most commentators believe the court erred in schoon and predict that should another bylaw amendment case arise the courts would effectively apply the new provision retroactively”   welch et al folk on the delaware general corporation law §  at –– n th ed   “the  amendment effectively overruled the default position of some earlier cases holding that a directors right to advancement does not vest when the director takes office and that rights could be eliminated where there was no evidence that the corporation was contemplating claims against the director at the time of the amendment”because indemnification and advancement rights are triggered by actions suits and proceedings there necessarily will be an event that gives rise later to litigation  whether a particular act or omission will give rise to litigation often cannot not be known at the time of the act  it seems more straightforward to me therefore to speak of vesting through service  the statutory reference to the act or omission is nevertheless helpful in emphasizing that the scope of the operative right is determined at that point  it also makes clear that rights can be changed for prospective periods of service but not for past periods of service unless the right that previously governed that past period of service “otherwise provided when authorized or ratified”   see jennings ca no  at  “the right that had vested in these plaintiffs was a contract right that as in the salaman case cannot be taken away once it became vested”  salaman  wl  at  explaining that a directors “right to advancement and indemnification is a vested contract right which cannot be unilaterally terminated”  see also in re genelux corp  wl  at  del ch oct   “it would be inequitable to deny a former director his claimed right to advancement․  to hold otherwise would allow the company to allege misconduct of a director in his capacity as a fiduciary and to attempt to invalidate his personal property rights and related corporate rights without naming him a defendant thereby forcing him either to intervene in the action at his own expense or risk losing important rights”  kidsco inc v dinsmore  ad   n del ch stating that “no ‘contractual’ right to maintain an existing bylaw has ever been recognized except in the compelling and quite different context of a directors individual indemnification rights that became perfected before the board amended its bylaws” affd  ad  del  see also bergonzi v rite aid corp  wl  at  del ch oct   holding that corporation could not “unilaterally rescind” its charter provision that barred the corporation from asserting a “conduct” defense in advancement action and explaining that the corporation “must now maintain its bargain with its former officer”   see homestore inc v tafeen  ad  – del granting advancements to former officer where officer was named as a defendant in lawsuits “by reason of” actions he allegedly took during his period of service  stockman v heartland indus  prs lp  wl  at – del ch july   strine vc granting advancement to two former officers and directors of a limited partnership for civil and criminal proceedings brought against them in connection with their roles at the company  paolino v mace sec intl inc  ad   del ch granting advancement to former chairman and ceo of corporation to assert counterclaims in lawsuits “by reason of the fact” of his service  bernstein v tractmanager inc  ad   del ch granting advancements to former officer where officer was named as a defendant in lawsuits “by reason of” actions he allegedly took during his period of service  brown v liveops inc  ad   del ch granting advancements to former officer and director “by reason of the fact” of his previous service  weinstock v lazard debt recovery gp llc  wl  del ch aug   strine vc holding that a corporations advancement provision “does not grant advancement rights solely to indemnified parties who are currently serving in an official capacity but instead to all indemnified parties facing proceedings as defined in” the relevant provision  reddy v elec data sys corp  wl  at – del ch june   strine vc granting advancement to former employee to defend lawsuit brought “by reason of” his service as an employee  cf  gentile v singlepoint fin inc  ad   del per curiam denying advancement where bylaw expressly limited mandatory right of advancement to “named defendants”   see  del c § e  brady v i techs  inc  wl  at –  del ch dec   granting advancement to former executive and director for expenses relating to an internal investigation  tafeen v homestore inc  wl  at – del ch mar   granting advancement to former officer relating to an internal investigation affd  ad  del   see dunlap v sunbeam corp  wl  at  del ch july   holding that advancements were required under mandatory provision so long as mandatory indemnification under section c remained a possibility  see also zaman v amedeo hldgs inc  wl  at  del ch may   strine vc interpreting a bylaw provision that granted indemnification to an agent “to the full extent permitted by delaware law” as encompassing mandatory indemnification as permitted by section c  cochran v stifel fin corp  wl  at  del ch dec   strine vc interpreting bylaw provision that mandated indemnification of a party serving as a director officer and employee of a subsidiary “to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law” as encompassing mandatory indemnification as permitted by section c affd in pertinent part  ad  del   holley v nipro diagnostics inc  wl  at  del ch dec   “in this case the ‘by reason of the fact’ analysis requires looking to the allegations in the secs complaint  in that regard i note that courts can often determine whether the ‘by the reason of the fact’ requirement that has been satisfied solely by examining the pleadings in the underlying litigation ․“ footnote omitted  pontone v milso indus  corp  ad   del ch  “having reexamined the amended complaint in the
