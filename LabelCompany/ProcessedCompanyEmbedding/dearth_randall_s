and many morein the following excerpt from the water services report the president and ceo of calgon carbon corporation ccc discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industrytwst where is your focus in terms of the waterpurification processmr dearth historically municipalities in the us have used activated carbon to remove organic compounds that cause drinking water to have an offensive taste and odor in recent years municipalities have been installing activated carbon to meet the requirements of epa regulationsone of those regulations requires preventing or removing disinfection byproducts that are formed when chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the watertreatment process chlorine can react with organic matter in the water and form byproducts that can be hazardous to human health activated carbon can remove the disinfection byproducts or prevent them from forminga good example is the city of phoenix which several years ago decided to use activated carbon to combat this problem the city chose calgon carbon as its sole provider of the virgin carbon fill and then awarded us a year contract to reactivate that carbon at a new reactivation facility that we built in the phoenix areaas for future applications endocrine disrupters  which are essentially pharmaceuticals that make their way into drinking water when they are discarded  are becoming more of a concern activated carbon can be used to remove them although they are currently not regulated they could very well be in the futuretwst are you seeing a trend toward more awareness of the need for purification of water mr dearth yes for two reasons number one advancements in science enable us to better identify what is in the water number two environmental groups are now using the internet as a tool to educate people about impurities in their water as a result some consumers are pressing their municipalities to improve the quality of their water we are seeing this more and more
