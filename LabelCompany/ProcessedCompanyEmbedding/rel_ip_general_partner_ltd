articles search term location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies forming an llc partnerships vs llcs learn about the difference between partnerships and llcs by diana fitzpatrick jd share on google plus share on facebook many new businesses with more than one owner may consider whether to operate as partnerships or limited liability companies llcs there are two types of partnerships general partnerships and limited partnerships general partnerships involve two or more parties who voluntarily agree to own and run a forprofit business in which they equally share management duties and profits or losses limited partnerships are made up of at least one general partner who finances and manages a forprofit business as well as one or more limited partners who provide only capital to that partnership entity most states also recognize llcs with two or more owners called members multimember llcs are unincorporated business organizations which combine positive features of both partnerships and corporations for its members many state laws have adopted all or part of uniform laws that help govern general partnerships limited partnerships and llcs this overall review of general and limited partnerships and llcs focuses on four key aspects formation management profitsharing and legal liability formation a general partnership can be formed in a variety of formal and informal ways including orally in writing or implied by a court from party conduct such as pooling capital resources and sharing management duties and business profits or losses although not required to do so it is always recommended that you form a general partnership in a written partnership agreement or articles of partnership this type of agreement spells out each partner’s rights and duties and helps avoid future litigation between partners several states mandate the filing of a certificate of partnership to evidence the existence of a general partnership under most state laws limited partnerships are established in a more formal way through a required filing of a certificate of partnership with the relevant department normally the secretary of state’s office similar to general partnerships the general and limited partners may wish to enter into articles of limited partnership to clarify partner roles and obligations in operating that business although less complex to form than a standard corporation llcs require more formal documentation than general partnerships demand for multimember llcs the owners must enter into an operating agreement to clarify members’ different rights and responsibilities llcs must register articles of organization with a relevant state office these articles of organization usually identify an llc’s name the location of its principal offices the identities of its owners any planned llc term or duration along with other statutory requirements management a key characteristic of a general partnership is the equal right of each partner to manage the business enterprise typically each general partner possesses one vote in any key partnership decisions regardless of the amount of their individual capital contribution simple majorities normally determine the outcome of key business determinations under this business organization general partners must be able to persuade their coowners to agree with certain business policies or ideas limited partnerships may have either one general partner or two or more general partners who operate a limited partnership on a daily basis in a limited partnership with two or more general partners the management framework amongst them is often similar to general partnerships limited partners do not manage the business and supply only capital contributions if you are a single member llc you own manage and operate your business as a singleowner llc you can set your own business strategies and policies without having to consult or seek approval from others but you may lose out on the professional experiences and insights of fellow owners if there are two or more members your llc’s operating agreement may be used to structure management roles and decisionmaking authority in a way that best suits your business needs you may decide that all members will manage their llc or delegate management and decisionmaking powers to certain designated members profitsharing the division of profits and losses are similar for both general partnerships and multimember llcs unless the partners agree otherwise general partners and llc members share equally in the profits of their respective business organizations under a limited partnership general and limited partners usually share profits and losses based upon the value or percentage of each partner’s capital contributions to their business alternatively general and limited partners as well as llc owners possess the flexibility to enter into agreements to allocate business profits and losses in a different manner that best suits their respective business models legal liability like many aspects of the law legal liability often follows party control or authority in both general and limited partnerships general partners have unlimited personal liability since they manage their respective businesses when handling partnership business general partners are liable for their own conduct as well as the acts of their fellow general partners known as joint and several liability conversely limited partners only risk their capital contributions in limited partnerships similar to shareholders in a corporation or members in an llc however if a limited partner participates in managing the business or signs a personal guarantee for the business they may be held personally liable for these business obligations llc members are entitled to manage while retaining the limited personal liability of shareholders in a corporation normally llc members are not personally liable for llc debts or legal liabilities putting only their financial contributions to their llc at risk llc owners may still be personally liable for their own conduct that harms others for breaches of their duties owed to their llc or personally guarantees llc loans any business owner should consider appropriate insurance and other liability protection strategies to help shield personal assets and

topics business formation llcs  corporations partnerships partnership basics partnership basics learn more about the simplest business structure for companies with more than one owner by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or llc limited liability company there are two basic types of partnerships  general partnerships and limited partnerships the general partnership is the simplest and least expensive coowned business structure to create and maintain however there are a few important facts you should know about the personal liability of general partners by definition a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or llc limited liability company there are two basic types of partnerships general partnerships and limited partnerships this article discusses general partnerships the more common structure in which every partner has a hand in managing the business the partnership is the simplest and least expensive coowned business structure to create and maintain however there are a few important facts you should know before you begin personal liability for all owners first partners are personally liable for all business debts and obligations including court judgments this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor such as a supplier lender or landlord the creditor can legally come after any partners house car or other possessions there are a few exceptions to this personal liability some of the partners can have limited personal liability if the partnership is set up as a limited partnership this is a partnership in which only the general partner who runs the business has personal liability while the limited partners who are basically passive investors can lose no more than their stake in the partnership also some states allow special limited liability partnerships llps more commonly though businesspeople who are particularly concerned about personal liability choose to incorporate their business or operate as a limited liability company llc for more information see nolos articles on corporations  and  limited liability companies joint authority in addition any individual partner can usually bind the whole business to a contract or other business deal for instance if your partner signs a yearlong contract with a supplier to buy inventory at a price your business cant afford you can be held personally responsible for the money owed under the contract there are just a few limits on a partners ability to commit the partnership to a deal  for instance one partner cant bind the partnership to a sale of all of the partnerships assets but generally unless an outsider has reason to know of any limits the partners have placed on each others authority in their partnership agreement any partner can bind the others to a deal joint liability each individual partner can be sued for  and required to pay  the full amount of any business debt if this happens an individual partners only recourse may be to sue the other partners for their shares of the debt because of this combination of personal liability for all partnership debt and the authority of each partner to bind the partnership its critical that you trust the people with whom you start your business partnership taxes a partnership is not a separate tax entity from its owners instead its what the irs calls a passthrough entity this means the partnership itself does not pay any income taxes on profits business income simply passes through the business to the partners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual income tax returns in addition each partner must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs each year while the partnership itself doesnt pay taxes it must file irs form  an informational return each year this form sets out each partners share of the partnership profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure the partners are reporting their income correctly for more information on reporting and paying partnership taxes see how partnerships are taxed creating a partnership you dont have to file any paperwork to establish an ordinary partnership  just agreeing to go into business with another person will get you started of course partnerships must  meet the same local registration requirements as any new business most cities and counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax you may also have to obtain an employer identification number from the irs a sellers license from your state and a zoning permit from your local planning board in addition your partnership may have to register a fictitious or assumed business name if your business name doesnt contain all of the partners last names for instance you want to use london landscapes instead of harper  reed landscapes you usually must register that name  known as a fictitious or assumed business name  with your county clerk for more information on fictitious business names see registering your business name while the owners of a partnership are not legally required to have a written partnership agreement it makes good sense to put the details of ownership including the partners rights and responsibilities and their share of profits into a written agreement for more about why partnership agreements are so important read creating a partnership agreement ending a partnership one disadvantage of partnerships is that when one partner wants to leave the company the partnership generally dissolves in that case the partners must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts and divide any assets and profits among themselves if you want to prevent this kind of ending for your business you should create a buysell agreement or buyout agreement which can be included as part of your partnership agreement a buysellbuyout agreement helps partners decide and plan for what will happen when one partner retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the partnership to pursue other interests for example such an agreement might allow the partners to buy out a departing partners interest so business can continue as usual for more information see plan ahead for changes
