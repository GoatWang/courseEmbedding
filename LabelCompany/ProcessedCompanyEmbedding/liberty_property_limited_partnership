for  million in january  due to longterm trends that the company believes favor industrial properties and indicate potential erosion in value of suburban office properties the company has increased its investment in industrial and metrooffice properties and decreased its investment in suburban office properties the shortterm effect of these activities has been a decrease in net cash from operating activities as rental income related to the companys industrial properties is less than that from the companys suburban office properties assuming similar amounts invested the company anticipates that over time it will realize the benefits of these activities including a higher rate of rental growth and a lower level of transaction costs for industrial properties as opposed to suburban office properties for  in the aggregate the net cash provided by operating activities less customary capital expenditures and leasing transaction costs was less than dividend distributions
