gastrointestinal system contains a natural and widely varied microbial ecosystem called the gut microbiome  diet exercise disease and many other factors affect the gut microbiome that can alter the balance of good and bad bacteria  good gastrointestinal health is achieved by facilitating the growth of good bacteria while keeping bad bacterial growth in check   elemental iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate cause a shift in the gut microbiome causing bad bacteria to flourish and preventing good bacterial persistencebiofe has been engineered in order to protect the balance of the gut microbiome providing a natural biologic form of iron as a ferritiniron complex much like mothers milk for an infant the product biofe™ is the first medical food product from the siderosorb™ platform bakers yeast expressing the human hferritin gene fth the hferritin proteiniron complex is an indispensable mammalian iron absorption transport and storage system that is delivered directly to the bloodstream from the intestine in the nontoxic fe state an illustrative example of the natural biology of the ferritiniron complex is its presence in human breast milk providing nursing infants the readily adsorbed iron required for rapid learning and development biofe™ provides stable high level expression of the ferritin protein that is complexed with iron during growth  biofe™ is pasturized and dried allowing its incorporation into a variety of formats for consumption  alone biofe™ is pleasant tasting with a sweet nutty flavor we have demonstrated that biofe™ is effective in two animal models of iron deficiency anemia ida first in a rat model of ida biofe™ was found to be significantly more effective than the current standardofcare ferrous sulfate feso at correcting serum iron and hemoglobin levels second spontaneously anemic infant monkeys achieved normal serum iron and hemoglobin levels with just two weeks of biofe™ treatment  spontaneously iron deficient monkeys is a very good model of human iron deficiency these primate experiments will continue with an ongoing m grant from the national institutes of health nihsidero is currently launching two clinical trials of
