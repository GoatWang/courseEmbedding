data for tipifarnib in the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral tcell lymphoma ptcl was presented at the international conference on malignant lymphoma icml being held june   in lugano switzerland kura oncology is conducting preclinical and clinical development studies in clinical indications where tipifarnib has previously shown signs of activity with the goal to identify and validate biomarkers associated with the observed clinical activity of tipifarnib the preliminary phase  clinical data presented at icml indicate that tipifarnib has antitumor activity in ptcl particularly in patients with angioimmunoblastic tcell lymphoma aitl histology and ptclnos not otherwise specified histology with high levels of cxcl gene expression and absence of single nucleotide gene variations in the untranslated region of the cxcl gene patients with ptcl have a poor overall survival of about  effective options for relapsed patients are limited and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed these results identify the cxclcxcr pathway as a potential target of tipifarnib cxcl is secreted in large amounts by lymph nodes bone marrow stroma liver and lung and plays key roles in tumor invasion bone marrow homing and site of metastasis its receptor cxcr signals in part through hras a protein that is uniquely farnesylated and it is one of the most frequently

stabilization in addition tipifarnib was generally welltolerated with adverse events consistent with its known safety profile and no patient discontinued due to adverse events the phase  study has
