view cash as our “default investment” and generally do not employ leverage while the team has always focused on the business characteristics valuation competitive advantages and management abilities of individual companies and securities we also pursue limited macro investing strategies to hedge macroeconomic risk philosophy the team believes shortterm volatility is not a “loss” permanent intrinsic value impairment is we are grounded in principles of absolute not relative value and believe longterm free cash flow generation is the ultimate source of business worth investment objective the team generally owns interests in a very limited number of companies and securities that we hope will compound in value over many years we seek to maximize longterm appreciation with an intense focus on risk management and margin of safety unique attributes  of  longterm outlook our longerterm orientation allows us to hold investments through periods of volatility and to enjoy the potential

this is an action to recover significant investment losses suffered as a result of the unprecedented meltdown of a  billion drug company valeant is a pharmaceutical company based in bridgewater new jersey that develops manufactures and markets prescription drugs overthecounter products and medical devices unbeknownst to plaintiffs and the rest of the market between  and  defendants valeant pearson and schiller made material misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts in order to a conceal the existence of a network of specialty pharmacies whose sole purpose was to steer patients toward valeant products even when much cheaper generic alternatives were available and b mislead investors that valeant’s growth derived from organic volume increases when in fact such growth was driven primarily by valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring medications and drastically increasing their prices as the truth was gradually revealed to the market the price of valeant securities plummeted from over  per share in mid to under  per share by the time the fraud was fully revealed in mid  until october   defendants improperly concealed the existence of and valeant’s relationship with philidor a specialty pharmacy whose only client was valeant and which generated significant revenues for valeant by using a network of purportedly independent pharmacies to dispense valeant drugs over cheaper generic equivalents  despite having a long and deep relationship with philidor valeant went to great lengths to conceal its ties to philidor valeant employees were heavily involved in the formation of philidor in january  but used aliases to conceal their involvement valeant was philidor’s only pharmaceutical company client but philidor used a network of differentlynamed pharmacies in several states to keep other industry participants from learning about philidor’s connection to valeant philidor also required its employees to enter into confidentiality case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   agreements valeant exercised various forms of control over philidor’s operations and senior personnel in december  valeant obtained an option to acquire  of philidor for  after which valeant began consolidating philidor’s financial results with its own but did not identify philidor to investors as a consolidated entity  although philidor effectively operated as a division of valeant defendants hid philidor’s existence and valeant’s ties to philidor their reason for doing so was the serious regulatory and reimbursement risks that would materialize if other participants in the industry knew of valeant’s relationship with philidor had they known about the connection between valeant and philidor large pharmacy benefit managers would have scrutinized and denied reimbursement requests from philidor because of the likelihood that the specialty pharmacy was just a shill for one of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers this was subsequently confirmed when the three largest pharmacy benefit managers dropped philidor from their programs after philidor’s relationship with valeant was revealed in late  despite trumpeting its “alternate fulfillment” distribution channel to investors valeant concealed that it consisted of a captive pharmacy that thirdparty payors would reject  under generally accepted accounting principles valeant was required to provide certain information about philidor including among other things philidor’s nature size purpose activities and how it was financed in its financial statements valeant’s management also was required to disclose philidor as a separate sales channel in its quarterly discussion of valeant’s operating results defendants’ failure to do so rendered valeant’s public filings with the sec materially false misleading and incomplete  in addition to concealing philidor defendants misled investors about the drivers of valeant’s rapid growth between  and  valeant experienced significant revenue case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   growth as valeant’s rapid rise came under increasing scrutiny valeant repeatedly stressed to investors that it was mostly the result of organic volume growth and not because of valeant raising prices on newly acquired drugs as late as october   valeant publicly represented that “volume growth contributes significantly more than price” to its business  this mattered to investors because volumebased growth implies more sustainable longterm cash flows than shortterm price increases  however valeant’s representations about its “organic growth” were materially false and misleading as would later be revealed valeant’s steep growth was fueled by acquiring existing medications from other drug companies and then drastically increasing the prices on those drugs defendants were well aware of the real drivers behind valeant’s growth indeed after one occasion where pearson told investors that growth was based on volume and not price he received an email from defendant schiller valeant’s cfo reminding him that price increases actually accounted for  of valeant’s growth  the effect of defendants’ misrepresentations about the existence of philidor and valeant’s growth was to artificially inflate the price of valeant’s securities  plaintiffs are investment funds that purchased valeant common stock between february   and october   during the time when defendants unbeknownst to plaintiffs were concealing valeant’s connection to philidor and making misleading statements about valeant’s growth as the truth was gradually disclosed and processed by the market thereby causing valeant’s stock price to decline plaintiffs suffered significant losses  unless otherwise noted

june  schiller had a long career in investment banking prior to joining valeant case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   fraudbased claims i factual allegations a overview of the pharmaceutical industry  the global pharmaceutical industry is one of the largest markets in the world the value of the us pharmaceutical market alone is estimated to reach well over half a trillion dollars by   the traditional business model for how pharmaceutical companies generate revenue is relatively straightforward drug companies develop new medications that once approved by the food and drug administration “fda” are patented and marketed to the medical profession and consumers medical professionals prescribe those drugs to patients patients take the prescription to a pharmacy to be filled and the pharmacist dispenses the medication to the patient with the patient paying a copay and the patient’s insurer paying the remaining amount for the medication  in the modern pharmaceutical industry pharmacy benefit managers or “pbms” play a significant role pbms are thirdparty administrators retained by prescription drug plans that according to the american pharmacists association “are primarily responsible for developing and maintaining the formulary contracting with pharmacies negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers and processing and paying prescription drug claims” pbms create pharmacy networks pursuant to which only approved pharmacies can dispense drugs under plans that the pbms administer the three largest pbms – expressscripts cvs caremark and optumrx – control approximately of  of the pbm market in the us  for many pharmaceutical manufacturers the time during which their brandname products face no generic competition is an extremely important period when a brandname drug is first approved by the fda there is a period of exclusivity that allows the drug case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   manufacturer to set the price so that it can first recoup its expenses and then generate a profit once generic equivalents of the brandname drug enter the market however the brandname drug loses its competitive advantage indeed it is not unusual for a pharmacist to automatically substitute an available generic equivalent for a brandname prescription because of the lower price of the generic drug  one of the faster growing areas in the pharmaceutical industry is the rise of “specialty pharmacies” to dispense specialty drugs specialty drugs are typically prescribed to treat chronic diseases such as cancer hiv and multiple sclerosis are highcost and can be difficult to administer traditional retail pharmacies are not wellequipped to provide the individual attention that patients require to determine the cheapest way to obtain specialty drugs and to administer the medication legitimate specialty pharmacies provide the necessary services to help patients obtain and administer specialty drugs b valeant’s business model  valeant was founded as a pharmaceutical company in california in  by milan panic a former olympic cyclist who later became prime minister of yugoslavia originally called icn pharmaceuticals the company changed its name to valeant in   in  one of valeant’s largest investors – valueact – brought defendant pearson on board as valeant’s ceo pearson did not have a medical background but rather had spent twentythree years at mckinsey a management consulting firm pearson’s business background shaped the direction in which he steered valeant  pearson pursued a business model for valeant that was different from other pharmaceutical manufacturers traditionally pharmaceutical companies invest significant capital in the research and development “rd” of new drugs however the pharmaceutical rd process can be inefficient costly and timeconsuming therefore pearson advocated for a case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   strategy of spending less on rd and instead acquiring other drug companies that had already developed products according to a recent vanity fair article pearson’s motto was “don’t bet on science – bet on management”  pearson followed a handson approach to his management of valeant according to an article in bloomberg businessweek that quoted valeant employees who worked for pearson “he had his fingers in everything from operations to making decisions about the salaries of individual employees”  valeant experienced tremendous growth the company made over  acquisitions between  and  in  and  valeant built a significant position in dermatology by acquiring companies such as medicis pharmaceutical corp “medicis” obagi medical products “obagi” dermik and ortho dermatologics in  valeant became a large player in the ophthalmology market when it acquired bausch  lomb  valeant also cut costs with pearson at its helm pearson slashed valeant’s investment in rd of new drugs then in  valeant reduced its tax rate to the lowest of any pharmaceutical company in the world by merging with a canadian company biovail which operated through offshore subsidiaries in tax friendly jurisdictions  between  and  valeant’s stock priced soared rising from around  per share to over  per share as explained below much of this stock price growth was caused by defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions c valeant’s reporting obligations as a public company  under the federal securities laws and the regulations and guidance promulgated by the sec pursuant to those laws companies whose stock is publicly traded in the us – such as valeant – have important reporting and disclosure obligations these requirements were case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   created by the government to restore investor confidence in the integrity of the us capital markets in the wake of the great depression  public companies are required to file with the sec certain disclosure documents containing comprehensive information about their business operations and their financial condition investors rely on the accuracy and transparency of these disclosures when determining whether to invest  as a publicly traded corporation with significant operations in the us valeant is required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” in order for those financial statements not to be deemed misleading and inaccurate us gaap is a set of rules and standards that are designed to ensure uniform financial reporting  one of those standards is asb accounting standards codification topic  consolidation “asc ” among other things asc  sets forth rules governing the disclosure by public companies in their financial statements of “variable interest entities” or “vies” loosely defined a vie is an entity in which the reporting company has a controlling interest a vie of which the reporting company is the “primary beneficiary” must be consolidated in the reporting company’s financial statements asc  requires that certain information about both consolidated and unconsolidated vies be disclosed in an issuer’s financial statements  in addition to complying with us gaap public companies are required to follow the standards developed by the sec governing what information must be disclosed in financial statements and other public filings for example with respect to assessing materiality in preparing financial statements the sec has released staff accounting bulletin no  “sab case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   ” which emphasizes the importance of qualitative factors in determining materiality in sab  the sec stated that while it had no objection to using a numerical threshold of  as a starting point in assessing materiality “quantifying in percentage terms the magnitude of a misstatement is only the beginning of an analysis of materiality it cannot appropriately be used as a substitute for a full analysis of all relevant considerations” thus for example a quantitative misstatement of revenue under  might be deemed material if “the misstatement hides a failure to meet analysts’ consensus expectations”  certain sec filings – such as the issuer’s annual report – are required to contain a section titled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the “mda” the purpose of the mda is to give investors an opportunity to see the issuer’s past results and future prospects through the eyes of management see  cfr §  according to topic  of the sec staff accounting bulletin series “sab topic ” the a requires a discussion of liquidity capital resources results of operations and other information necessary to an understanding of a registrant’s financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations this includes unusual or infrequent transactions known trends or uncertainties that have had or might reasonably be expected to have a favorable or unfavorable material effect on revenue operating income or net income and the relationship between revenue and the costs of the revenue changes in revenue should not be evaluated solely in terms of volume and price changes but should also include an analysis of the reasons and factors contributing to the increase or decrease sab topic  further provides that the types of revenue transactions or events that should be disclosed in the mda include among other things “cng trends in shipments into and sales from a sales channel or separate class of customer that could be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sales returns” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    as explained in greater detail below throughout the relevant period valeant represented to investors that it was complying with these important public reporting obligations by timely disclosing truthful material facts about its business however unbeknownst to the market valeant was making misrepresentations about its illicit use of a secret network of pharmacies and its growth which – when the truth was slowly revealed to the outside world – caused a precipitous decline in the value of valeant securities d valeant’s web of deception  valeant’s clandestine specialty pharmacy network  in september  valeant announced that it was acquiring medicis for a price of  billion medicis was a dermatological and aesthetic pharmaceutical products company that manufactured among other things the acne treatment drugs solodyn and ziana  a new business model that medicis had been exploring prior to its acquisition by valeant was an “alternate fulfillment” or “af” initiative under that program rather than wait for insurance approval to dispense solodyn and ziana to a patient medicis would dispense the medication and assume the risk that the insurer would refuse to pay  when valeant acquired medicis it decided to expand the af intiative pearson told investors that the af initiative was complex had several “stages” or “phases” but that valeant was developing some “exciting opportunities” by expanding the alternate fulfillment initiative however defendants refused to provide specifics about what those developments were  unbeknownst to investors valeant’s expansion of the af initiative involved creating a captive specialty pharmacy whose only client was valeant but whose success was based on the outside world having no knowledge of valeant’s connection to that pharmacy this pharmacy was named “philidor” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    philidor was an illegitimate sales channel that valeant created to peddle numerous valeant products valeant’s ability to increase the sales of its drugs through philidor had the effect of materially boosting valeant’s revenues however in order to do so valeant had to conceal its ties to philidor had the thirdparty payors who reimbursed valeant known that philidor was effectively operating as a division of valeant they would not have paid for the valeant drugs philidor was dispensing  philidor was founded in january  purportedly as an independent specialty mailorder pharmacy designed to fill ship and obtain insurance approval for dermatological medicines philidor was licensed in  states and the district of columbia its network of pharmacies included locations in california florida new jersey south carolina and texas  valeant used its own employees to launch philidor valeant hired gary tanner to act as its liaison with philidor prior to philidor even being incorporated tanner traveled frequently between philidor’s offices and valeant’s offices according to a former philidor employee tanner oversaw all valeant employees who were sent to work at philidor  just one day after philidor was incorporated valeant hired laizer kornwasser to act as tanner’s supervisor kornwasser reported directly to defendant pearson  after having set up philidor valeant employees were then used to develop philidor’s business of selling valeant products  to conceal valeant’s connection to philidor valeant employees used fake names on their philidor email accounts a valeant manager who worked at philidor’s phoenix arizona office used the alias “peter parker” – the alter ego of spiderman another valeant employee masqueraded under the name “jack reacher” a fictional character played by tom cruise in a case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    movie of the same name yet another valeant employee – apparently a fan of the beach boys – used the name “brian wilson” to conceal his identity  at valeant’s direction philidor representatives steered patients toward valeant’s medications and away from less expensive alternatives and generics philidor provided patients who were prescribed valeant medications coupons to reduce the cost of the drug to the patient philidor would then ship the valeant drugs to the patient prior to obtaining insurance approval if the insurers questioned why doctors prescribed valeant drugs instead of more affordable alternatives philidor representatives intervened philidor was paid a per prescription service fee for its work in implementing valeant’s alternate fulfillment program  as philidor’s business of distributing only valeant medications grew valeant decided to purchase philidor to further cement its ties to philidor’s network of pharmacies operating throughout the us solely for the benefit of valeant  however valeant needed to do so in a way that would not reveal its ties to philidor to the outside world accordingly valeant agreed to pay significant amounts to acquire philidor but structured the transaction in a way so that it did not disclose it as an acquisition  specifically in december  valeant entered into a purchase option agreement with philidor agreeing to pay philidor  million for a tenyear option to purchase philidor for  valeant also agreed to make additional payments to philidor upon the attainment of various milestones  management and the board of directors of valeant toured philidor’s facilities prior to executing the purchase agreement in december  valeant’s management then made the decision to enter into the transaction and how to account for it case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    as a result of this transaction valeant created a joint steering committee to directly control philidor the joint steering committee was composed of members from valeant and philidor  valeant also obtained the right to control who philidor hired for certain positions including an advisor to the ceo the head compliance officer an inhouse lawyer and a head it officer and received the right to obtain certain information from philidor including the ability to access philidor’s books records and facilities  in the purchase option agreement philidor covenanted to valeant that it would comply with all applicable laws and agreed to indemnify valeant against thirdparty claims relating to philidor’s business practices  although philidor effectively operated as a division of valeant valeant took deliberate measures to conceal the relationship from pbms insurers and medical professionals  rather than operating throughout the united states under philidor’s name valeant and philidor created a network of pharmacies with different names these pharmacies were designed to obscure valeant’s close ties to philidor and to avoid scrutiny from the pbms by creating the appearance that many separate independent pharmacies were distributing valeant medications  philidor also required its employees to sign confidentiality agreements so that according to reuters philidor could “sue workers who divulged information about its activities”  as philidor’s covert network of pharmacies to exclusively distribute valeant products expanded philidor’s sales accounted for more and more of valeant’s revenues by the time that valeant began disclosing its relationship with philidor at the end of october  case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   philidor accounted for at least  of valeant’s yeartodate net revenue for the third quarter of  alone philidor accounted for at least  of valeant’s total revenues  valeant does not dispute that it considered philidor to be a vie for accounting purposes from  on however it improperly failed to disclose philidor in its annual reports for  and  in each of its quarterly reports in  and  and the first two quarterly reports of   valeant’s failure to disclose philidor rendered its affirmative statements about its alternate fulfillment program materially misleading and incomplete in  at various investor conferences pearson made references to improvements that it was making to its alternate fulfillment program however pearson failed to disclose that its approach to that program could subject valeant to serious regulatory and reimbursement risks because of the way valeant was covertly utilizing philidor to increase sales of valeant products  moreover under sab topic  as discussed in more detail below valeant had an obligation to disclose philidor as a distinct sales channel in the mda portion of its periodic reports between  and   the fact that valeant considered philidor to be a vie required defendants to disclose certain information about philidor in valeant’s financial statements pursuant to asc  including a philidor’s nature size purpose activities and how it was financed and b the methodology for concluding that valeant was not required to consolidate philidor’s financial statements with its own in its  k valeant misrepresented to the market that “there were no material arrangements determined to be variable interest entities”  once valeant consolidated philidor’s financial statements in  because it determined that philidor was a vie of which valeant was the primary beneficiary valeant was case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   additionally required under asc  to disclose the factors that resulted in the consolidation – ie the purchase option agreement with philidor however it failed to do so simply and falsely stating in its  k that “the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and those of its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities “vies” for which the company is the primary beneficiary” and “dber   the company completed other smaller acquisitions including the consolidation of variable interest entities which are not material individually or in the aggregate”  there can be no dispute that defendants knew about the existence of philidor and valeant’s relationship to philidor at the same time they hid their existence from investors and other pharmaceutical industry players indeed the company has conceded as much stating that it did not disclose philidor because it wanted to maintain a “competitive advantage” however the fact that a company wishes to maintain a competitive advantage does not relieve it from its obligations to comply with us gaap and the sec’s disclosure requirements and to avoid misleading its investors  in an october   investor presentation valeant told investors that although it considered philidor to be a vie it was not required to disclose philidor in its financial reports because it did not consider philidor to be a material part of its business specifically valeant argued that us gaap required sales to “customers” to be disclosed only if such sales accounted for more than  of valeant’s revenues  valeant’s claim that philidor was not material to its business is insupportable as an initial matter valeant stated in its october   presentation on philidor that the specialty pharmacy accounted for “ or less of consolidated net revenues since q ” given that valeant’s revenue losses following philidor’s closure in late  were far greater than  this case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   was an understatement thus philidor met the  quantitative materiality standard under sab   valeant’s argument that philidor was not quantitatively material because it did not meet valeant’s  threshold for customer sales is completely misplaced philidor was not a “customer” of valeant rather it effectively operated as a division of valeant valeant should have consolidated philidor prior to december  because valeant was the primary beneficiary of philidor see asc  in any event once valeant consolidated philidor in december  it could not possibly claim that philidor was a customer because philidor was an arm of valeant  moreover even if not quantitatively material both before and after consolidation philidor was still qualitatively material to valeant and its investors because of the risks that valeant’s relationship with philidor posed to the company see sab  the concealment of valeant’s relationship with philidor was essential to valeant being able to channel sales through philidor so long as the pbms had no idea about the connection between philidor and valeant they had no reason to suspect any collusion  that philidor’s ties to valeant were qualitatively material to valeant’s business is confirmed by the fact that the three major pbms dropped philidor from their networks – which was a deathknell for philidor – when they found out about valeant’s deceptive use of philidor to move valeant products  the myth of valeant’s purported “organic” growth  between january   and september   valeant experienced significant revenue growth  specifically in  valeant recorded  billion of revenue in  valeant recorded  billion of revenue in  valeant recorded  billion of revenue and in the first three quarters of  valeant recorded annualized revenues of  billion case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    valeant represented to investors that the main driver of this growth was organic volume increases in drug sales and not price hikes on the medications themselves  whether valeant’s steep growth was driven by volume instead of price increases was highly material to investors the problem with price increases is that they constitute the corporate equivalent of a sugar rush the price increase gives the company a large shortterm bump in revenue but that revenue bump soon runs its course because there is a market imposed limit to how often and by how much the price of a particular drug can be increased price increases generally cannot sustain robust longterm growth  to achieve sustained growth the company needed a program to increase demand for its current products thereby leading to higher sales volumes as well as a development or acquisition pipeline to introduce new products  thus for investors focused on longterm cash flows and growth it mattered whether valeant’s reported revenue increases were the product of shortterm price hikes or organic sales volume increases a company that obfuscates or lies about its real growthdrivers misleads investors about its current financial health and longterm prospects  in early  valeant made a hostile takeover bid for allergan inc “alllergan” in an attempt to ward off the takeover bid allergan told its shareholders that it had “serious concerns about the sustainability of valeant’s business model” specifically allergan accused valeant of among other things “low organic growth driven mostly by price increases”  in response to allergan’s accusations on may   valeant held an investor meeting and conference call during that call pearson denied allergan’s accusations and told case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   investors that valeant had “delivered strong organic growth” and that its ability to increase prices in certain sectors was actually restricted  that same day pearson participated in a conference in which he further expounded that valeant “focuses e growth and the vast majority of our growth on a global basis – and we went through some of that this morning – is volume”  on june   pearson and schiller hosted a conference call to further address allergan’s accusations during which pearson told investors that “volume is a much larger piece of our organic growth than most people would assume it is”  throughout  and into  valeant continued to tout its significant “organic growth” as a result of volume increases of particular note on april   pearson and schiller hosted a conference call in connection with the release of valeant’s first quarter financial results during the call one analyst asked pearson to quantify how price and volume contributed to valeant’s first quarter growth pearson responded in terms of price volume actually volume was greater than price in terms of our growth outside the united states it’s all volume     and in the united states it’s shifting more to volume than price and we expect that to continue a lot of our prices for most of our products are negotiated with managed care and there’s only a limited amount of price we can take    so it’s primarily volume  in september  as public scrutiny of valeant’s practices was increasing pearson wrote a letter to valeant’s employees in that letter – which was publicly filed by valeant with the sec – pearson boldly stated that “valeant is wellpositioned for strong organic growth even assuming little to no price increases” and that “valeant’s core operating principles include a focus on volume growth”  as pearson and schiller have since admitted however these statements about valeant’s purported strong organic growth driven by volume increases were patently false case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    valeant’s significant growth was not attributable to volume increases but rather was driven by significant price hikes on newly acquired products  many of the drugs acquired by valeant were designed to treat rare medical conditions such drugs faced little competition from generic equivalents because of the small populations they serviced moreover due to a backlog at the fda there was a significant period before any such generic equivalents would come to market accordingly after valeant acquired these drugs it was able to – and did – significantly increase their prices with little scrutiny from the other participants in the pharmaceutical industry  for example in early  marathon pharmaceuticals llc “marathon” was seeking to divest itself of about half a dozen medications as part as a change in business strategy two of the drugs for sale were the heart medications isuprel and nitropress at that time there were no generic equivalents for isuprel and nitropress  internal documents produced by valeant to congress show that in december  and january  valeant conducted research on its ability to purchase isuprel and nitropress and immediately raise their prices according to a presentation dated january   valeant believed that the drugs had pricing “flexibility by multiple orders of magnitude”  the day after acquiring isuprel and nitropress valeant significantly raised their prices specifically a vial of nitropress went from  to   increase and isuprel was bumped up from  to   increase  isuprel and nitropress were not the only drugs that valeant acquired and increased prices other drugs where valeant implemented steep price increases to drive its revenue growth included case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    targretin gel a topical treatment for lymphoma from  in  to  in   increase most of which occurred after valeant acquired the drug in   carac cream used to treat precancerous skin lesions from  in  to  in   increase most of which occurred after valeant acquired the drug in   syprine a chelating agent for treatment of wilson’s disease from  in  to  in   increase  cuprimime also a chelating agent for treatment of wilsons disease from  in  to  in   increase  glumetza a diabetes drug from  to   increase  despite their public statements to the contrary defendants were well aware of the connection between valeant’s price increases and its significant revenue growth for example on may   schiller sent pearson an email with the subject “price volume” in that email schiller stated “last night one of the investors asked about price vs volume for q excluding isuprel and nitropressprice represented about  of our growth if you include isuprel and nitropress price represents about ”  both pearson and schiller have since admitted that valeant’s steep growth was the result of price increases and not what was previously represented to the market  on february   schiller appeared before congress as valeant’s acting ceo schiller admitted to the congressional panel that  of valeant’s growth in the first quarter of  was the result of price increases and not expanded market share  on april   pearson appeared before congress in his prepared remarks pearson confessed that valeant had “made mistakes” in delivering a mea culpa to the members of the senate committee on aging pearson stated “tpany was too aggressive – and i as its leader was too aggressive – in pursuing price increases on certain drugs let me state case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   plainly that it was a mistake to pursue and in hindsight i regret pursuing transactions where a central premise was planned increase in the prices of the medicines    ”  during that hearing pearson was questioned by senator mccaskill about whether growth was driven by price rather than volume between the first quarter of  and the third quarter of  for all but one quarter in response pearson admitted that “yes pricing has driven more growth than volume” e the truth gradually emerges and the prices of valeant’s securities plummet  valeant’s business was a house of cards built on unsustainable price increases a secret network of pharmacies designed to exclusively peddle valeant’s products and a culture of deception set by pearson and schiller that resulted in the manipulation of the company’s financial information as the truth about philidor valeant’s improper revenue recognition and valeant’s artificial growth slowly leaked into the market through a series of partial disclosures the price of valeant securities dropped precipitously  on october   the new york times published an article with the headline “valeant’s drug price strategy enriches it but infuriates patients and lawyers” while price increases for the drugs valeant acquired had recently become the focus of public scrutiny the new york times article was the first time that the market was apprised that valeant’s steep revenue growth might be driven by something other than organic sales specifically the article questioned pearson’s claim that valeant was wellpositioned for growth even without price increases  in response to this news the price of valeant securities fell valeant common stock declined share or  from a price of share at the close of trading on october   to a price of share at the close of trading on october   case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    however valeant immediately took steps to attempt to dispel any suggestion that its public statements concerning its organic growth were materially misleading on october   the company released a statement entitled “valeant corrects misleading reports” seeking to refute allegations leveled against valeant by short sellers on the internet on october   pearson sent a letter to senator mccaskill in that letter pearson noted that “t i sperception in the media that valeant’s revenue growth for existing products has been driven primarily by price” this was a “misperception” according to pearson because “volume growth contributes significantly more than price for our us branded pharmaceutical business”  on october   after the markets closed valeant issued a press release announcing that it had received two subpoenas one from the us attorney’s office for the district of massachusetts and one from the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york the documents requested by these prosecutors included among other things materials relating to “pricing decisions” thus the market was notified that valeant was being investigated for potential criminal violations  in response to this news the price of valeant securities fell again valeant common stock declined share or  from a price of share at the close of trading on october   to a price of share at the close of trading on october    yet valeant still continued to deny any wrongdoing in the same press release pearson was quoted as saying “all of us at valeant firmly believe in maintaining strong regulatory and financial controls and believe we have operated our business in a fully compliant manner” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    on october   during trading hours valeant held an investor call to address its third quarter results and the scrutiny it was receiving from the government and the media during that call valeant disclosed that for  and through three quarters of  price hikes and not volume increases accounted for the majority of valeant’s revenue growth from its us branded pharmaceuticals portfolio specifically in  volume accounted for  of growth while prices increases accounted for  of growth in  as of the october  disclosure volume accounted for  of growth and price increases accounted for   valeant also for the first time acknowledged the existence of philidor apparently in response to a california state lawsuit against valeant that questioned the connection between valeant and philidor on the call pearson described valeant’s relationship with philidor as follows philidor one of our specialty pharmacy partners provides prescription services to patients across the country and provides administrative services for our copay cards and is a dispensary that fills prescriptions we have a contractual relationship with philidor and late last year we purchased an option to acquire philidor if we so choose given accounting rules we consolidate philidor’s financials inventory held at philidor remains on valeant’s books and is not included in the specialty pharmacy channel inventory for many of our dermatology products philidor and other specialty pharmacies dispense our medicine before adjudication of the reimbursement is finalized to ensure patients get their medicines prescribed quickly as a result we take on a risk for non reimbursement we understand that philidor provides services under our programs for commercially insured and cashpaying claims only any claim that would be reimbursed in whole or in part by government insurance is not eligible for our copay subsidy programs it does not restrict prescriptions it fills to any particular manufacturers it dispenses generic products as specified in the patient’s prescription or as requested by the patient case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    although valeant finally disclosed that it had a “contractual relationship with philidor” its disclosure was materially incomplete because it failed to disclose the true nature of the relationship between valeant and philidor ie that philidor effectively was a division of valeant that peddled valeant’s products only  in response to this news the price of valeant securities fell again valeant common stock declined share or  from a price of share at the close of trading on october   to a price of share at the close of trading on october    after the markets closed on october  the new york times published an article entitled “drug makers sidestep barriers on pricing” the article disclosed that philidor’s application for a license to operate in california had been denied because philidor had concealed its ties to valeant according to the article valeant used philidor to “keep the health system paying for highpriced drugs”  in response to this news the price of valeant securities dropped valeant common stock declined share or  from a price of share at the close of trading on october   to a price of share at the close of trading on october    plaintiffs liquidated their entire position in valeant common stock by october   having suffered huge losses in connection with the partial disclosures alleged above and as a result of defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact  over the rest of  and the first half of  more facts about philidor and valeant’s volume growth were publicly disclosed case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    for example on october   citron published a research article claiming that it had a “smoking gun” and asking the question “could this be the pharmaceutical enron” the citron report claimed that valeant was using a secret network of mailorder specialty pharmacies to force patients to purchase valeant medications the report claimed that philidor shared a phone number with other purportedly independent pharmacies citron concluded that “it appears to citron that valeantphilidor have created an entire network of phantom captive pharmacies”  valeant issued a press release seeking to downplay the accusations in the citron report the press release was titled “valeant pharmaceuticals responds to erroneous report”  on october   bmo capital markets corp “bmo” downgraded its guidance on valeant to “market perform” due in part to it having received no satisfactory explanation for valeant’s use of philidor and concealment of that relationship bmo – which had previously been bullish on valeant – found valeant’s relationship with philidor to be “questionable”  that same day bloomberg published an article entitled “valeant still has explaining to do citron’s left says” in the article bloomberg quoted the drug industry’s washington lobbying group pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america as describing valeant’s business strategy as “more reflective of a hedge fund than an innovative biopharmaceutical company” the article also quoted adam fein president of pembroke consulting inc as saying “what valeant was doing whether right or wrong was very very unusual and not consistent with practices that other pharmaceutical manufactures use”  on sunday october   the wall street journal published an article entitled “valeant and pharmacy more intertwined than thought” the article included more case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   details about valeant’s ties to philidor disclosing that several valeant employees had been sent to work at philidor and had used the pop culture aliases peter parker jack reacher and brian wilson the article also noted that valeant had used philidor to “fuel its business” philidor “can steer patients to valeant’s drugs rather than lessexpensive alternatives and then help negotiate reimbursements with insurers” the article revealed  on october   valeant released a page powerpoint presentation on philidor valeant disclosed among other things a how it used philidor to generate revenues through alternate fulfillment b that philidor represented  of valeant’s total revenue for the third quarter of  c that valeant had entered into the option purchase agreement with philidor in december  d that philidor had agreements with other pharmacies to distribute in california where philidor was not licensed e that valeant had long considered philidor a vie and f that its management and board of directors had toured philidor’s facilities prior to entering into the purchase option agreement  however this presentation still failed to disclose the full truth about philidor and was materially misleading to the extent it claimed that philidor was immaterial to valeant’s business  on october   after the markets closed the wall street journal published an article entitled “pharmacy’s sales tactics disclosed” the article revealed that philidor had been in engaging in highly questionable practices to sell valeant’s products  the next day while the markets were still open it was reported by dow jones newswire that cvscaremark – one of the largest pbm’s in the united states – had terminated philidor from its network of pharmacies case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    after the markets closed on october   the other two of the “big three” pbms – express scripts and optumrx – also cut ties with philidor  the next day friday october   valeant announced that it was severing its connections with philidor and that philidor would be closing its doors imminently in a statement released by valeant pearson was quoted as saying “the newest allegations about activities at philidor raise additional questions about the company’s business practices    we have lost confidence in philidor’s ability to continue in a manner that is acceptable to valeant and the patients and doctors we serve” however this statement – in which valeant tried to distance itself from philidor – was materially misleading because it did not reveal the full extent of valeant’s involvement with philidor and how material philidor was to valeant’s business  on november   it was disclosed that the senate had launched a formal probe into valeant’s business practices  after the markets closed on november   the wall street journal reported that pershing square – one of valeant’s largest shareholders – was considering the removal of pearson as ceo due to the turbulence surrounding valeant in addition it was disclosed that the head of pershing square bill ackman had requested that valeant management “come clean” and disclose the full extent of their knowledge regarding philidor  on november   valeant held an investor call to provide an update to the market during that call pearson disclosed that philidor had committed to cease operations by january   at the latest pearson also revealed the impact that the philidor scandal was having on valeant’s operations “in the very short term disruption in our dermatology business will be significant last week we asked philidor to stop adjudicating claims and to fill all prescriptions at no cost for the week” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    on november   bloomberg released an article warning of a “revenue squeeze” at valeant due to the loss of philidor and the scrutiny over drug price increases as a result valeant could breach important covenants to its lenders which would be disastrous for valeant and its shareholders  on november   bloomberg published another article providing further details on valeant’s relationship with philidor and how philidor peddled valeant products over cheaper generic alternatives  on november   bloomberg reported that congressman elijah cummings had demanded that pearson make the valeant employees involved with philidor available for interviews  before the market opened on december   an analyst at mizuho securities usa “mizuho” downgraded valeant from “buy” to “neutral” pointing to a lack of clarity in valeant’s disclosures  on december   valeant announced that pearson had left the company on medical leave on january   valeant announced that schiller – who had left his position as cfo in  but remained on the company’s board – would be taking over as interim ceo  on february   several news outlets reported on a wells fargo analyst’s detailed review of valeant among other things the wells fargo analyst questioned valeant’s claim that philidor accounted for only  of revenues given that the unwinding of that revenue from valeant’s financials resulted in a onethird reduction in earningspershare the analyst also found that valeant’s accounting did not match up to its performance accordingly the analyst concluded that valeant was at “substantial risk” of having misstated its financials case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    on february   while the markets were still open it was reported that valeant would likely be restating some of its financials based on its internal review of philidor on this news the price of valeant securities again fell precipitously  after the markets closed valeant issued a press release confirming that it expected to have to restate its financials  on february   valeant issued a press release announcing that pearson was returning from medical leave and that as a result it would reschedule its previously announced call for february  to discuss its fourth quarter  results  during trading hours on february   moody’s reported that it had placed valeant’s corporate credit rating “under review for downgrade” because of concerns about valeant’s operating performance  on march   before the market opened valeant announced that it was reducing its financial guidance for  as a result of the termination of its relationship with philidor making the materiality of philidor painfully obvious to investors in a release issued that same day valeant disclosed  million in “wind down” costs for philidor  on june   valeant announced its results for the first quarter of  the results were not good primarily because of the hit the company had taken in having to shut down its clandestine network of specialty pharmacies specifically revenues from valeant’s skin care products – the very products that valeant used philidor to peddle – were down  from the same quarter in  case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   ii defendants’ false and misleading statements and omissions a misrepresentations and omissions about valeant’s ties to philidor  valeant misleads investors about its alternate fulfillment program  throughout the relevant period defendants made several statements about the purported success of valeant’s alternate fulfillment program without disclosing the truth about that program – ie that valeant was secretly using philidor to steer patients to valeant products while concealing any links between valeant and philidor defendants’ decision to speak about the af program without disclosing valeant’s ties to and use of philidor rendered their statements about alternative fulfillment materially incomplete and misleading  on january   pearson and schiller held an investor call to discuss valeant’s financial guidance for  during that call pearson discussed the alternate fulfillment program “t o re we understand about it the more excited we get about it quite frankly because it’s not just a singular sort of initiative that there’s a while evolution being planned in terms of the stage i stage ii stage iii and there’s some exciting opportunities there that we are not going to give specifics of” later in in the call pearson spoke more about alternate fulfillment “t if it all works out will both help eliminate or get rid of non revenue producing or nonprofitable scripts but hopefully can be used to start generating truly profitable scripts through a different channel”  on february   pearson and schiller held an investor conference call where they again touted the benefits of the af program when asked however how the af program contributes to growth pearson stated “we have never given details    so when i can give details in terms of what’s flowing through full alternate fulfillment what’s not what we can reiterate is that all of our key brands in dermatology    are now growing” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    on may   pearson and schiller held an investor call to discuss valeant’s first quarter results during that call pearson was asked about the marketing of valeant’s dermatology products in response pearson referred to valeant’s alternate fulfillment program “w u ch more sophis t icated alternate fulfillment system that we’ve implemented in the us which is really helping    w’ve applied that to a number of our other products which is also helping in terms of the growth”  the statements above in paragraphs  through  which caused valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated prices were materially misleading and incomplete because they failed to disclose the covert network of specialty pharmacies that valeant was developing to implement its af program valeant’s secretive deployment of philidor to peddle its highpriced products over cheaper generic equivalents subjected valeant to serious regulatory and reimbursement risks that would materialize if other participants in the industry knew of valeant’s relationship with philidor had they known that philidor was effectively a division of valeant large pbms would have scrutinized and denied reimbursement requests from philidor because of the likelihood that the specialty pharmacy was just a shill for valeant this was subsequently confirmed when the three largest pbms dropped philidor from their networks after philidor’s relationship with valeant was revealed in late   valeant’s failure to disclose its connection to philidor prior to the purchase option agreement  after forming philidor in january  valeant

growth was driven by organic factors ie increased sales volume however defendants’ statements were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose that valeant’s steep growth was actually caused by valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring new medications and then raising the prices on those drugs  on january   pearson and schiller held an investor call to discuss valeant’s financial guidance for  during the conference pearson stated that valeant’s case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   revenue growth was driven through organic growth of valeant’s existing products “valeant’s growth in revenuesis a result of achieving strong organic growth in a fiscally responsible manner for the products that we already own    ”  on may   valeant held an investor call to respond to accusations by allergan that valeant’s business model was based on price hikes and was not sustainable in adamantly denying allergan’s claims pearson told investors that valeant “has delivered strong organic growth since i have been here”  also on may   pearson participated in the sanford c bernstein strategic decisions conference pearson was asked several questions during the conference about the drivers behind valeant’s growth after noting that valeant’s ability to raise prices was capped for certain products he told attendees we growth and the vast majority of our growth on a global basis    is volume”  on june   pearson and schiller held an investor call to address additional questions raised by allergan about valeant’s business in trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by valeant on that call pearson again stated that volume not price was the primary driver of valeant’s growth pearson suggested that when valeant breaks down its organic growth into “volume and price parts” “i suspect it will be surprising to people because i think volume is a much larger piece of our organic growth than most people would assume it is”  on january   pearson and schiller held an investor call to discuss valeant’s guidance for  during that call pearson reflected on valeant’s growth stating “our robust organic growth profile is evidenced by our ability to deliver doubledigit organic growth not only in  and  but strong organic growth for the foreseeable future” case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    on april   pearson and schiller held an investor call in connection with the release of valeant’s first quarter financial results during the call one analyst asked pearson to quantify how price and volume contributed to valeant’s first quarter growth the analyst asked pearson “if you could just quantify a little bit how much was price versus volume that contributed to growth in q” pearson responded in terms of price volume actually volume was greater than price in terms of our growth outside the united states it’s all volume     and in the us it’s shifting more to volume than price and we expect that to continue     a lot of our prices for most of our products are negotiated with managed care and there’s only a limited amount of price we can take    so it’s primarily volume      during the week of may   rbc capital markets hosted valeantrelated investor events in canada at which pearson spoke during those events the source of valeant’s growth was questioned several times in discussing valeant’s growth pearson stated the following “we’ve been accused of raising price but our organic growth is more volumebased than pricebased and will continue to be”  on september   valeant filed a form k with the sec that attached a letter that pearson had sent that day to valeant’s employees in that letter pearson made several statements about valeant’s purported organic growth being driven by volume increases and not price increases specifically pearson stated “valeant is wellpositioned for strong organic growth even assuming little to no price increases” pearson further stated “valeant’s core operating principles include a focus on volume growth     the majority of our portfolio will continue to deliver strong volumebased organic growth and is not dependent on price increases”  the statements above in paragraphs  through  which caused valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated prices were materially false and misleading because case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   valeant’s growth was not driven by organic volume growth but by valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring pharmaceuticals and immediately raising the prices on those drugs indeed when appearing before the us senate on april   pearson admitted that for each quarter except one between january   and september   “pricing has driven more growth than volume” furthermore in a may   email to pearson schiller stated that for the first quarter of  price represented “about ” of valeant’s growth on february   schiller testified before congress and confirmed that  of valeant’s growth in the first quarter of  was the result of price increases and not expanded market share in addition on october   valeant released a presentation showing that its revenue growth for  and the first three quarters of  in the us branded prescription portfolio was due more to price hikes that volume increases iii summary of defendants’ scienter  plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every paragraph contained above as if set forth herein  defendants pearson and schiller acted with scienter with respect to the materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact set forth above because they knew or at the very least recklessly disregarded that those statements were false when made as the most senior executives of valeant during the relevant time period pearson’s and schiller’s scienter is imputable to valeant  pearson and schiller knew or at the very least recklessly disregarded prior to october   that philidor was effectively a division of valeant whose sole purpose was to steer patients toward valeant products even when much cheaper generic alternatives were available in fact pearson and schiller have never denied such knowledge but rather admitted that they did not disclose the arrangement with philidor because they believed it was a case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   competitive advantage as explained above pearson frequently touted the benefits of valeant’s alternate fulfillment program – which consisted of philidor and its secret network of pharmacies – but refused to ever discuss “details” about that program  valeant has also disclosed that prior to entering into the purchase option agreement with philidor in december  the majority of valeant’s board of directors – of which both pearson and schiller were members – toured philidor in person and that pearson and schiller were responsible for the decision to enter into the purchase option agreement with philidor  pearson and schiller admitted in an october   presentation to investors that it was they who determined “the appropriate accounting treatment” for philidor in doing so pearson and schiller recklessly disregarded the requirements of asc  and sab topic  which required them to disclose the “nature purpose size and activities” of philidor how philidor was financed significant judgments and assumptions made in determining whether valeant needed to consolidate philidor andor disclose information about its involvement with philidor the “nature of and changes in the risks associated with” valeant’s involvement with philidor and how valeant’s involvement with philidor affected valeant’s “financial position financial performance and cash flows” see asc a asc  valeant was also required to disclose philidor as a distinct sales channel in the mda in valeant’s periodic filings with the sec see sab topic b  pearson and schiller’s assertion in the october   presentation that they were not required to disclose philidor because valeant’s sales to philidor did not account for more than  of its revenues is nothing more than a pretext for their reckless disregard of the accounting rules philidor was not a customer of valeant it was effectively operating as a case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   division of valeant once philidor’s financials were consolidated with valeant the notion that philidor had to meet the  customer sales threshold for disclosure is rendered even more absurd because at that point even valeant considered philidor to be a part of valeant and not a customer  pearson and schiller knew that the illegitimate sales channel they created was highly material to valeant’s business indeed their claim that philidor was not material to valeant is belied by the adverse financial impact that philidor’s closure had on valeant and by the market’s negative reaction to the several disclosures about philidor from october   and into the middle of   the reason that pearson and schiller intentionally concealed philidor is apparent the concealment of valeant’s relationship with philidor was essential to valeant being able to channel sales through philidor so long as the pbms had no idea about the connection between philidor and valeant they had no reason to suspect any collusion of course when they eventually found out about valeant’s deceptive use of philidor to move valeant products the three major pbms – which account for  of the market – immediately cut ties with philidor  pearson and schiller knew or at the very least recklessly disregarded that between january   and september   valeant’s steep revenue growth was driven not by organic volume increases but rather primarily by valeant’s unsustainable practice of acquiring medications and drastically increasing their prices indeed both pearson and schiller have since admitted that valeant’s growth was the result of price increases and not what was previously represented to the market  on april   pearson appeared before congress in his prepared remarks pearson confessed that valeant had “made mistakes” and that he personally was too aggressive case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   in seeking price increases to drive revenue “the company was too aggressive – and i as its leader was too aggressive – in pursuing price increases on certain drugs let me state plainly that it was a mistake to pursue and in hindsight i regret pursuing transactions where a central premise was planned increase in the prices of the medicines    ”  during that hearing pearson was questioned by senator mccaskill about whether growth was driven by price rather than volume between the first quarter of  and the third quarter of  for all but one quarter in response pearson admitted that “yes pricing has driven more growth than volume”  on february   schiller appeared before congress as valeant’s acting ceo schiller admitted to the congressional panel that  of valeant’s growth in the first quarter of  was the result of price increases and not expanded market share  indeed valeant’s practice – at the behest of pearson and schiller – of driving revenue growth through price increases formed the core of its operations rather than follow the traditional model of developing new drugs by investing in rd pearson and schiller implemented a strategy of acquiring already developed drugs and increasing revenues through price hikes pearson and schiller were thus well aware that organic volume increases were not the primary driver of valeant’s revenue growth  as the ceo and cfo of valeant respectively pearson and schiller were acutely aware of what was driving valeant’s growth this is corroborated by internal valeant documents for example on may   schiller sent pearson an email with the subject “price volume” in that email schiller stated “last night one of the investors asked about price vs volume for q excluding isuprel and nitropress price represented about  of our growth if you include isuprel and nitropressabout ” despite receiving case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   this emails from schiller pearson continued to make misstatements about organic volumedriven growth  in  both pearson and schiller were forced out of valeant iv presumption of reliance  plaintiffs intend to rely upon the presumption of reliance established by the fraud onthemarket doctrine in that among other things a defendants made public misrepresentations or failed to disclose material facts during the relevant time period b the omissions and misrepresentations were material c valeant securities traded in efficient markets d the misrepresentations alleged would tend to induce a reasonable investor to misjudge the value of the valeant securities and e plaintiffs purchased valeant securities between the time defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose material facts and the time when the true facts were disclosed without knowledge of the misrepresented or omitted facts  the market for valeant common stock was open welldeveloped and efficient at all relevant times as a result of the aforementioned materially false and misleading statements and failures to disclose valeant common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the relevant period the artificial inflation continued until the time the market fully came to realize the nature and extent of the valeant’s misrepresentations and omissions concerning valeant’s organic growth and philidor  at all relevant times the market for valeant common stock was efficient for the following reasons among others a valeant filed periodic reports with the sec b valeant common stock met the requirements for listing and was listed and actively traded on the nyse c numerous analysts followed valeant and d valeant regularly communicated with public investors via established market communication mechanisms including through regular disseminations of press releases on the major news wire services and through other wideranging case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   public disclosures such as communications with the financial press securities analysts and other similar reporting services  plaintiffs relied on the market price of valeant’s common stock which reflected all the information in the market including the misstatements by defendants  plaintiffs are also entitled to a presumption of reliance under affiliate ute citizens of utah v united states  us   because the claims asserted herein against defendants are also predicated upon omissions of material facts which there was a duty to disclose v loss causation  defendants’ wrongful conduct as alleged herein directly and proximately caused the economic loss suffered by plaintiffs during the time that plaintiffs purchased valeant common stock set forth in exhibits a through b the market price of those securities was artificially inflated as a direct result of defendants’ materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material facts as a series of partial but inadequate disclosures was issued correcting the prior false and misleading statements as detailed above in paragraphs  through  the price of those securities declined precipitously and plaintiffs were damaged  defendants concealed the existence of philidor and valeant’s relationship to philidor in doing so they concealed the foreseeable risk to valeant’s business if market participants discovered the true nature of the relationship between valeant and philidor ie that philidor effectively was a division of valeant and that valeant through philidor had created an entire network of phantom captive pharmacies that valeant was using to peddle its products beginning with the october   partial disclosure of philidor by valeant that foreseeable risk gradually materialized thus causing the price of valeant securities to decline as detailed above case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid    defendants misrepresented to investors that valeant’s revenue growth was driven primarily by organic volume growth in doing so they concealed the foreseeable risk that valeant’s rapid growth was unsustainable if it was driven primarily by price increases on newly acquired drugs beginning with the october   partial disclosure that valeant may not be wellpositioned for growth even without price increases that foreseeable risk gradually materialized thus causing the price of valeant securities to decline as detailed above vi no safe harbor  the statutory safe harbor provided for forwardlooking statements under certain circumstances does not apply to any of the allegedly false statements pleaded in this complaint the specific statements pleaded herein were not “forwardlooking statements” nor were they identified as “forwardlooking statements” when made nor was it stated with respect to any of the statements forming the basis of this complaint that actual results “could differ materially from those projected” to the extent there were any forwardlooking statements there were no meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the purportedly forwardlooking statements alternatively to the extent that the statutory safe harbor does apply to any forwardlooking statements pleaded herein defendants are liable for those false forwardlooking statements because at the time each of those forwardlooking statements was made the particular speaker knew that the particular forwardlooking statement was false andor the forwardlooking statement was authorized andor approved by an executive officer of valeant who knew that those statements were false when made case cvmaslhg document  filed  page  of  pageid   vii fraudbased causes of action first cause of action

respect to valeant’s operations business performance and prospects from the investing public including concealing the existence of certain information about philidor that they had a legal obligation to disclose and misstating that valeant’s growth derived from organic volume increases by concealing these material facts from investors valeant pearson and schiller supported the artificially inflated price of valeant’s common stock  the dissemination of the materially false and misleading information and failure to disclose material facts as set forth above artificially inflated the market price of valeant’s common stock in ignorance of the fact that the market prices were artificially inflated and relying directly or indirectly upon the materially false and misleading statements

believed them to be true had plaintiffs known the truth with respect to the business operations performance and prospects of valeant which was concealed by defendants plaintiffs would not have purchased valeant common stock or if they had purchased such securities they would not have done so at the artificially inflated prices that they paid  by virtue of the foregoing defendants valeant pearson and schiller have violated section b of the exchange act and rule b promulgated thereunder  as a direct and proximate result of defendants valeant’s pearson’s and schiller’s wrongful conduct plaintiffs have suffered damages in connection with their transactions in the company’s common stock  plaintiffs have brought this claim within two years of discovery of the violations alleged herein

statement notwithstanding that valeant had been operating philidor effectively as a division of the company for the entirety of   these statements which caused valeant securities to trade at artificially inflated prices were materially false misleading and incomplete because the fact that philidor was a material unconsolidated vie required defendants to disclose certain information about

specifically valeant was required to disclose philidor as a “c e nts into    a sales channel    that could be expected to have a significant effect on future sales or sale returns” by the third quarter of  sales through philidor were accounting for at least approximately  of valeant’s revenues and likely more given the substantial decline in valeant’s revenue following philidor’s closure thus valeant was required to disclose its use of philidor as a changing trend in a sales channel that was expected to have a significant effect on valeant’s sales  the  k was also materially false and
