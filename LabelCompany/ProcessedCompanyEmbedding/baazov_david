shareholders’ asking price had been just too high he explainedbaazov frozen outlast month amaya announced it had reorganized its debt to free up spare cash one of the conditions of this refinancing

debt under the credit agreement for the first lien term loans” amaya warnedamaya borrowed billions when it acquired the rational group’s assets including pokerstars in  which means the lenders’ threat

baazov chief executive officer of amaya please go ahead mr baazov david baazov thank you operator good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating on todays call i am joined on the call today by daniel sebag our chief financial officer our  results were released today and are available on sedar where you can also find our financial statements and mdas transformation to a global leader an online consumer technology was completed in  with the successful integration of pokerstars and full tilt into amaya this is evident in our record performance and continued strength during the fourth quarter and full year of  the strength and vitality of the pokerstars and full tilt businesses and the millions of kyc verified customers who trust the brands provide amaya with a unique consumer web platform to build upon our success in gaming by adding new verticals expanding to new markets and reaching new consumers this robust and proven technology platform also provides ample room to scale through organic customer growth as well as through strategic acquisitions that expand our customer base and our consumer offerings ill provide more on our future growth strategies in a few minutes but first i want to focus on our overall performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year during the year we generated record results in revenues adjusted ebitda adjusted eps and cash flow from operations this was driven by our consumer business which we refer to as bc and is comprised primarily of pokerstars and full tilt growth came primarily through increased online gaming revenue and sound expense management while still making investments and adding personnel to the business including in it and rd to prepare for future growth initiatives as a reminder we completed the purchase of our bc business during the third quarter on august  therefore results for q reflect the full quarter of contribution from the bc business in the fourth quarter bc business revenues comprised greater than  of overall revenues the consumer business is amayas core platform for growth in recognition of that we have initiated a process to explore alternatives to divest our bb business with the aim of maximizing shareholder value by generating cash to facilitate debt repayment andor share buybacks  was a year of transition for the company however it continued to grow its leadership position in poker which is the core business for the company it increased its market share launched exciting new products and continued to expand into emerging growth areas such as asia and latin america this continued global growth in poker reflects the expertise of the management team and the business and the fantastic services it provides pokerstars continues to execute on its plan to introduce poker as a competitive game of skill in emerging markets while identifying opportunities to bring new players of the game through product innovation and creative consumer marketing programs  and beyond will not be different we are a pokerfirst business and will build upon and leverage the popularity of our poker brands and our operational excellence to deliver future growth our goal is to double the poker sector in the next five years we aim to drive growth in three primary ways one the most important driver will be entering new markets where we currently have little or no penetration in realmoney poker second creating consumer demand and excitement through innovative marketing and promotions third continuing to innovate the product to attract more players and reactivate lapsed players let me talk a little bit about new and emerging geographies and newly regulated jurisdictions notably the company is making investments to grow its business in asia which is currently an emerging market for the game of poker but is historically a strong gambling market recent poker pro and celebrity endorsements and the launch of pokerstarssponsored live poker events and branded poker rooms and casinos in new areas of asia such as manila are recent examples of the strategy these initiatives stimulate consumer interest in poker and establish strategic business relationships with partners regulators and governments in emerging markets ahead of potential regulation of online poker in the primary market of europe there is an ongoing trend toward countries establishing independent regulatory and licensing regimes pokerstars holds licenses in  european jurisdictions including most recently the united kingdom the business is opportunistically looking to leverage its scale reputation and expertise to grow its business including through targeted marketing efforts designed to grow market share in jurisdictions which have recently established gaming duties or other taxes where we expect competitors to scale back marketing efforts outside those continents the company is aggressively pursuing growth opportunities in the americas notably populist countries in south america and in the united states where we are actively lobbying for online gaming legislation in a variety of key states including california and pennsylvania and we continue to work with the new jersey regulator toward final approval to launch our consumer business in that state where a bb online casino business already operates while geographic expansion is anticipated to be the biggest driver of the growth of poker in future years the business is also looking to grow organically through new and innovative marketing campaigns including the use of endorsements from global celebrities compelling consumer promotions to increase the popularity of online poker finally we are filling our innovation pipeline with exciting new games and player promotions that we anticipate will reactivate lapsed players excite new poker players and gain more play from existing players this formula has evidence from the successful launch and promotion of pokerstars new spin  go tournaments which combines fast play with various jackpotstyle payouts to players and was first successful on full tilt as jackpots in those id like to let you know after less than six months of play pokerstars held its  millionth spin  go tournament this month pokerstars and full tilt plan to launch more you game variants improve upon their already industryleading mobile poker offering and implement social and engagement layers in the realmoney offerings poker is and will continue to be the primary focus however we plan to leverage the poker consumer base of more than  million cumulative registrations to build additional significant new revenue streams with other gaming and nongaming offerings pokerstars and full tilt have already begun strategically rolling out other gaming offerings in order to attract new customers and serve the estimated  to  of our existing customers who already have casino or sports book accounts on competitors platforms full tilt launched casino table games in february  and has bolstered this offering with the introduction of live dealer games baccarat and online slots from bestofbreed thirdparty providers including amayas online casino games provider having established a relatively full casino offering full tilt continues to achieve a crosssell percentage to eligible players of greater than  with the games generating a gross yield approximately double its poker yield pokerstars introduced casino table games to players in the regulated spanish market in late q before rolling them out globally as part of a voluntary upgrade of the pokerstars software in late q the results were similarly strong with yield multiples approximately  times the poker yield despite only blackjack and roulette being available only two games the software upgrade became mandatory for all pokerstars players this year making blackjack and roulette games available to all eligible active users in q pokerstars rolled out live dealer games and will soon introduce baccarat and online slots as it anticipates adding more games in  we are expanding these games to be available on mobile apps in certain jurisdictions and well introduce for the first time a browserbased casino in  this will create opportunities to make casino a customer acquisition channel in its own right offering new consumers the advantages of a shared online wallet with the most trusted brand in online gaming the initial experience with casino has been that a significant majority of the casino wagering has been on top of rather than cannibalizing the preexisting poker card i am happy to say this morning pokerstars took its very first sports bets as it began rolling out a beta version of its sports betting offering in select markets with the intention of expanding across the dotcom global network through the next two quarters of  sports betting is a very large addressable market for the business and is a product that much of the current player base have been asking pokerstars to provide for some time the business believes there is a strong crossover potential between the verticals and pokerstars wants to grow the poker economy by attracting players from elsewhere who are currently making sports bets with other providers the business anticipates this will help attract more recreational players to pokerstars poker games notably in conjunction with the beta launch of sports betting players will be able to access their pokerstars accounts via their web browser for the first time account holders will be able to securely log into the pokerstars website with their existing pokerstars credentials to access sports betting and their pokerstars cashier the intention is to develop this service for casino and poker in the near future we have also taken the strategic decision to enter the daily fantasy sports category and are pursuing parallel tracks of internal development and strategic acquisitions we expect to provide more details on this strategy in the second half  but see a clear crossover from poker and daily fantasy sports we believe casino and sportsbook are verticals that will respond well to mobile offerings we have therefore been impressed with the business ability to continue to drive new customer acquisition through its leading mobile offerings which are available for both ios and android devices the business has seen strong growth over the past three years in players deposits and gross gaming revenue coming from its mobile applications almost  of pokerstars new customer acquisitions were obtained via mobile in q at the end of  cumulative registration had grown to more than  million ill now turn to call over to danny for a look at financial results and outlook daniel sebag thanks david starting with our top line revenues were  million in the fourth quarter of  compared to  million in q of  with growth driven by the consolidation of revenues from the two businesses we acquired in  specifically the bc business comprised primarily of pokerstars and full tilt which we acquired on august  and diamond game which we acquired in february for the quarter the bc business comprised approximately  of overall consolidated revenue moving on to expenses our total expenses increased to  million from  million in q  with the increase driven by higher selling general and administrative expenses related primarily to the consolidation of the bc business and diamond game and higher financial expenses which primarily related to interest on increased leverage adjusted ebitda in the quarter was  million versus  million in q of  with the vast majority generated by the bc business a reconciliation to our ifrs ebitda and net income is included in our earnings release adjusted net earnings in the quarter was  million or  per diluted share versus  million or  per diluted share in q  with the increase reflecting the contribution of the acquired bc business a reconciliation to our ifrs net income is included in our earnings release the corporation generated cash flows from operating activities of  million compared to  million in q  our financial statements obviously do not include the performance of the bc business for the full year of  as we only acquired it on august  however we can say that revenues for the bc business in  grew approximately  over  to  billion this excludes onetime revenues reported in the fourth quarter of  the growth was driven by increased poker revenues and other income including casino revenues adjusted ebitda grew  over  to approximately  million growth was driven by the increase in revenues including high margin income streams and expense management looking back at our fullyear results versus our previously announced  guidance on november   amaya affirmed it’s previously announced guidance for the full year of  with the revenue of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda of  million to  million with results expected at the high end of the range the actual full year  revenues were  million and adjusted ebitda of  million looking ahead for fullyear  guidance today amaya announced that it anticipates fullyear revenues in the range of  billion to  billion this is based on a usd to cad exchange rate of  as that closed on march   assumptions include a full year of revenues from both amayas bc business which comprises approximately  of revenues and its bb business which is approximately  of revenues bc revenue growth is anticipated to be driven by an increase in bc poker casino and sports book business revenues amaya does not currently separate out revenues for the bc business various product lines but may consider doing so in the future once casino and sports book reach a stage it determines to be material enough to do so adjusted ebitda of  million to  million this is based on a usd to cad exchange rate of  as of close on march   assumptions include a full year of adjusted ebitda from the bc business which comprises approximately  of adjusted ebitda and the bb business which is approximately  of adjusted ebitda bc growth to be driven by bc casino sports book and the core poker business which is anticipated to offset an estimated  million in new valueadded taxes and uk point of consumption taxes on the core poker business this is net of vat and poc taxes on casino and sports book and an approximate  million impact from the reduction in purchasing power of global depositing currencies relative to the us dollardenominated games ill touch on this in a minute excluding the impact of vat point of consumption and the fx impact adjusted ebitda guidance would have been on a usd basis approximately  million to  million dollars three pro forma adjusted net earnings of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share this is a pro forma figure as is the divestiture of the entire bb business occurred as at december   and is designed to give fuller insight into the anticipated profitability of amayas core bc business finally an adjusted net leverage ratio of  to  turns at december   adjusted net leverage ratio is defined as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted ebitda but after giving effect to the anticipated divestitures of our bb assets for clarity adjusted net debt means amayas anticipated total financial leverage minus cash for this measure amayas cash balance includes cash that is currently being set aside for the deferred payment that is the final piece of the purchase price for the ultra group payable by  the cash amount though does not assume any potential cash generated from the exercise of warrants that have maturity dates extending beyond  we currently anticipate q will be our clueless quarter of the year likely about  of the anticipated full year figures as the new verticals rolling out this year will provide benefits to the top and bottom line and marketing initiatives and promotions which we have been making investments for already begin to launch in the second and future quarters i will refer you to our cautionary comments on forwardlooking statements and nonifrs measures announced at the beginning of the call id like to provide a bit of clarity on currency at this time as it relates to the bc business pokerstars and full tilt are global businesses greater than  of the businesses comes from the european union due to this strong presence approximately half the deposits made on the platforms are made in euros which is by far the largest depositing currency however outside of the ringfence markets of france italy and spain which represent approximately  of the business the vast majority of realmoney poker game play occurs in us dollars therefore the recent decline in global currencies against the us dollar reduces the purchasing power of the global player base which can impact revenues as calculated in usd though it may not in amayas reporting currency of canadian dollars as the canadian dollar also declined relative to the usd as it has additionally the percentage drop in the global currency versus the us dollar does not typically result in a commensurate drop in usd revenue from that jurisdiction as there is often a point of resistance due to the engagement of the player base for example from the beginning of this year to march  gross deposits in usd decreased just over  however on a domestic currency basis deposits actually increased approximately  the bc business employees a hedging strategy to mitigate payment processing currency risks including forward swaps amaya has also recently entered into crosscurrency swap agreements designed to improve matching of the currency denomination of the assets and liabilities of amayas bc business essentially meaning if the euro drops relative to the usd below the rate of  amayas debt becomes cheaper additionally we anticipate the swaps will result in lower interest payments on existing debt as the synthetic euro denominated debt has fixed euro interest payments at an average rate of  instead of a usd interest payment bearing a minimum floating interest rate of  but which could be higher if libor were derived above  the swaps relate to our usd  billion sevenyear firstlien term loan secured on august   the swap agreements have a stated termination date of five years and have a notional amount of more than  billion dollars ill now turn to call back to david david baazov thanks danny as you can see the company is delivering on the high expectations we had for the pokerstars acquisition and our transformation i am particularly proud of managements ability to perform very well despite numerous significant potential distractions including the management changes related to amayas ownership the launch of significant new products adjusting to the requirements of a listed company and the ongoing review of trading activity in the companys shares prior to the pokerstars acquisition being conducted by quebec securities regulators these are all significant management challenges that we are dealing with very successfully as our results demonstrate i do want to address the ongoing amf investigation briefly at this time i do not have any additional information regarding the substance of the investigation but i can provide you with these key facts amaya thoroughly reviewed the relevant internal activities around the ultra group acquisition and has found no evidence of any violation of canadian securities laws or regulations nor has the company been provided with any evidence that any executive directors or employees violated any securities regulations the amf investigation is to our knowledge the only investigation into the trading of our shares we continue to cooperate with the amf and respond to requests by all relevant parties we are confident that once reviews are complete the amf will reach the same conclusion that we have if there were any violations of canadian securities laws they were not perpetrated by the company officers or directors the corporation intends to provide further updates on the investigation when it is permitted turning our attention briefly to the future id like to go over a few recent corporate developments as we previously indicated we are working on a dual listing which is intended to be completed before october of  but which we expect to complete earlier than that as a global consumer internet company we have determined the most appropriate location is on the nasdaq in new york city and we have therefore applied for a listing on the nasdaq global select market we look forward to providing more details in the near future we continue to execute on our previously stated goal of divesting our bb assets in a way that delivers the greatest shareholder value a recent announcement on the spinoff of diamond game and the proposed sale of cadillac jack are consistent with this strategy we expect to provide further updates on the divestiture process of our other bb business in the near future with the divestiture process well underway we are focused on our growth strategy of expanding the existing business organically and through strategic acquisitions that will allow us to leverage our current platform while adding new product new geographies and new consumers again its been a record year for amaya and we believe we have rewarded our shareholders by executing against the strategic vision that continues to come into sharper focus even as we grow and we believe will bring even greater opportunities for the future i am just going to go off script for a second and id just like to thank all the employees at cadillac jack for their tremendous efforts and accomplishments in a little over two years that amaya has owned the business im sure theres a lot there are probably too many individuals to name but mauro franic and sigmund lee if you are listening youve really done a tremendous job and provided great leadership at that business and the sale comes with some mixed emotions for me as i have truly enjoyed working with them and with all of cadillac jack in achieving success that we have at this point i would like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions thank you all questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of eyal ofir from dundee capital your line is open eyal ofir thanks congratulations guys on the results and the strong guidance david baazov thank you daniel sebag thanks eyal ofir first off just in your prepared remarks you discussed how full tilt launched i think both the table games and slots but the pokerstars platform has not gone into slots yet can you just talk about what youve launched what jurisdictions or what percentage you have actually hit i guess with the pokerstars rollout into casino what should we expect for the rest of  and obviously the yield here is fairly significant so should we anticipate i guess in the back half in terms of the yield on casino  what should we expect there as well david baazov eyal what i would say is that currently all weve launched from an online casino perspective is blackjack and roulette late in the first quarter we also launched live dealer some table games but we expect to launch baccarat and some slots in i would say the next  days and were going to continue filling up our full casino offering and i would say it will be full we expect in q at the same time the only other offering outside of casino that we recently launched sports betting which was today eyal ofir okay and then the sports betting you talked about the beta launch today when should we anticipate the rollout for i guess the  of your market  how should we expect that to hit over the year david baazov we are saying that thats going to be done our expectation is it will be the next two quarters you are looking at by the end of q the full launch whether it happens sooner its possible but right now what we are going to say is we take a similar approach to what we did with casino if you take a look at the crosssell percentage and the yield that i mentioned during the call thats with blackjack and roulette thats two games and thats what we are already doing eyal ofir okay thats great and then just looking ahead into  obviously you gave some pretty strong numbers in the pro forma for  on the bottom line you guys are making significant investments here on marketing as we see in the numbers in this quarter but also your commentary how should we think about the business growth as you turn on  what should we think about from an earning standpoint as well as we are modeling this out thanks david baazov im going to let danny touch on this a bit but i would say from my perspective we expect strong growth thats expected to be greater than  danny daniel sebag its a bit early to tell but i expect that to be the case eyal ofir okay great and then just obviously you guys are heading into asia and other jurisdictions could you just talk about what the regulatory landscape  whats going on in asia right now in specific jurisdictions also in the us has been obviously a headline obviously the investor base is looking at potentially you guys entering the us market you talk about new jersey the status there and california what are your thoughts on the currently billing – bills are and then the progress in other states david baazov eyal thats like an eightpoint question by the way so to talk a little bit about asia and what we expect there we are seeing  we are working what we could say at this time is that we are working with regulators in some of these asian countries and governments to come in and provide for and regulate online poker we are strategically working in select jurisdictions with large population bases where we feel that there is a strong demand for poker as it relates to new jersey california and other states we are as i said actively lobbying i think its very public and clear about the partnership and the relationship we have with our coalition in the state of california which we are very very pleased with and i have to say they are true partners in every word in every sense as it relates to new jersey i would say that we feel this is coming we would expect to receive and launch i would say in the next quarter eyal ofir great ill pass the line thank you operator our next question comes from the line of robert young from canaccord your line is open robert young hi good morning thanks for the detailed outlook thats great to see i was hoping that you could give us a sense  bring it back to the poker business and give us a sense of what the organic growth of the rational group poker businesses were in q and how you expect that to develop into q now that we are at the end of that quarter and maybe at the same time clarify what you said that in q you were expecting that to be  of the full year is that revenue ebitda  what exactly is that and ive got a followup david baazov i would say the growth is midsingle digits and in terms of what we said  danny  what you are saying in terms of q if you want to clarify that daniel sebag yes q is obviously theres a lot of new games that are going to be coming online  just new verticals new markets q is really a quarter where we are making a lot of investments so we expect q to be the weakest quarter of the entire year representing approximately  of our guidance david baazov so rob just to quantify if the anticipated full launches of products  and what ive been mentioning probably in q that maybe perhaps some people havent taken note of was the fact that theres a strong window of opportunity this calendar year given that there is the introduction of vat poc we clearly see marketing costs being driven down for people to be able to have their ebitda bridge – their lowering marketing tasks so one of the initiatives that i said that we would be undertaking is increasing it so if we are investing in marketing costs to get a benefit in q well you make that investment in q robert young okay so when you say  thats an ebitda metric then david baazov right robert young okay and then my followup will be related to the gross yield that you provided on casino you said it was around  times poker yield is that a blended number is that on the crosssold players you are seeing or is that on new players maybe if you could give us just a sense of what the yield per poker player to dimension that that would be helpful david baazov id say its on a blended number rob what was the second part of your question was robert young is there a – can you give us a sense of what the yield per player on poker is david baazov we cant we havent provided that robert young okay and then the last question for me you said that you are going to be poker first but you also noted that you were planning some nongaming offerings i was wondering what does that mean is that branding how should we take those two statements together david baazov id have to say youd have to stay tuned robert young okay ill pass it on then operator our next question comes from the line of ralph garcea from cantor fitzgerald your line is open ralph garcea good morning i just wanted to clarify that  again for q is that also on your revenue or just on ebitda as  of the fullyear number daniel sebag it actually is yes ralph garcea  of both revenue and ebitda and why im asking is its going to be the second full quarter for you guys what sort of seasonality are you seeing through q on the pokerstars side and also on the casino with a limited launch you had from a seasonality perspective daniel sebag from a seasonality perspective id say that typically q is the strongest and is best but when danny  i just want to point out when danny is saying  its  of our fullyears revenue which is growing thats happening in q so you are still seeing growth ralph garcea and on the – its the first time you sort of mentioned the fantasy sports side of the business have you guys already developed the product or are you just going through that initial stage and youll release a beta in the second half of the year whats the planned rollout david baazov the goal is to be up before the nfl season starts we clearly see a strong demand for it a lot of the specifically us players that were formerly pokerstars players would like to see us launch fantasy sports so i would say that thats the goal really launching it by the nfl season its a clear strong crossover with poker and given the size of our database you couldnt actually acquire somebody and leverage their entire platform because nobodys software that weve seen can currently support our volume that we would have if we launched fantasy sports ralph garcea okay and then on the currency side you are using  for the us dollar what currency or what exchange rate are you using for the euro in the guidance daniel sebag im using an average of  per euro to usd ralph garcea okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david mcfadgen from cormark securities your line is open david mcfadgen hi sorry danny just a couple of questions on your prepared remarks you talked about the bc revenue in  as being  billion up  year over year was that a us number daniel sebag thats a canadian dollars number david mcfadgen thats a canadian dollar number okay and that excludes some onetime revenue that stars pulled into their results daniel sebag exactly in  there was some onetime revenues that resulted – there was a change in accounting policy in  in q that resulted in onetime revenues that were factored out of our analysis david mcfadgen okay and thats the dormant accounts daniel sebag that is it david mcfadgen okay and can you provide us any color on tax implications for cadillac jack and diamond game individually daniel sebag yes so as it relates to that transaction obviously we have some color but until we complete the transaction i cant really give any guidance on the ultimate tax impact david mcfadgen okay and then just one additional one if i may also in your prepared remarks you talked about q  the growth of deposits decreased  i wasnt able to follow along can you just provide some color on that daniel sebag so on a domestic basis currencies are actually up on a us basis when you covert the actual domestic deposits into usd they are down because of the movement of the usd relative to the euro david mcfadgen okay daniel sebag so the domestic players are increasing their deposits by  in their actual local currency so it indicates poker is robust david mcfadgen but then when you convert it back into canadian you gain some of that back right david baazov that is correct david mcfadgen okay thats it for me thanks operator our next question comes from the line of steve li from ias your line is open steve li so first question you guys have a relatively big market share on the poker side going forward what are the challenges to maintain that market share or even to increase it is it through more marketing spend or is it through more product innovation david baazov id say its both i would say that given the window of opportunity for this calendar year with the introduction of that poc et cetera we see the cost of acquiring an online casino player actually coming down a bit which it hasnt done so in more than the last five years so we are spending more from a marketing perspective this calendar year while at the same time clearly with product innovation you actually grow your player base as you can see with spin  go we plan to do both steve li great so longterm what are your trends do you see that trend to continue where do you think your cost of acquisition of new customers is coming down especially with new opportunities related to new geographic markets new segments you are about to launch things like sports bet and things like that is that still reasonable to think that your cost of acquisition wont go down david baazov yes we believe that it will the predominant factor here is as a clearly stated on the call our goal is to double the size of poker in the next five years that happens through three primary ways obviously geographic expansion has been a massive growth driver for the expansion of poker historically and we still believe that there is a lot of growth there and product innovation is going to be another one but currently pokerstars enjoys the lowest cost of layer acquisition in the industry already steve li perfect maybe can you discuss quickly the challenges to release a new product like for the sports bet towards q what are your expectations down the road in three to five years do you think that the market be  how significant can it be david baazov so the launch of sports betting has actually occurred today the expectation is that it will be fully rolled out to all the available players in q we take the same measured approach that we have historically we are not in a rush if we are going to do it we want to do it right id say that sports betting as a vertical – not could be will be very significant of a vertical for amaya it will probably become the secondlargest vertical eclipsing casino over time steve li maybe a little followup question is there any roi for you guys when you guys find out sports delivery is there a metric that you guys look for in terms of number of increasing number of leads or is it just increasing your brand presence david baazov i didnt understand part of your question increasing – you said leads steve li when you guys find up deliveries is there key metrics that you guys look for initially in those geographic markets in terms of increasing new customer base or is just serving ph the brand and making sure increasing the awareness of your platform david baazov we measure on roi on every single marketing campaign that we do so in terms of brand awareness our brand awareness of pokerstars is already in excess of  on a global basis on international awareness so the purpose here is we measure every single marketing campaign in roi you are launching two new verticals at a time when people are actually in most cases spending less in marketing so we are taking advantage of that and have allowed to have an increased marketing spend on that basis how do we measure what we are looking for is im not just looking at the predictable portion which well be crossselling which will be because we have this massive customer player pool that will immediately start to play on our verticals the day we offer it to not have wallet management they wont need to manage a wallet off two different sites or three different sites and they can now amalgamate it on one site what we are actually looking for is the most independent customer acquisition in those channels specifically based on having a better product offering than our peers steve li thanks a lot for taking my questions operator and this concludes todays qa session ill now turn the call back over for closing remarks david baazov id like to thank everyone for participating on todays call we certainly

in quebec march th  by philip conneller canadian financial regulator amf is pursuing amaya ceo david baazov’s elder brother ofer “josh” baazov for alleged securities fraud it announced yesterday josh baazov second from right and craig levett second from left representing amaya to casino officials in the dominican republic in  they are both now named as suspects in an ongoing security fraud investigation by the quebec regulator image listindiariocom the elder baazov has an apparently shady history having once served  days in prison for possession of cocaine as well as operating a telemarketing scam that conned gullible customers out of hundreds and thousands of dollars just hours after the shocking news that amaya’s ceo was facing five counts of insider trading a second official amf statement announced that it had executed search warrants and obtained freezeandceasetrade orders against of a separate group of  individuals including josh baazov those orders mean the thirteen cannot initiate or complete any trades on the toronto stock exchange while the orders remain in place and also gives the amf the power to freeze bank accounts and seize any tangible assets the amf alleges that the  suspects “traded while in possession of privileged information or they leaked privileged information about potential mergers and acquisitions involving amaya inc” the quebec regulator also alleges that they enriched themselves by around ca million  million between  and  the dates are significant in that they imply that the alleged insider trading predates the rational group acquisition  was the year that amaya announced its first major takeover of software company chartwell and later canadian online gaming pioneer cryptologic telemarketing scam in the midnineties josh baazov fell afoul of the washingtonbased federal trade commission’s “project jackpot” which was charged with targeting telemarketing scams offering phony prizes according to canada’s globe and mail the ftc accused josh baazov’s company of tricking us senior citizens into buying hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise in return for the promise of valuable prizes none of which ever

on his response to allegations against him by quebec’s stock market regulator and to prepare an offer to buy amayabaazov faces five charges including influencing or attempting to influence the market price of the securities of amaya and communicating privileged information he has denied the accusations and said he is confident he will be found innocent of the charges“as always i continue to be dedicated to doing the right thing for amaya and all its stakeholders” baazov said in a statement tuesday“i believe that stepping down in the short term will help to avoid distraction for the company and its management while i vigorously contest all allegations made against me and pursue my bid to acquire the company”article continued belowbaazov was charged last week along with two other people and three companies following an investigation by the autorite des marches financiers amf into alleged insider tradingthe amf also announced last wednesday that it executed search warrants and

financial officer our fourth quarter performance demonstrated that the business is operationally strong and our brands are delivering on a sound strategy for growing the business through multiple gaming verticals particularly through the strength of our emerging realmoney online casino offerings and maintaining a market leading high quality consumer experience in our core online poker business the fourth quarter capped a year in which the business faced multiple challenges some expected and others not it showed very strong resilience highlighting the underlying quality of our fundamentals we generated strong and recurring cash flow have a dominant market share in poker are showing strong momentum in key new growth businesses particularly real money online casino games and are leveraging our proven ability to bring in new customers while engaging our broad customer base now over  million with compelling promotions new games and strong marketing campaigns for example our fourth quarter revenues increased  and adjusted ebitda increased  we maintained pokerstars dominant position in the global online poker market the estimated  share of realmoney poker for a liquidity we attracted new players through several key promotions and marketing campaigns including those starring global soccer stars cristiano ronaldo and neymar junior and well continue to leverage these global celebrities in  we also introduced a number of initiatives designed to make poker more fun for new and existing recreational players including through the introduction of new innovative products revamping the vip loyalty system and limiting third party software tools during the fourth quarter real money online casino continued to grow as a proportion of our overall revenues and we believe there is more opportunity for continued growth as we begin customer acquisition marketing and let to expand the base of players to whom real money online casino is available casino had over  quarterly active unique playing in our casino games in the fourth quarter and we believe our online casino is among the worlds fastest growing with one of the largest player bases among our competitors we introduced our sportsbook offering during  and launched the betstars brand in  while certain development constraints resulted in rolling out the offerings slower than originally anticipated in q  we had approximately  quarterly active uniques in  we began launching marketing initiatives primarily in the uk and plan to introduce betstars to more geographies in the european including france and italy and to increase the number of sports available for betting on the regulatory front we obtained new gaming licenses or approvals to operate in several jurisdictions including new jersey and increased the sustainability of our revenue base we also started paying gaming duties or related vat in five additional er jurisdictions bringing our total to  we became a pure play buc operator by completing the divestiture of our bb business for solid returns in  we reduced our total debt by approximately us million and reduced our weighted average cost of debt to  were pleased with these results and the performance of the business notwithstanding significant headwinds that impacted revenue and profitability such as the levy of certain v gaming duties the suspension or impairment of real money operations in certain jurisdictions and currency fluctuations despite the challenges our  performance showed growth and momentum in many of our kpis the fourth quarter of  customer registrations increased by two million to approximately  million as if to date the aggregate customer registrations exceeded  million our overall quarterly active uniques were over  million a decline of approximately  over q  with growth on pokerstars of approximately  primarily offset by a decline in full tilt however excluding the effect of suspected or impaired jurisdictions active uniques on pokerstars increased by approximately  and overall uniques by approximately  our quarterly net yield which represents our real money gaming revenue per quarterly active unique increased  yearoveryear to  million due to foreign exchange fluctuations however on a us dollar basis the total was  a decrease of  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis which excludes the impact of yearoveryear changes in foreign exchange rates total quarterly net yield was us representing an increase of  yearoveryear the growth in quarterly net yield on a constant currently basis was primarily attributable to the rollout of the pokerstars real money online casino product danny will now walk you through our  fourth quarter and annual financial performance and additional detail daniel sebag thanks david before we begin please note that the  figures assumes that the acquisitions of our bc business occurred as of january   and the disposition of our bb businesses occurred as of december   as lf the fourth quarter our business had two new reporting segments real money online poker and combined real money online casino and sportsbook as it relates to these two segments online revenues include revenues generated through our online mobile and desktop playing platforms the remaining revenue is included in other and corporate revenue in addition as youre aware this past november we revised our full year  guidance weve provided a slide with a reconciliation showing that we either met or beat our revised guidance for each measure for those measures that we beat guidance it was primarily the result of a revaluation of our frequent player points following the implementation of the previously announced changes to our vip structure which positively impacted revenue by approximately  million in  the increase in the us dollar to the canadian dollar exchange rate had a favorable impact on our reported revenues our q  revenues increased approximately  to approximately  million versus q  revenues we have growth in casino and sportsbook revenue which offset a decline in poker revenue poker revenues comprised approximately  of total revenues and casino and sportsbook combined revenues comprised  as compared to approximately  and  respectively in q  our poker revenues declined  in q  primarily as a result of the levy of certain valueadded taxes the previously reported suspension or impairment of certain jurisdictions a decline in the activity on the full tilt platform and cannibalization from our real money online casino product our casino and sportsbook revenues increased significantly in q  primarily as a result of the expansion of casino under the pokerstars brand and the addition of third party slots our full year  revenues increased  to  billion from full year   of revenue came from poker and  from casino and sportsbook on a geographic basis  revenues were split approximately as follows  from  countries in the european union  from the rest of europe  from the americas and  from the rest of the world while our operating business generates deposits from players around the world most notably in europe the game play is predominantly in us dollars therefore our business is impacted by fluctuations in global currencies against the us dollar in  the purchasing power of our customer base declined significantly we estimate the value of our customers local currencies decline by  due to the impact of currency fluctuations on our business we provide a constant currency comparison to show how the underlying business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a constant currency basis excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations our q  total revenue increased  versus q  and our total revenue for  increased  versus  our q  real money online poker revenue decreased  versus q  while our full year  poker revenue increased approximately  versus  on a constant currency basis we estimate the impact of vat and certain suspended or impaired jurisdictions was  on total revenue and  on poker revenue for the quarter and full year our adjusted ebitda increased approximately  in q  over q  which is in line with our revenue growth adjusted ebitda during the quarter included approximately  million of adjustments notably  million of pre austrian gaming duty a significantly majority of which was incurred prior to our acquisition of rational group and is included in the endemic claim we filed with the sellers we have also filed the claim in austria challenged the constitutionality of the levying  million related to the termination of certain affiliate and employment agreements and  million of impairment charges adjusted ebitda in  benefited from the expansion of online casino but was negatively impacted by vat as well as new gaming duties in multiple jurisdictions casino provided strong ebitda margins as we did not engage in external marketing focusing simply on cross sell profits from the vertical will help support our investment in both sportsbook and our new jersey launch primarily through advertising and nonrd headcount as we have previously noted we intent to begin external customer acquisition efforts including through a standalone mobile casino app our adjusted net earnings grew  to  million in q  versus q  reflecting the increase in adjusted ebitda and the reduction of interest expense adjusted net earnings per diluted share was  in q  versus  in q  for the full year  adjusted net earnings per diluted share was  versus  in  in q  we generated approximately  million in operating cash flow from continuing operations versus  million in q  with the increase largely due to movements in the us dollar to the canadian dollar exchange rate in the first two months of  we estimate that we have generated approximately us million of revenue representing a  increase over the prior period in  of the total revenue real money online poker revenue was us million representing a  decrease over the prior year period and real money online casino and sportsbook revenue was us million representing a significant increase over the prior year period on a constant currency basis for the first two months of  total revenue increased  while poker revenue decreased  the decline in poker is primarily a result of customers playing through a smaller deposit base in q  versus q  when they had not just experienced the impact of the devaluation of their local currencies against the us dollar poker revenue was also impacted by cannibalization from new verticals primarily casino including more the decline is being mitigated by improved net deposits which are up yearoveryear we have seen other early positive results in the vip program change including player deposits lasting longer as previously announced the special committee of the board of directors determined in consultation with the audit committee that in view of the potential offer to acquire amaya that maybe forthcoming from mr baazov and the fact that the special committees financial advisor and the independent valuator commence the review process it would be inappropriate for amaya to provide guidance with respect to its  financial performance at this time an analysis of managements forecast with amayas financial performance will be part of the valuators work and its report which would include certain forecast information would be made public as part of any disclosure document relating to any offer with that said note that amaya is not otherwise precluded from providing  financial guidance in the future i will now turn the call over to david david baazov thank you danny although challenges remain were confident that the company can deliver in  as it relates to our core poker offerings pokerstar is finalizing testing of its gaming platform with the new jersey division of gaming enforcement and expect to launch real money online poker and casino to customers in new jersey beginning next week this is an eagerly awaited milestone for the company and by new jersey customers while new jersey remains a small segregated market we consider it a significant milestone for pokerstars and for online gaming in the united states and it delivers and one of the promises made by us when we acquire the brand in august of  through targeted investments in marketing and customer acquisition initiatives primarily during peak seasons beginning in  we intent for pokerstars to become one of the leading online gaming sites in the new jersey regulated market in addition as danny just noted were encouraged by the early results that have previously announced changes to our poker offering net deposits are up yearoveryear and our new players deposits are lasting longer pokerstars plans to continue to make other changes to the site to enhance the experience of new and recreational players including among other initiatives efforts to prevent data mining and player targeting and continuing to develop new products and features that attract and retain customers as we have previously noted we plan to reinvest any savings from the changes to our vip royalty program in an effort to attract engage and retain customers such as through marketing campaigns rd and continued efforts to promote online gaming in new and emerging jurisdictions as it relates to our emerging online casino offerings were very pleased with the continued progress with the pokerstars casino vertical which has shown very strong growth in  this growth continue to come strictly from organic traffic and cross sell even with many of the best known and in demand games already this year the pokerstars casino has added a number of new games and will continue to integrate with many of the leading license game suppliers in the industry betstars our new sport betting brand is in investment mode and as we add new sports and launch new and innovative offerings including spinning bet which we believe is an attractive innovation that will spark the interest and excitement of new and existing customers in the first two months of  we estimate that casino and betstars combined represented  of revenues demonstrating the initial popularity of these offerings without fully marketing them outside of our own customer base in addition to growth in our online gaming operations we continuously strive to maintain our position as an industry leader by efficiently and effectively deploying resources in our daytoday operations we believe that the recently announced plan to migrate the full tilt brand and players over the pokerstars platform will improve player liquidity increase the capacity of our development team and reduce duplicative cost and overall enhance the customer experience for  we expect to continue to drive consumer excitement and plan to focus on among other things continued and sustainable growth of our core product offerings closing existing product apps bringing innovative products to the markets providing the best possible player experience across all offerings and continuing to grow our customer base with quality marketing and promotions were confident that we have the management the people and the products to take advantage of market and vertical opportunities for many years to come and as the ceo of amaya i approach everyday fueled by my passion to continue to build amaya into the global leader in online gaming and aggressively pursue our growth strategies i continue to focus on fulfilling my duties to the company and its shareholders including with respect to the operations and further strategic development of the company now that i have settled a special committee the process for my bid including the framework for the company to share its confidential information externally im going to position to move towards submitting a proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of amaya consistent with my previously announce intensions before we open the line for questions please note that at the direction of the special committee of the board of directors i will not be addressing any questions relating to my potential offer to acquire the company operator we are now ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chad beynon from macquarie your line is open chad beynon hi guys good afternoon thanks for taking my questions how are you i wanted to start off with casino you mentioned that nonpoker for  quarter to date is  that’s impressive and the uniques that you gave in the fourth quarter in casino i think were also kind of ahead of expectations could you give us a little bit better sense of where you are with casino from a jurisdictional standpoint and then also kind of a mobile standpoint just some more kind of highlights on where we need to go before you really start marketing towards kind of a new audience how is left on on the bone here thanks david baazov so i would say that from an exposure perspective chad just over  as in the two previous qs however more games were added to mobile so platform availability of games is getting better we do have more jurisdictions to launch such as new jersey and the relaunch in portugal and some other smaller jurisdictions but as weve said casino will be available to  to  of our player base primarily in the eu there is also some growth coming from were adding it to our mac client continue to integrate more games on to mobile which is obviously a very important channel and weve just recently added progressive slots and i’d say intend to integrate many more games from tier  content providers that are going to be expanded through our geographic base and lastly i would say were planning to do external customer acquisition which will be attracting casino first players as well chad beynon any acquisition in the marketing that should commence in the second half of the year or has that started in the second quarter any help there david baazov i would say that digital marketing will likely start first and that could be as early as in the next few months and i would say that when it comes to television etcetera some of the productions that will probably be second half likely chad beynon okay thanks and then my followup just a broad question around poker legislation globally we’ve seen some articles during the past quarter with respect to russia brazil canada etcetera any updates you can provide there in terms of what youre seeing and what your expectations are from a jurisdictional standpoint thanks david baazov as it relates to russia the recent announcements are primarily related to sportsbook which we do not operate in russia nor do we operate casino and in terms of poker we remain optimistic at the chance for more movement on the regulation of online poker and our stance is the same for it to happen this year as it relates to some of the other markets ie brazil the senate is moving on a bill and we are optimistic there as well and are likely lobbing for it to move ahead i’d say that as relates to portugal were aiming for a q relaunch now subject to license approval and as it relates to i would say some of asia or india we’re trying to develop a strategy for penetration but there is nothing to update there at this time chad beynon okay great best of luck operator the next question comes from the line of eyal ofir from dundee capital markets your line is open eyal ofir thanks just excuse me of the background noise here i just want to follow up on your comments at the end of your commentary basically on the bid in terms of your ability now to submit your bid is that the rational there of taking this as long as you need to see the financial  audited financials come out or was there another reason for it david baazov i couldn’t share any information externally eyal and thats all i could really comment eyal ofir okay that’s fine and you can’t comment about timing either david baazov i could not no eyal ofir okay thanks now moving on to the fundamentals of the business can you just talk about in terms of what you’re seeing right now in the casino side you said you’re going to go into external marketing are you seeing some casinoonly players on your side already or is it primarily poker  primary poker players playing casino and same question  sorry… david baazov let’s say right now we’re seeing approximately  of our player base being casinoonly players eyal ofir okay and thats the total player base or is that  of the casino david baazov  of the q quarterly active uniques there eyal ofir okay perfect and then on the sports betting side obviously more bigger push into q and obviously throughout  in terms of marketing initiatives there and also what you’re seeing today can you just talk about the expectation of the ramp and also how should we think about new products coming out and as you progress throughout the year how should we expect that ramp to go david baazov in terms of exposure our sportsbook in terms of betstars is approximately is about  by the end of the year and we still have some larger jurisdictions to go which will get us closer to casino of our active players being in jurisdictions where sportsbook is available primarily in the eu and some of these include denmark italy france portugal and theyre subject to license approval and i would also add as it relates to betstars our active uniques making sports bet have been trending higher and as i said on the call sportsbook is in investment mode we have a good team now of about  excluding those working on development it’s a competitive market we’re making investments in marketing to get brand recognition it’s important in sportsbook  marketing is a lot about getting the brand awareness out there and we need to invest again recognition among betters and it won’t be as fast as casino as its a competitive market everywhere and brand is very important eyal ofir okay thanks there are more followups about casino i will come back operator and the next question comes from the line of ralph garcea from cantor fitzgerald your line is open ralph garcea good evening gentlemen maybe just a follow up on the first two months of this year number on casino and sportsbook can you give us between the two or i guess is the sportsbook revenue greater than  million david baazov i will tell you ralph ill tell you sportsbook was just a few million dollars ralph garcea okay and you have a full rollouts not full rollouts but in france and italy and some of the other eu countries before the euro championship this summer david baazov that is our plan ralph garcea and then on the sponsorship i guess later on would you look to sponsor premier league teams come the fall of  to accelerate some of that nondigital marketing seeing your other competitors have premier league sponsors david baazov we find to be i would say rather expensive and would measure the roi by a lot closer in terms of what we’re getting for it at this time ralph garcea i see and then just lastly before you said as the us market progresses over the next three to five years you saw poker hit double in size if everything were to roll out on a statebystate basis do you still think you can double that poker market in five years if the us unfolds as you think it should david baazov yes ralph when i made that comment it doesn’t just represent the us it also represented geographic expansion that i would say would include asia which we would like to see happen as well and i would say that if you had asian expansion as well as us expansion yes i do believe that that could happen ralph garcea and then just lastly on mobile i noted you just started rolling it out on the casino side can you give a percentage of the casino revenue and the sportsbook that was for mobile david baazov yes i will say that so above  of pokerstars real money uniques and mobile and social channels are continuing to grow as a percentage of registration i would say that if the question is specific in terms of percentage or breakdown is that the question ralph garcea yeah on the mobile side david baazov yes so about  of casino revenue is mobile and about  of poker revenue is our mobile and i would say that sports is representing approximately slightly below  ralph garcea yes and i guess it might be dependent on your bid but if you had a chance to accelerate your market share grab on the sportsbook side would you consider doing an acquisition through  or do you think you have the product with a full rollout and  penetration or exposure to that base to get a meaningful market share on the sportsbook side david baazov yes ralph i would say in independent of any bid we always look at ma opportunities i would say opportunistically and that wouldn’t change but i think the company is focused on organic growth ralph garcea okay thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of maher yaghi from desjardins capital markets your line is open maher yaghi yes thank you for taking my question just wanted to ask you on the poker revenues in the quarter the decline of  yearonyear what would that be in constant currency david baazov for which period are we talking about for q maher yaghi q yes q david baazov yes so in the presentation i pointed to the slide i believe it’s slide  on a constant currency basis you would see that the decrease is  maher yaghi  in constant currency so basically no big difference between the constant currency numbers that you reported the results in canadian dollars and in constant currency that you have in poker david baazov correct because the canadian dollar gained strength through the quarter the canadian dollar weakened in q maher yaghi but it seems only slightly because in terms of reported results in canadian dollars you had a decline of  yearonyear in canadian dollars and you’re telling me in constant currency it declined by  so practically no difference david baazov yes exactly for the quarter specifically the canadian dollar moved in a manner similar to the back of the currencies for q and thats why you won’t see a difference daniel sebag i think the other difference is just clear on a constant currency excluding vat and excluded jurisdictions you would see it flat on a yearoveryear basis maher yaghi okay great now i turn my attention a little bit on your adjustments during the quarter you stated a few of them but i’m trying to just understand what are the other nonrecurrent cost the  million that you adjusted for in q daniel sebag so in it the largest item is austria gaming duty which relates to gaming duty of prior periods during the year that was about  million of austrian gaming duty that related to  gaming duty so that was adjusted out another large component to that amount is we have lobbying cost of about  million which are nonus lobbying for various jurisdictions which i believe nonrecurring by the company we also have a retention bonus that was inherited when we acquired the company that was in many options that were paid out to the legacy employees pokerstars over a period of time and that was about  million and that accounts for the vast majority of the  million maher yaghi great great and impairment the  million impairment charge what is that for david baazov the  million impairment charge the biggest aspect of the impairment charge has to do with the nova assets so we have an investment in an associate that was impaired during the period  during the year maher yaghi okay thank you and okay so i just had a question also it’s not related to david’s intentions but maybe i think you guys can answer this question but in your first lien credit agreement under article  section  for eventually space that change of control with count as default event and the definition of change of control it says any changes that other than permitted holders would own more than  of the voting power of the ordinary voting stock entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors can you clarify what this exact theory means does it include all options warrants outstanding converts etcetera and can you may be just clarify this clause david baazov you are referencing the right provision but unfortunately we cannot get into it at this time maher yaghi just for general understanding of the provision this is a document that was filed by the company and not pertaining to any forthcoming bid or anything just trying to understand what this split means exactly david baazov were you asking about the structure maher yaghi well exactly what counts into the  david baazov i couldn’t answer that because youre asking what is the structure essentially of the bet group and i can comment on that maher yaghi okay and in terms of the  as an ongoing business can you talk a little bit about what is your expected  debt repayment amount david baazov yes the principle would be about  principle amortization would be approximately  million usd so that’s the principle amortization and in q  at march  well have to pay   to  of the excess cash flow sweep depending on leverage ratios maher yaghi okay now in terms of finally just one last question in terms of the full tilt combination that you guys are planning to have what is your expectation about the impact of that change on liquidity i guess the liquidity it would be a positive for both type of players but in terms of any kind of revenues that was generated by the same players on both accounts that now you could have some limitation on potentially getting if youre combining both accounts together is there any risk in losing some revenues when you combine these assets david baazov i would say that there is definitely a possibility i would say that the brand is going to maintain a lot of look and feel of the existing offering and some of the current features but i think that the benefits of the added liquidity far outweigh that as well as from a corporate perspective increasing the capacity of rd team in terms of developers will far outweigh that maher yaghi can you talk about the cost synergies that you can get from these from this combination how should we model a little bit your operating expenses given this change david baazov so we couldn’t comment i’d say that at this time in terms of quantifying it exactly but what i could say is there is a number of duplicative costs and there will be some savings maher yaghi is that material or not so much david baazov i wouldn’t say its material maher yaghi okay great thank you very much operator and there are no further audio questions at this time i will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks david baazov id like to thank everyone for participating on todays call we certainly appreciate your questions and
