facebook press releases spruce point capital releases a dimming and grim outlook a strong sell research opinion on gentex corporation nasdaq gntx jul   am edt new york july   prnewswire  spruce point conducted an extensive fundamental and forensic accounting review encompassing several freedom of information requests foias a product teardown reverse engineering test and conversations with former employees we believe that gentex corp nasdaq gntx faces  downside risk as a result of potential financial misstatement and a litany of fundamental challenges our forensic review raised multiple red flags pertaining to gentexs financial statements weve uncovered multiple instances where the company has made contradictory statements across government entities public financial statements and internal communications  additionally through foias and forensic accounting analysis we have strong conviction that aggressive capex and inventory inflation may be used to inflate margins to forestall underlying weakness  these red flags are cause for heightened concern given conversations that weve held with individuals previously involved with the company and the extremely poor governance financial controls and audit oversight currently in place   once interested third parties sec michigan environmental agency gentex creditors etc evaluate our claims there is potential for gentex to be in violation of its credit agreement in addition to concerns about gentexs financials we believe that investors will also have to look beyond myriad fundamental challenges on the horizon contribution and profitability from key modules are in decline our field research indicates that smartbeam  of sales is already in decline as cost of traditional driver assist packages continue to come down in price and oems look to avoid redundancies homelink now faces competition for the first time from a comparable magna product and various phone apps with additional functionality we are likely in the early innings of a meaningful saar decline and decontenting cycle the past cycle of surging auto sales high levels of affordability and the gradual digitalization of the auto user experience ux presented the ideal backdrop for gentex we believe the current dynamics of the used car market have set the stage for a dramatic reversal in auto sales and affordability we believe that reduced affordability will lead to decontenting magnifying the challenge of the downturn for gentex the full display mirror fdm is a problem not the answer gentexs moat historically has been the autodimming feature of its mirrors the fact that the fdm functions primarily as a display rather than a mirror makes the auto dimming feature almost irrelevant this exposes gentex to a much wider range of competitors including display suppliers attempting to make mirrors and traditional mirror companies that have strategically partnered with display companies we believe that ficosa panasonic is offering their own version of the fdm at a  haircut to the gentex fdm price gentexs inability to rely on an auto dimming premium and reliance on kyocera as a display supplier will limit margin and their ability to compete on price the longterm viability of the mirror is difficult to envision the convergence of the connected car and assisted driving are rapidly reshaping the technology ux experience of the automobile particularly vehicle navigation we believe that the future of vehicle navigation is cameras sensors and displays not mirrors over the past several years multiple world class technology companies eg samsung panasonic intel google have entered the space via strategic investment and acquisition of existing automobile navigation suppliers all of these players are focusing their efforts on the ux and to date almost all of them are focused on heads up display hud or the center console gentex appears to be on an island having not forged any strategic partnerships of meaning to date and linking their future to the likely illtimed nearterm solution of the fdm wall street analysts see just  upside in gentex a terrible riskreward  analysts assume that its margins are industry leading and fairly presented its competitive position is defensible management is trustworthy and honest and its valuation should reflect a premium to auto supply peers analysts expect gentex to achieve nearly  revenue and  earnings growth this year despite creeping signs of peak auto sales we believe this market consensus view is entirely flawed and does not incorporate our incontrovertible evidence of irregularities and product teardown results illustrating limited proprietary content we estimate gentexs gross margins are likely closer to  vs  reported and its revenue growth expectations will disappoint on a discounted x x multiple to account for the pending auto cycle correction and extreme potential for financial malfeasance we see approximately  –  per share or  –  nearterm downside risk longerterm industry displacement of mirrors could render gentex worthless if you dont believe us we suggest reading bofamls june report which places an  price target on gentex in our view the solid growth that gentex once enjoyed is likely to be challenged by increasing competition and potential substitute products at the very least the existence of a potential replacement product will likely drive meaningful pricing pressure for gentex the research report can be found at wwwsprucepointcapcom and updates will be posted on twitter sprucepointcap spruce point

mirrors for the auto and airline industry its products are commoditized and require nothing more than plastic moldings mirrors chemicals printed circuit boards and other inputs such as compasses its financials suggest it to be a wildly profitable company yet our forensic analysis uncovers numerous red flags to suggest otherwise gentex’s ipo in the early s is littered with red flags its dimmable mirror was a carrot to bail out its struggling smoke detector business and its management put no capital at risk gentex’s success has defied all the odds it now commands a bn market cap and claims  market share its lead ipo underwriter and banker otc net founded by juan carlos schidlowski was a notorious penny stock promoter who was later charged by the sec and fled the country gentex’s  gross margins are vastly superior to all global auto suppliers and are likely overstated by x we believe it’s aggressively leaving costs in inventory inventory growth is x revenue growth while inflating capex through nonsensical projects eg its north riley campus is  over initial budget we commissioned a product tear down by ihs an automotive expert to examine its components in our view gentex’s rhetoric pertaining to its mirror’s level of proprietary components and vertical integration is likely exaggerated we also have documented proof of capex misstatement despite margins and profitably that dwarfs auto supply peers gentex policies that are touted as shareholder friendly are not what they appear its dividend growth has been well below the rate of its reported free cash flow growth which is likely overstated and its share repurchases are mostly to offset dilution gentex has amassed an abnormal amount of cash on its balance sheet and has irregular level i and ii classifications we believe gentex has shunned ma to avoid outside scrutiny the only acquisition of note in its history was of homelink a relatedparty deal where we find issues download the report to read more read

and earnings growth following years of disappointment and ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing earnings spruce point believes the financial improvement reflects temporary factors and may not be sustainable we expect new competition to storm the market and challenge irobot’s us market share dominance irobot’s recent financial performance reflects restocking of its supply chain after years of false starts the removal of the struggling military business and the acquisition boost from its japanese distributor we believe these factors will create very difficult comparisons for irobot to lap in the future and create headwinds for future share price appreciation furthermore we believe recent gains are a result of lowering the price of its roomba to move down market which we believe is a longterm negative on margins for a technology hardware company with a narrow product focus investors are overlooking financial control issues tied to irobot’s recent acquisition of its japanese distributor the company suspiciously retracted certain statements made about japanese sales growth reversing big gains to declines and made revenue and earnings revisions which don’t add up spruce point has previously pointed out early warning signs at sabre and caesarstone both which made relatedparty distributor acquisitions ahead of extreme financial revisions market observers will note that

“emerging growth company” under section  of sarbanes oxley it will face stricter financial control wix insiders have incentives to heavily promote its shares and left clues to suggest it intends to

“unbilled deferred revenue” – read the fine print they have no correlation to future revenues we even spoke with ptc’s former evp of sales to ask his opinion what these metrics mean and he couldn’t
