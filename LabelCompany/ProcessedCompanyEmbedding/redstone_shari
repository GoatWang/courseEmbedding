product fanrag sports nfl mcmullen  shari redstone warns nfl about fragmented product by john mcmullen posted on jun   rich graessleicon sportswire ratings are down in almost every aspect of television with the notable exception of cable news that is what’s known as an anomaly however and everything from scripted shows all the way down to the bulletproof nfl has suffered an erosion of viewers due to a confluence of factors with technology and a new generation of viewers who consume media in different fashion leading the way the league experienced a dip of  percent in its national television windows last season slightly better than the four major networks cbs abc nbc fox which combined to post doubledigit declines in prime time by february the nfl isn’t terribly concerned because its  ratings look much better if you take out the windows where the league was competing with the presidential debates which delivered massive numbers in a polarized country and to a certain extent that’s true as the dip would have been nominal without that competition which obviously will not be there come september  that means roger goodell and co are expecting a market correction this time around and a return to its standing as one of the only dvrproof options left for its partners cbs ceo les moonves however warned the league about overexposure hurting ratings as well and his boss the network’s vice chairwoman shari redstone also spun that narrative last week while speaking at recode’s annual code conference “it got very confusing for the consumer” redstone said wednesday “… i think they were on too many networks they started to commoditize the experience and not really keep it as something that was really special on sundays on thursdays you didn’t know what network it was found on” oldschool television executives believe in destination viewing and it is tough to create that when a package is being promoted on three different platforms last year thursday night football was seen on nbc cbs nfl network and occasionally streamed on twitter redstone a new england patriots fan claimed tnf was only a mustwatch if her team was on the docket “if i see something channel surfing on my way to the football game i may not watch the game” redstone claimed “it got to be too much too many stations too many networks” the status quo remains for now however with the exception of amazon filling in as the streaming option as the nfl tries to gain a foothold with cordcutting millennials a difficult task to date as evidenced by the pingponging from yahoo to twitter and now amazon over a threeyear period despite the criticism redstone isn’t ready to say writing a check for  million for its piece of the thursday programming was a mistake “people want exclusive content” she explained “i have full confidence in the nfl they are a great organization and we love our football” the reality is that redstone wasn’t about to drop any bombs because the deal between the nfl and cbs for “thursday night football” has one year left on its run but this could be a foreshadowing that the same kind of check won’t be there for the nfl in the future unless changes are made john

redstone gene maddaus senior media writer genemaddaus share this article linkedin email print talk john salangsangbfacomrexshutterstock may    am pt moments after a judge threw out her lawsuit seeking to take control of sumner redstone’s health care manuela herzer filed a new lawsuit monday alleging she has been deprived of  million in expected inheritance herzer redstone’s longtime companion alleges that redstone’s daughter shari conspired with seven nurses to force herzer out of redstone’s life and remove her from his estate plan “what happened to sumner redstone was not the product of free will” herzer’s attorney pierce o’donnell said outside court”it was the product of an orchestrated devious campaign to take over her father and his estate and to throw the love of his life manuela herzer out of his house” shari redstone’s spokesperson responded “promptly after her significant loss in court today‎ herzer continued her baseless attack against the redstone family with a second lawsuit it is total fiction and continues to speak volumes about herzer’s motivation and character” the new lawsuit by herzer appeared to fly in the face of claims by o’donnell at the outset of the dispute the lawyer said the exgirlfriend was interested solely in protecting redstone and overseeing his care o’donnell denied that his client was pursuing her case for financial reasons — noting that she had already received millions from the magnate when the two were still close and therefore did not need to pursue any of his fortune after he was gone according to the new lawsuit herzer was in line to receive half of a personal trust valued at  million the other half was set to go to redstone’s girlfriend sydney holland redstone also gave herzer and holland gifts of  million apiece the taxes on those gifts were to be paid by national amusement trust of which shari was a  percent shareholder the suit claims that shari was intent on removing her father’s companions from his estate plan in august  holland admitted to being unfaithful to redstone and he ended the relationship in september he changed his estate plan to remove holland the new plan gave herzer  million plus redstone’s beverly park home valued at  million the suit claims that shari then set about to remove the only other obstacle between herself and her father “the only way that shari could get rid of herzer was to alienate her father’s affection for and trust in her” the suit claims in order to do that the suit alleges that shari relied on redstone’s nurses to feed her information in october the nurses conducted an “intervention” with redstone in which they allegedly persuaded him that he had intended only to leave  million to herzer not  million according to the suit they also told redstone that herzer had lied to him when she repeatedly said that his sex therapist was unavailable to see him soon after herzer was thrown out of the house redstone changed his estate plan again to write herzer out as well the suit says that shari and her children proceeded to “brainwash” redstone about herzer’s misconduct redstone’s legal team has indicated it plans to file suit against herzer to recover  million that she was given outside court o’donnell said such a suit would be little more than a smokescreen “if they want to sue manuela bring it on” he said filed under manuela herzerpierce

whether the companies are reunited or sold off in pieces viacom’s stock has tumbled amid the uncertainties about the company’s future and the lackluster performance of its signature business units“it is such a sad tortured situation” said jeffrey sonnenfeld senior associate dean for leadership programs at the yale school of management “she is locked in this frustrating paralysis” shari redstone and her father have famously clashed over the years disputes have often centered on who would lead the companies after he was no longer able to do so during a family squabble sumner redstone in  offered to buy his daughter out of the family business then in late  he offered her  billion to surrender her stake in national amusements according to people familiar with the proposal she declinedshari redstone declined to be interviewed for this story but in recent court documents she acknowledged the friction within her family“my father and i have a uniquely close relationship both as fatherdaughter and professionally” redstone said in a court filing “in the past we have had very public disagreements over business matters we have patched those up and family has always been the most important thing to me”shari redstone grew up in newton mass and once worked as a summer intern at paramount pictures she graduated from tufts university and earned her law degree from boston

helping launch the trend toward luxury cinemas since  she has served as president of the family’s holding company which includes the theater chain national amusements that boasts more than  screens in

bridge an upscale theater in west la off the  freeway which has since been sold to cinemark she also pushed to expand national amusements into russia where she and heth owned and ran a chain of six theaters before selling them in redstone subsequently launched a small venture capital firm advancit capital with her soninlaw jason ostheimer it invests in startups in the technology and media spaceover the years she has repeatedly sparred with her strongwilled father often about corporate succession in one notable flareup in  sumner redstone publicly disparaged his daughter“while my daughter talks of good governance” sumner redstone wrote in a letter published by forbes “she apparently ignores the cardinal rule of good governance that the boards of the two public companies viacom and cbs should select my successor… it must be remembered that i gave to my children their stock and it is i with little or no contribution on their part who built these great media companies”for months father and daughter communicated by faxrelations thawed in the fall of  when the redstones came precariously close to losing their empire amid the financial crisis banks called in  billion in loans the redstones had used to make investments including for theater expansion shari redstone worked alongside the family’s attorneys to restructure the debt and preserve their holdingsbut shari redstone was once again sidelined in recent years as her father’s much younger girlfriend sydney holland and another companion manuela herzer played central roles in the mogul’s life — until last fallherzer  in november filed a lawsuit that alleged that sumner redstone is no longer mentally competent the petition came about six weeks after sumner redstone cut herzer out of his will until then herzer was in line to receive  million from redstone as well as his beverly park mansion worth  million according to a court document filed last weekshari redstone has contended that the women drove a wedge between her and her father she also noted in a court declaration filed this month that herzer had already received  million in gifts from sumner redstone since “once ms herzer was out of my father’s life my family and i were able to reunite with my father” shari redstone said in a declaration filed this monthan attorney for herzer pierce o’donnell has disputed shari redstone’s claims and said herzer’s privacy had been invaded “while shari was an absentee daughter manuela was at sumner’s side assuring that he had the very best health care” o’donnell said in a statement shari redstone in her declaration said she has visited her father  times since late octoberanother dispute became public this month when sumner redstone led the viacom board’s  vote in support of dauman as chairman that came after shari redstone took herself out of the running and said the chairman should be someone who is independent and not “intertwined in redstone family matters”her hands might be tied at the moment“there is not much that she can do now unless she can get her father to change his mind” said louis a mezzullo a san diego county attorney who deals with business succession and estate planning “as long as sumner redstone controls the  then what he says goes and dauman will be in charge at viacom — at least until her father is declared incompetent or dies”when that occurs the sumner m redstone trust goes into effect the trust will oversee sumner redstone’s  stake in national amusements inc which controls viacom and cbsthe mogul established the trust and named his five grandchildren as beneficiaries shari redstone is one of seven trustees along with one of her sons tyler korff who has a law degree and is a rabbi dauman also is a trustee“my singular objective is to protect and build value for all of viacoms shareholders and in doing so for all the beneficiaries of sumners trust who not only include the descendants of his daughter — but also those of her brother” dauman said during a call last week with wall street analysts shari redstone’s brother brent redstone also has had conflicts with her and sumner redstone a decade ago brent redstone filed a lawsuit looking to break up national amusements to settle the suit sumner and shari redstone bought out his stake in the company for about  millionall of this probably sets the stage for a protracted battle over what happens to viacom and cbs“there is nothing that makes family members hate each other more than fights over money or control” mezzullo said “it will be interesting to see how this all plays out it looks like a prescription for a lot of contention family tensions and lawsuits”megjameslatimescomfollow me on twitter megjameslatalsorepublican debate ratings are growing again with  million viewers

too much nfl on tv cbs executive shari redstone thinks so “it got very confusing for the consumer with the nfl last year i think they were on too many networks cbsnflby ian casselberry on  too much football such a thing might not seem possible to diehard nfl fans but watching pro football is no longer a diversion for an entire sunday with monday nights mixed in and following news through the rest of the week the nfl is on thursdays it’s on saturdays after college football season ends and with games played in london early sunday mornings are also filled with nfl action it’s become pervasive and if the nfl is on all the time does a game stand out as a special event shari redstone controlling shareholder of cbs and viacom believes too much nfl is on tv right now and that makes it easier to pass over unless your favorite team redstone is a new england patriots fan is playing appearing at recode’s annual code conference earlier this week redstone said too much product on so many different channels confuses football fans the latest the fighter and the kid’s brendan schaub talks mayweathermcgregor press tour and more nolan arenado hit three home runs in a game rockies fans were unable to watch on tv analyst suggests wwe could move live programming to facebook superstition in the booth baseball broadcasters weigh in on how to call a nohitter via recode “it got very confusing for the consumer with the nfl last year” redstone said wednesday at recode’s annual code conference “i think they were on too many networks they started to commoditize the experience and not really keep it as something that was really special on sundays on thursdays you didn’t know what network it was found on” there is a fine line between giving the people what they want and oversaturating the market a balance entertainment providers with which entertainment providers frequently struggle a network show like american idol or who wants to be a millionaire becomes a big hit and networks get greedy by putting it on multiple days per week rather than once or twice movie studios crank out sequels quickly after initial hits arguably that’s now happening with the nfl one key difference however is that networks are fiercely competing for rights to nfl game broadcasts streaming outlets like twitter and amazon have now joined the battle live games are content that won’t be left on dvrs to watch later very very few are going to stream a nfl game days or weeks after it was played the nfl is serving market demand rather than overestimating its appeal so if all these companies and conglomerates want pro football is the nfl supposed to say no and exercise some restraint not to mention turning away the hundreds of millions of dollars that networks are putting on the table redstone’s stance doesn’t mean that cbs won’t dial back its interest in the nfl of course pro football is big business and draws huge ratings for the network which paid big money to add the thursday night football package to its regular sunday afternoon and evening coverage “people want exclusive content” redstone told recode’s peter kafka “i have full confidence in the nfl they are a great

mckelvey cut it out…get you meds therealdan mckelvey hope you get your meds in time… carterburger nfl is killling the goose that lays the golden eggs boring bland politically correct product and on as many channels as possibles i’d correct shari on one point it’s not confusing us we just ain’t watching as much anymore bud college football is for nfl wanna be’s the big league is too tough for a lot of college boys back to shari redstone maybe you need to give more credit to fans then you arewe like our games even when it is a team we don’t care forwe can route for them to get beat by the other team… tmcb couldn’t agree more if it wasn’t for fantasy football i would watch a lot less there is absolutely nothing special at all about playing on thursday sunday or monday night zero i watch my team religously and it’s background video for all the rest why should i pay attention to any game other than my team cause there will be another game on momentarily… you can thank roger goodell for this too cause every single thing he does is to create more money for the owners teams players fans be damned ms fit kitty a true football fan would wanna watch all games whats the point on just watching your team and not see how your next opponent does… idk maybe i’m just a big fan… shawn diiorio if the nfl was on network tv  days a week in prime time it would win the ratings every single night it would beat out any other show or event period i suggest if the executives want something else capable of drawing similar ratings they come up with tv programming that is not hot garbage

change the channel lmbogo on and tune in to “reality” tv if thats what you’re intolol larry leyba excellent point joshua i must be in the minority i like the nfl on as many days and channels as possible never a rerun fair weather fans stick to your red zone channel and your inability to sit through bad football these are the same whiners who bore you with stories of what they binge watch keep me satiated with football please especially in these times larry leyba the more football that is shown on tv the more chance they have of getting my eyes on their product and i will explain why my team is outside of my market where i live i get three games during the morning and afternoon it’s always the cowboys broncos and one other game since my team is generally at the same time nd network the broncos i rarely get my team on tv unless they are playing denver now if there is a chance denver has a sunday night monday night or thursday night game i have a better chance of catching my team also if there are games on sunday monday and thursday night there is a better chance my am will be on on one of those nights over all i get a better chance my team will be on and that is only time i will watch oh and i am not going to be paying the nfl and direct tv hard arned money for the privilege of watching their product i have other important things to spend my money on like feeding and carting for my children wife and elderly mother i not a football fan i am a raider fan and if they are not on tv than i have no interest that’s why they have a better chance of catching my eyes if they have football every day of the week mrbull in theory she is right…it use to be just sunday’s in the morning and afternoon along with monday night… then came sunday night which seems logical…but now thursday’s…london and other foreign city games at real early hours…two games on monday night to open the season and the season opener on thursday night…just ridiculous… much like college football is pushing over saturation on days beyond saturday the nfl is doing the same… cut it back to sundays and monday night… jim it’s not the number of quality games every week i think most of the games are quality games the real problem seems to be trying to find quality commentators and analysts collingsworth sims aikman buck and too many more to mention they all stink there are one or two really good ones but the majority of them just plain suck i have been watching the games on mute so that i don’t have to listen to them ramble on about this or that i’m not sure most of them are even aware there’s a game they’re supposed to be talking about get better announcers you’ll get better results but i think the problem with viewership lies with the lousy commentators bo lasquis she’s not speaking for this consumer i love it dale moog she is right in theory but in practice she is wrong the biggest problem is the stupid thursday night package with half the games produced by nbc and half by cbs with all the games on nfl network but only some on nbc or cbs then you had twitter last year as the streaming site now this year it is amazon last year you could stream for free and this year you have to pay for amazon prime to be able to stream this is the third different thursday night rights package in three years not mention you add the london games that are on a different network each year and they added a th one this year plus the fact that they keep one jacksonville as a free streaming only game this year it is on a site most people have never heard of verzion go last year that game was on yahoo the days when you had sunday on cbs nbc and or fox sunday night on espn and monday night on abc are long gone get used to the crap that now is thursday night football chris macy of course cbs thinks the games are on too many networks they’d like cbs to be the only network broadcasting nfl games although i agree that the american public is stupid look who they elected in  i’m pretty sure they know how to find out which channel is broadcasting games sportsfan the nfl needs to fix the thursday night product by having those teams on a bye week before they play on thursday otherwise the only problem is with weak network announcing teams sarah the league can fix the problem easily but won’t how about no games on thursday simple solution not going to happen though “we care about he overall health and safety of the players” the league says then they show how much they “care” by having teams play  times in a  day span if that’s “caring” then that’s just more nonsense coming from the owners maybe when it comes time for the next cba the players simply refuse to sign any agreement unless the league drops the thursday night game pingback carlos henderson and isaiah

angerergetty images shari redstone has taken control at viacom inc after vanquishing challengers now comes the hard part deciding what to do with all that powerthe daughter of yearold billionaire sumner redstone whose frail health ignited the power struggle in which she triumphed is considering recombining viacom with cbs corp according to people familiar with the matter such a move would reunite the two pillars of the redstone family’s media empire though cbs shareholders may blanch at the idea of taking on viacom’s struggling cable networks and movie studiocbs whose chief executive officer leslie moonves has been on good terms with the redstones hasn’t received any indication that a deal is imminent according to a person familiar with the matter its board would need to support any transaction cbs declined to comment and shari who serves as vice chair of both companies didn’t respond to a request for comment a cbs merger is just one of many decisions the redstones will consider including how to boost the ratings of viacom networks and whether its creative leaders are the right ones the redstone family settled a threestate legal dispute with former ceo philippe dauman and board member george abrams earlier this month securing dauman’s exit and allowing people backed by shari redstone to join the board in key positions another legal matter was put to rest last week when keryn redstone shari’s niece dropped her opposition to the settlement in exchange for assurances that she would be treated equally in her grandfather’s trustcourtroom sideshowthe closing of that sideshow was one of the steps shari redstone needed to ensure she could direct the future of her father’s holdings before and after his death throughout this year’s legal battle she has said her views on viacom are aligned with her father’s she is quickly making her voice heard at viacom picking winners and losers after the revolutionin the past week viacom’s longtime head of

that was the original source of the family’s wealth a presence in the viacom boardroom for years she shares an opinionated streak with her father it looked as though shari might lose control earlier this year after dauman was named chairman of the company over her objectionstaking control“shari has done a masterful job reasserting herself at viacom” said paul sweeney a bloomberg intelligence analyst “les’s main strength is programming viacom is in dire need of improved programming at both its cable networks and its paramount film studio” cbs and viacom split in  in a deal that was supposed to let the highflying cable networks operate unencumbered by the slow steady broadcast businessbut industry upheaval and strategic missteps have led to falling ratings for some of viacom’s most important cable channels such as mtv and comedy central while its film unit paramount pictures has been mired in last place among the major studios with bombs such as this year’s “whiskey tango foxtrot” “zoolander ” and “benhur”for more on the travails at paramount pictures click herecbs under moonves has been the mostwatched broadcast network  of the last  years and its showtime cable channel has also drawn more viewers with hits such as “homeland” now it is cbs that could be dragged down by viacom’s slower growth with more viewers shutting off cable altogether in favor of streaming video such as netflix and youtubeviacom would give cbs a broader portfolio of networks and give moonves a rare opportunity to own a major hollywood studio which could make it easier to create and acquire programming all of cbs’s major broadcast rivals  abc nbc and fox  are part of corporations that include top film studios“the programmers need to consolidate” said sal muoio a new yorkbased money manager with  viacom shares “there could be a big deal probably involving viacom”moonves with his record of success would be the natural pick to run the combined company shari has warmed to dooley despite his many years working alongside dauman people familiar with the matter said but he remains ceo on only an interim basis until the board decides at the end of september whether to make him viacom’s permanent leadershareholders would be better off selling the company to the outside buyer than effecting a merger of equals with cbs said muoio who considers viacom “worth over  a share” that’s more than twice friday’s closing price of the reach of cbs’s broadcast network and its sports programming would be key to helping viacom negotiate better terms from paytv distributors according to matt harrigan an analyst with wunderlich securities“that certainly makes the most sense in the long term” he said— with assistance by crayton harrison before its here its on

trouble in the house of redstone starting with nothing more than a local theater chain and a streak of ambition the redstones built a media empire that ultimately would span the globe– then spent years fighting over it now the family is engaged in its biggest battle yet between sumner redstone and his enigmatic daughter shari could this be the final act for one of the greatest business dynasties boston has ever seen by luke obrien  boston magazine  december  illustration by sean mccabe a shopping mall in dedham is a curious place to witness the waning days of an empire then again life has always been curious when the redstone family is involved from here in dedham sumner redstone transformed his family’s modest theater business national amusements into a mighty kingdom that now extends into almost every corner of the media and entertainment industries through national amusements sumner orchestrated the takeovers of viacom in  and cbs in  as well as their related fiefdoms mtv nickelodeon simon  schuster et al it was a power grab with few parallels in the history of american business today the redstone holdings encompass more than  billion in assets making sumner one of the wealthiest men in the world he is now  and his legend is secure what he leaves behind is not which brings us to the new legacy place shopping mall where sumner’s old offices have given way to a banana republic and a p f chang’s and where there now hulks a screen showcase cinema de lux the mall’s centerpiece the massive theater represents national amusements’ attempt to establish itself as a luxury brand on this cloudless august day several hundred vip guests—a mix of tweedy countryclubbers and what passes for boston’s young and hip—have gathered to christen the building teen beauty queens greet the arrivals who sip cookiedough martinis in a swank lounge as waiters circulate with duck canapés tomorrow the theater will be serving salmon pinwheels and  burgers delivered to patrons who order via the touch of a button as they watch movies from ultraleather loveseats there are ice luges and free bags of popcorn a pianist on a baby grand plays hoary show tunes all that’s missing is the ghost of wallace hartley on fiddle at the center of the hubbub is a small woman in lilac and pearls a tiny fineboned creature with a familiar ginger dapple to her hair she is shari redstone sumner’s daughter president of national amusements caretaker of the family business through which sumner’s corporate interests are controlled after a series of musty aldermen take the stage to pay tribute to various regulatory bodies and other musty aldermen it’s shari’s turn to address the crowd she steps up to the podium even though her black pumps add a few inches she still has to lower the microphone she hardly needs one her voice lacquered with a thick boston accent is conditioned to shouting “my grandfather was a visionary” she begins “what i learned from him was the value of relationships” the crowd quiets shari describes how her beloved grandfather mickey laid the foundation for the redstone fortune she has spent most of the day talking up a bright future for national amusements behind the smile however is wistfulness “this has been a dream come true” she says “we have indeed come a long way… the business has continued to be founded on the principles and values that were so important to my grandfather i know that he’s up there smiling and his legacy will live on forever” when the speech is over the audience claps and files into theaters to watch free screenings by the time the credits roll the lobby will be empty the ice luges melted only popcorn left to sweep up on their way home few people will remember that in her speech about legacy shari redstone neglected to mention the father who had given her everything and who may yet take much of it away   as a private company national amusements is closely held its internal machinations shrouded from the public sumner owns  percent of the company and shari owns the rest yet because their majority voting stakes in viacom and cbs are held through national amusements the fates of several huge public corporations are subject in many ways to the whims of this famously peevish pair though shari was once sumner’s favored child and heir apparent the two have engaged in an epic if sometimes juvenile struggle for power in recent years she has challenged him over his salary and charitable giving while he has blasted her as being unqualified and ungrateful at one point the two were communicating only by fax until last year however there was little public understanding of what was truly at stake in their fight that changed on october   when it was revealed that national amusements was carrying more than a billion and a half dollars of debt the company had taken out two  million loans borrowed against the value of its stock holdings when the economy collapsed and the stock value began to slide those debts seemed potentially catastrophic suddenly a vast constellation of redstone properties looked vulnerable within days of the announcement shari and sumner were pointing fingers at each other over national’s predicament people in sumner’s camp told the wall street journal that “in large part the loan was used to expand the movietheater chain… shari redstone has been building the business aggressively” shari’s flacks countered by blaming the bad economy not the spending on new theaters in response to the crisis national amusements prepared to reduce its enormous debt by selling off most of its  multiplexes the plan would raise new doubts about shari’s future as sumner’s wouldbe successor—and presage an ignoble end to one of new england’s most storied family businesses   a simple question lay at the heart of the redstones’ blame game what were those illtimed loans used for sources confirm to boston that a big chunk of the money did in fact go toward expanding the chain the rest though was used by sumner on a stock play sumner had spent  years and an estimated  million buying an  percent stake in midway games a videogame company best known for the mortal kombat franchise in theory videogame characters and story lines could be parlayed into hollywood products which would generate gobs of cash but midway had been a dog for years losing  million from  through  alone shari had long opposed the midway investment but with only a minority stake in the family business all she could do was complain she grumbled even as her father installed her on the midway board in  for the “vainglorious oldschool egomaniac” as writer michael wolff once described sumner dissent verged on treason still shari grew angrier as sumner performed various feats of financial gymnastics to shuffle debt and stock in and out of national she disagreed with his business decisions but perhaps more than that she chafed at being reminded of her own lameduck status each time her father used national to bail himself out of a jam the flashpoint in their deepening fissure came when sumner’s lawyers cooked up a tax gambit for midway although the mortal kombat franchise alone was once valued at around  million according to sources sumner unloaded his full midway stake last year for a paltry  to a lucky private investor the goal was simple dump the stock and reap over  million in writeoffs for national to help ease its crushing debt however the giveaway accelerated midway’s descent into bankruptcy and dragged both redstones into a lawsuit in delaware that alleges they breached fiduciary duties by croaking the company to benefit themselves the debacle stands out as the worst investment of sumner’s career it also hastened the demise of his relationship with shari “the way you make a billion dollars is you ignore all the people who say you’re doing the wrong thing” says laura martin a media analyst for needham  company “sumner ignored them in midway and it didn’t work out for him” as costly as sumner’s midway folly may have been shari’s own ambitions for the family business weren’t cheap either while she disliked her father using national amusements for his own interests she poured money into the theater chain—a move that went against sumner’s wishes says a longtime family adviser who spoke with boston on the condition of anonymity “sumner didn’t want to build anymore he was ready to sell he didn’t want to spend a nickel more on the theaters” says the adviser “shari went the other route” why she hoped to prove herself “it was important to break out on my own and have something that was not my father’s territory” she told the new york times in  ‘‘i needed to find a way to differentiate myself from him” and if that meant defying her father so be it   emotional rot runs deep in the redstone family sumner’s parents mickey and belle were the children of jewish immigrants and they grew up hard a “crazy tyrant” is how sumner’s younger brother edward once described their mother “it was a dysfunctional family it really was and still is” edward said while being deposed in a recent court fight he called his father “mean and tough” mickey got his start as a streetsmart linoleum peddler and associate of harry “doc” sagansky an underworld figure known as boston’s biggest bookie mickey who had changed the family name from rothstein to sidestep the antisemitism of blueblood boston also palled around with former mayor john “honey fitz” fitzgerald legend holds that sagansky helped mickey get into the movie theater business in the s the redstone kids grew up selling popcorn at the concession stands sumner was always the favorite son a prodigy who graduated with what he claims is the highest gpa in the year history of the boston latin school by his early thirties he’d picked up multiple degrees from harvard worked as a codebreaker during world war ii and as a young lawyer successfully argued a case before the supreme court but sumner left his private law practice in  to take a job at mickey’s theater chain then called northeast theatre corporation edward who had already been working for their father was relegated to secondtier status “i had the more glamorous part of the company and i think he was hurt by that” sumner recalled in a deposition this year in  edward sued sumner and mickey arguing he’d been pushed out of the company—a move that earned him a terse letter from his mother “you have brought disgrace on you your family and all of us” belle wrote before closing on a note that says a lot about the prosaic nature of familial treachery in the redstone clan “the weather has been magnificent” after the two sides settled sumner’s stake in the company grew he seemed content to gradually expand the theater circuit which by the s had swelled from a dozen driveins to scores of indoor theaters but in  a brush with death at the copley plaza hotel changed everything at the time sumner reputedly was visiting his mistress in the hotel when a terrible fire broke out he clung to a thirdfloor windowsill with one hand as the blaze burned him horribly doctors didn’t expect him to live through the  hours of surgery he required much less walk again he did both as well as endured months of painful skin grafts the experience forged something in him he returned to work a different man with a new focus he wanted to build something bigger and to do that he needed control of national amusements by  sumner had bought out the shares owned by edward’s two children the trouble that befell sumner’s niece and nephew constitutes their own tragic tangent in the family saga edward’s daughter ruth ann disappeared in  after reportedly joining a cult called the children of god and turned up dead in  in japan ruth ann’s brother michael was hospitalized for mental illness he later went to work for sumner and eventually sold his shares to his uncle in a deal that would divide the two when michael contested it in court decades later with control of national amusements in hand sumner set out to conquer as much of the world as he could in  he was  and just getting started with  million in cash from national and more than  billion in loans he prevailed in a hostile takeover of viacom in  he scooped up paramount for  billion and blockbuster for nearly  billion in  he landed cbs for  billion at an age when most people have long since retired sumner made himself into one of america’s great entrepreneurs throwing elbows all the way of course the familial dysfunction didn’t diminish in  phyllis sumner’s wife of more than  years filed for divorce after her private detective photographed him canoodling with another woman this time in paris the split with phyllis would force sumner to part with hundreds of millions of dollars and to relinquish some of his prized control over his national shares dissolving the ties with his children though would come at a different price   to meet shari once is to be swayed by her energy to watch her over time is to see something different she never lets her guard down for years investors analysts and observers have wondered if she could be the next star in the redstone family they take her measure all they can do is speculate shari grew up in newton and went to newton south high about a mile from the family home on baldpate hill road she worked as a summer intern at paramount she graduated from tufts and then law school at boston university and toiled quietly as a criminaldefense lawyer and corporate attorney after marrying ira korff a rabbi in  she quit to raise children korff himself was brought into the family business serving as president of national amusements from  until  when he and shari divorced at the time shari was studying for a degree in social work but warmed to her father’s suggestion that she work part time for him “the culture of the company was that each generation would participate” sumner explained in a recent deposition by  shari had become president of national installed atop the business the same way mickey had elevated sumner four decades earlier shari does share certain traits with her father there is a ruthlessness beneath the pearls and her ascension to power has created its own casualties in the family chief among them is her brother brent who felt frozen out of the business people who know the yearold brent a former boston prosecutor and a train enthusiast say he is sweet and laidback similar to his mother in temperament “a niceenough fellow who was just ruined from an early age” says someone who has done business with the redstones “he’s not the kind of guy who his father respects he’s a sad soul” in  brent sued national amusements and ended up taking a  million buyout to be done with the company he now lives on a acre ranch in the mountains west of denver “it’s a repeat of what happened with sumner and his brother and his father” a family adviser says “it’s historic this has been playing itself out for the last   years” by the time shari took over the theater circuit national had gone global most notably in the united kingdom shari continued to expand overseas pushing deeper into brazil argentina and russia “she correctly sees russia as a huge market that’s almost untapped in terms of a modern cinema” says john fithian president of the national association of theatre owners shari also paved the way for the emergence of the upscale cinema market in  she helped develop the bridge in los angeles one of the first luxury theaters in california and a model for the cinema de lux line with its hip lounges and fullservice bars the bridge “forced people to take me seriously” shari said at the time it worked “she’s fearless with respect to trying new ideas” says frank rash a senior vice president at amc who worked with shari and other exhibitors to create the retail website movieticketscom “she’s been a pioneer… the advancement of food and beverage services and premium auditoriums—national amusements has been at that for a while and those things have been adopted throughout the industry” sumner always favored his flinty feisty daughter “sumner in a skirt” as a former viacom executive once described her but shari has none of her father’s outrageous charisma none of the big personality that pulls the oxygen from a room she’s an introvert “i live with myself” she has said shari does in fact live alone in westwood her three children are grown she has no significant other no connection to her only sibling and a toxic relationship with her father she is an inscrutable presence who may well love the glamour of her position but has chosen to fly under the radar she’s revealed few personal details over the years unsurprisingly she refused to be interviewed for this story just about the only thing shari will cop to enjoying is cooking she has said that she used to feel guilty if she didn’t cook for her children every night in  at a luncheon of women executives she discussed the joys of being a “stayathome mother who baked cookies” earlier this year shari managed to somehow sneak in a mention of baking pies—during a bankruptcy lawsuit “she does bake a mean chocolate chip cookie” admits one person who spoke on condition of anonymity beyond that there’s little to go on harmless questions forwarded to one of her many handlers—what’s shari’s favorite movie—elicit a fear response other banal queries are similarly offlimits what’s shari’s daily routine like what kind of hours does she work “i have never seen her give out those kinds of details even for some of the many profiles that have been done in the past at a very different time” says nancy sterling shari’s primary spokeswoman in an email according to people in the know shari has ensconced herself in her westwood home and her new york apartment and rarely visits the office they figure it’s too painful too embarrassing the blood is ankledeep on the floor thanks to some missteps in management for which she’s been blamed take national’s formerly bloated payrolls for example where other theaters might have one manager national often paid three or four says a family adviser “now they’re firing people left and right” he says some of them had worked for national since mickey’s day and many blame shari for the crisis and there’s another reason one family friend believes for shari’s absence as the business implodes she’s pouting “it’s all drama” says the friend “waiting for sumner to say ‘why don’t you go in’ it’s ridiculous” indeed it’s tough to find anyone to vouch for shari who doesn’t have skin in the game people she’s identified as her pals in the past—former paramount head sherry lansing for instance—refuse to return calls and others have already learned it’s better to keep mum than face the redstone wrath “over the years i have found that there is no percentage in this for me on or off the record” says former viacom ceo frank biondi echoing the sentiments of many associates contacted for this article it’s easier unfortunately to find those who offer up negative comments about shari “a spoiled brat” “too concerned about her image” and the most damning slight for a working woman “she’s no hillary” fair or not—and there are a great many people with blades ready when it comes to the redstones—the picture that emerges is of a smart strongwilled woman who can be compassionate but also inflexible an ambitious executive who thirsts for power but doesn’t realize what power requires an excellent generalist dedicated to the theater business who refuses a salary in dire times but a poor specialist who lacks the finesse and the chops to be a mogul like her father   next page you may
