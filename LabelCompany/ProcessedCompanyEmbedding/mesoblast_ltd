in japan the pharmaceuticals medical devices and other therapeutic products act pmd act took effect this act established a pathway for expedited approval in japan for regenerative medical products japan’s new policy requires an early stage clinical trial ie phase i or small phase ii at the minimum to confirm safety of the therapy and provide evidence of efficacy rather than requiring that the therapy then be evaluated in subsequent trials before making it available to patients japan’s new law will allow for a “conditional approval” enabling the product to be brought to market and for the product to obtain reimbursement in an accelerated manner conditional approval does not mean that the regulatory approval process is over it simply allows the therapy to be made available to patients earlier in the process and for the sponsor company to begin commercialization and obtain reimbursement as a result mesoblast announced they would leverage existing phase  clinical trial results for tier  and tier  product candidates tier  includes mpc cells for back pain conditional approval would last seven years in march  circulation journal published  results of a clinical trial using mpcs as

the treatment of chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration edit in early  the us government website that lists mesoblasts study provided key milestones the estimated completion date is february  the estimated primary completion date will be february  this is the final data collection date for primary outcome measure the only way these dates might change is if mesoblasts solution for lower back pain is granted fast track status from the fda this would reduce the fdas review process from  months to  months it would also provide a streamlined rolling review process completed sections of the biologics license application bla can be submitted for fda review as they become available instead of waiting for all to be completed in march  mesoblast announced positive results of their  month followup of their randomized placebocontrolled  patient phase  trial a single intradiscal injection of  million mpcs resulted in meaningful improvements in both pain and function that were durable for at least  months “the sustained benefits on pain and function over three years seen with a single injection of mesoblast’s cell therapy have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration” said trial investigator dr hyun bae professor of surgery and director of education at the cedars sinai spine center and director of the spine institute in los angeles ca “instead of replacing or fusing the disc there is mounting compelling evidence that we can use this regenerative medicine to heal the disc we are fast approaching this inflection point in the treatment of low back pain which is particularly important in view of the epidemic of opioid abuse in may  mesoblast noted in the rd quarter report that they target patient enrollment completion of the phase  back pain trial by the end of   criticismedit mesoblasts solution for back pain came under heavy criticism from competitor regenexx in august  dr chris centeno said the trial results were spit shined with confusing and misleading language press releases for phases  and  did not include images of mris to prove that discs were regenerated and expressed doubts about maintaining cell quality while massproducing cells he also said the hosts immune system removes the injected stem cells centeno said whenever you see a company drop key imaging results that are needed to impress insurers like positive mri changes in the spine you can almost bet that there are serious troubles brewing then when you observe that what should take a few sentences to describe whether or not the product helped pain and function actually takes an entire page of reported numbers sliced and diced  different ways you know there are serious issues rheumatoid arthritisedit on january

acquisitions manufacturing and financing  financial performance  references mesenchymal lineage cellsedit the company is developing a range of regenerative products derived from its proprietary mesenchymal lineage cells this includes mesenchymal precursor cells mpcs and mesenchymal stem cells mscs useedit highly purified and immunoselected mpcs and the culture expanded mscs give rise to secrete trophic factors that then exert multiple mechanisms of action mesenchymal lineage precursors have the ability to detect injury and inflammation and respond to local stimuli and signals from the injured tissue by releasing a wide range of biomolecules growth factors chemokines enzymes etc that induce the body’s own tissue to grow and regenerate effectively repairing the injury which specific factors are released by the mesenchymal precursors in any given tissue presumably depends on the signals they encounter from the damaged tissue itself for example with back pain the mpcs are injected into the damaged disc in order to regenerate it much like a tire jack it reinflates the degenerated disc to provide the spine the stability and flexibility it once had medical problemsedit back painedit back pain is the number one cause of disability worldwide in the united states alone there are over  million patients suffering from chronic back pain that has persisted for three months or more in  the cdcs national center for health statistics reported that low back pain was the leading cause of pain affecting  of american adults the united states lifetime prevalence of low back pain is estimated to be at least  the total costs of low back pain are estimated to be between  billion and  billion annually two thirds of which are due to decreased wages and productivity current treatments include physical therapy steroid injections light exercise massage and pain killers if those treatments fail then potentially invasive and costly surgery is usually recommended but not always successful congestive heart failureedit according to the center for disease control and prevention about  million people in the united states have heart failure approximately half of people who develop heart failure die within five years of diagnosis in addition it is estimated that heart failure costs the us  billion each year this includes the cost of medications health care services and lost productivity at work graftversushost diseaseedit graftversushost disease gvhd is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in which the newly transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipients body crohns diseaseedit crohns disease is a chronic inflammation of the digestive track this includes the mouth esophagus small intestine large intestine stomach rectum and anus treatment may include a combination of drugs nutrition supplements and surgery the goals of treatment are to ease the symptoms control inflammation and improve nutrition currently there is no cure for crohns disease however people can have a long period of remission where they are symptom free drugs may include antiinflammation steroids cortisone immune system suppressors remicade antibiotics antidiarrheal and fluid replacements research and developmentedit mesoblast seeks to treat ailments in four major areas immunologic and inflammatory – cells are administered intravenously to impart immunomodulatory effects cardiac and vascular – cells are administered locally with the aim of improving heart anatomy and function orthopedic diseases of the spine – cells are locally administered to potentially repair intervertebral discs or generate new bone oncology  improving outcomes of bone marrow transplantation in patients with cancer or genetic diseases back painedit mesoblast’s investigational product candidate mpcid is being developed to target the population of patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic low back pain due to moderately degenerated discs edit in mesoblasts annual report from august  the company first announced positive results of preclinical trials showing radiographic and pathologic disc regeneration with mpcid mesoblast said they were in the process of completing an investigational new drug ind submission to the united states fda to commence phase  clinical trials in patients with low back pain due to disc degenerative disease edit on june   mesoblast announced that it received clearance from the food and drug administration to begin a phase  trial with its mpc cells for treatment of disc degenerative disease this trial is primarily designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the cells edit in january  mesoblast announced positive results of the phase  trial for back pain treatment it included  patients with moderate to severe back pain that were evaluated in a randomized placebo controlled study patients were treated across  sites in the us and australia the results showed that  of patients given a  million dose of mpcs and  given an  million dose experienced a more than  reduction in low back pain at  months this compares to around  for the controls patients underwent the outpatient injection for a single painful degenerated lumbar level and are being evaluated for safety and efficacy over a total of  months to evaluate longterm treatment effects other key findings included improvements in function and disc stability the participating sites were arizona pain specialists uc davis spine center the spine institute ipm medical group inc denver spine rocky mountain associates in orthopedic medicine pc emory university school of medicine carolina neurosurgery and spine associates central texas spine institute richmond bone and joint clinic memorial hermann medical group washington center for pain management the center for pain relief inc and monash medical center of victoria australia mesoblast ceo silviu itescu said the company would then plan to meet with regulators in major jurisdictions across the us to discuss product registration in august  mesoblast announced in its  results and corporate strategy that the food and drug administration granted approval to advance to an mpc phase  trial for chronic lower back pain phase  will begin before the end of  mesoblast ceo silviu itescu estimated phase  completion within – years meaning sometime in late  or  based on the fdas processing time mpc cells for back pain are projected to be commercially available between  and  in november  in japan the pharmaceuticals medical devices and other therapeutic products act pmd act took effect this act established a pathway for expedited approval in japan for regenerative medical products japan’s new policy requires an early stage clinical trial ie phase i or small phase ii at the minimum to confirm safety of the therapy and provide evidence of efficacy rather than requiring that the therapy then be evaluated in subsequent trials before making it available to patients japan’s new law will allow for a “conditional approval” enabling the product to be brought to market and for the product to obtain reimbursement in an accelerated manner conditional approval does not mean that the regulatory approval process is over it simply allows the therapy to be made available to patients earlier in the process and for the sponsor company to begin commercialization and obtain reimbursement as a result mesoblast announced they would leverage existing phase  clinical trial results for tier  and tier  product candidates tier  includes mpc cells for back pain conditional approval would last seven years in march  circulation journal published  results of a clinical trial using mpcs as adjunctive therapy for patients with a ventricular assist device  of patients with mpc therapy achieved temporary weaning from lvad compared to  of the control group at days edit on january   mesoblast confirmed phase  had already begun the company also provided projected timeframes mesoblast anticipates patient enrollment completion in mid an interim analysis in mid and topline data in mid the objective of the phase  clinical program will be to confirm the positive outcomes seen in the company’s phase  clinical trial where product candidate mpcid demonstrated the potential to provide durable improvement in pain and function for patients who suffer with cdlbp due to degenerative disc disease the primary endpoint in the phase  program will seek to confirm the treatment benefit seen in phase  for mpcid against saline control using a composite of durable improvement in pain and function on february   mesoblast was granted a key patent by the united states patent and trademark office uspto covering its proprietary mesenchymal precursor cell mpc technology for use in the treatment of degenerated intervertebral discs granted us patent number  provides mesoblast with exclusive commercial rights through to june  there is also potential for patent term and regulatory exclusivity extensions which would provide longer term protection on march   mesoblast announced that it has been selected by the japan external trade organization jetro as the only regenerative medicine company worldwide to receive fast track access to potential investment incentives across all levels of government in japan mesoblast will receive a specially tailored market and government incentive roadmap aimed at providing a more attractive business environment mesoblast chief executive silviu itescu welcomed the recognition from the japanese government “japan is a major market for our cellbased therapeutics and offers nearterm potential for product approvals and revenues the selection of mesoblast by jetro as the only regenerative medicine company to receive investment priority status will guide the strategic direction of our commercial plans in japan in conjunction with our current and future strategic partners” on april   mesoblast announced it intended to expand the phase  clinical program of its product candidate mpcid in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease to include sites in the european union eu this announcement came shortly after a positive meeting with the european medicines agency ema the discussions with ema occurred as part of combined scientific and reimbursement advice under an eu pilot program known as shaping european early dialogues seed the seed pilot program was established to facilitate early dialogue between ema european health technology assessment hta reimbursement bodies and selected companies with latestage clinical development programs mesoblasts product candidate mpcid is one of only seven medicines accepted for the seed program on september   mesoblasts annual report stated that phase  would actually consist of two clinical trials the first trial initiated in december  has been recruiting candidates across multiple sites in the

pain is estimated to be at least  the total costs of low back pain are estimated to be between  billion and  billion annually two thirds of which are due to decreased wages and productivity current treatments include physical therapy steroid injections light exercise massage and pain killers if those treatments fail then potentially invasive and costly surgery is usually recommended but not always successful congestive heart failureedit according to the center for disease control and prevention about  million people in the united states have heart failure approximately half of people who develop heart failure die within five years of diagnosis in addition it is estimated that heart failure costs the us  billion each year this includes the cost of medications health care services and

degenerative disease edit on june   mesoblast announced that it received clearance from the food and drug administration to begin a phase  trial with its mpc cells for treatment of disc degenerative disease this trial is primarily designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the cells edit in january  mesoblast announced positive results of the phase  trial for back pain treatment it included  patients with moderate to severe back pain that were evaluated in a randomized placebo controlled study patients were treated across  sites in the us and australia the results showed that  of patients given a  million dose of mpcs and  given an  million dose experienced a more than  reduction in low back pain at  months this compares to around  for the controls patients underwent the outpatient injection for a single painful degenerated lumbar level and are being evaluated for safety and efficacy over a total of  months to evaluate longterm treatment effects other key findings included

therapeutic products act pmd act took effect this act established a pathway for expedited approval in japan for regenerative medical products japan’s new policy requires an early stage clinical trial ie phase i or small phase ii at the minimum to confirm safety of the therapy and provide evidence of efficacy rather than requiring that the therapy then be evaluated in subsequent trials before making it available to patients japan’s new law will allow for a “conditional approval” enabling the product to be brought to market and for the product to obtain reimbursement in an accelerated manner conditional approval does not mean that the regulatory approval process is over it simply allows the therapy to be made available to patients earlier in the process and for the sponsor company to begin commercialization and obtain reimbursement as a result mesoblast announced they would leverage existing phase  clinical trial results for tier  and tier  product candidates tier  includes mpc

degeneration edit in early  the us government website that lists mesoblasts study provided key milestones the estimated completion date is february  the estimated primary completion date will be february  this is the final data collection date for primary outcome measure the only way these dates might change is if mesoblasts solution for lower back pain is granted fast track status from the fda this would reduce the fdas review process from  months to  months it would also provide a streamlined rolling review process completed sections of the biologics license application bla can be submitted for fda review as they become available instead of waiting for all to be completed in march  mesoblast announced positive results of their  month followup of their randomized placebocontrolled  patient phase  trial a single intradiscal injection of  million mpcs resulted in meaningful improvements in both pain and function that were durable for at least  months “the sustained benefits on pain and function over three years seen with a single injection of mesoblast’s cell therapy have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration” said trial investigator dr hyun bae professor of surgery and director of education at the cedars sinai spine center and director of the spine institute in los angeles ca “instead of replacing or fusing the disc there is mounting compelling evidence that we can use this regenerative medicine to heal the disc we are fast approaching this inflection point in the treatment of low back pain which is particularly important in view of the epidemic of opioid abuse in may  mesoblast noted in the rd quarter report that they target patient enrollment completion of the phase  back pain trial by the end of   criticismedit mesoblasts solution for back pain came under heavy criticism from competitor regenexx in august  dr chris centeno said the trial results were spit shined with confusing and misleading language press releases for phases  and  did not include images of mris to prove that discs were regenerated and expressed doubts about maintaining cell quality while massproducing cells he also said the hosts immune system removes the injected stem cells centeno said whenever you see a company drop key imaging results that are needed to impress insurers like positive mri changes in the spine you can almost bet that there are serious troubles brewing then when you observe that what should take a few sentences to describe whether or not the product helped pain and function actually takes an entire page of reported numbers sliced and diced  different ways you know there are serious issues rheumatoid arthritisedit on january   announced results showing
