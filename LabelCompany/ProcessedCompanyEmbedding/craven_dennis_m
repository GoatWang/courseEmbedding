add to basket add to wishlist description a volume in international advances in self research series editors herbert w marsh rhonda g craven and dennis m mcinerney this volume deals with a wealth of issues related to self from the overarching theoretical perspective of bandura and his careful and thorough analysis of the agentic self highlighting the complexities of our multiple selves acting in an integrated holistic and dynamic fashion to the engaging and novel treatment of selfconcept as a rope by john hattie from many of the chapters we see the utility value of the social cognitive theory and selfdetermination theory frameworks for interpreting selfprocesses and how these processes might drive engagement in learning in particular we see how autonomy support selfregulation selfefficacy and selfregulation are part and parcel of selfprocesses intimately involved as individuals work out their futures and possible selves entwined with these processes are the development of identity resilience and a sense of wellbeing the bflpe and bullying chapters provide two examples of selfprocesses in operation in the school context what can we take from thisselfprocesses are complex differentiatedand yet coordinated by focusing on the agentic self we consider the whole personpicture as a rich integrated and dynamic tapestry and by focusing on differentiated self elements such as selfregulation selfdetermination selfconcept and selfefficacy we are able to examine in more detail some of the individual threads of the tapestry and the roles they play in the integrated self overall we learn that selfprocesses are dynamic and are fundamental to enabling human potentialshow more product details format paperback   pages dimensions  x  x mm  g publication date  mar
