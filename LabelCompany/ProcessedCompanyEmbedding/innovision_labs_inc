notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   referred to as the  form k there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates previously reported in our  form k our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires that management make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our unaudited interim financial statements critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that our accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition intangible assets convertible notes and stock based compensation are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates we believe there have been no material changes in our existing accounting policies and estimates from the
