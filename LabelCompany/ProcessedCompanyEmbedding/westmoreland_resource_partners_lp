ohio coal facts — westmoreland resource partners lp menu ▼ ohio coal facts history of ohio coal mining coal mining in ohio began around  with reported production amounting to  tons of coal mined from jefferson county since  over  billion tons of coal have been mined in ohio ohio’s coal production has experienced a history of great fluctuation during the first half of the th century coal production never exceeded one million tons annually coal was cut and loaded entirely by hand and transported to local markets by means of wagons carts and flatboats as ohio transformed into an industrial state in the late s it became one of the largest coalproducing and coalconsuming states in the nation during world war i ohio’s coal industry realized production levels that would not be seen again until the s in  ohio’s coal work force swelled to its greatest level of more than  individuals today ohio’s coal industry employs up to  individuals this decline is due in part to decreased production and technological advances however these advances have allowed productivity rates to soar reaching an astonishing average of about  tons per miner per hour or  tons in a single hour day during the interwar period coal production sagged but quickly regained momentum following world war ii this time period saw the advent of large efficient excavating equipment new drilling techniques and newly developed explosives making earthmoving operations possible thus surface mining operations became an economic alternative to underground mining surface mining involves the excavation of all the rock and soil above the desired coal seam exposing it at the surface with the rise of surface mining coal production steadily increased until  since this time production has decreased this decline is due in part to increased transportation costs but primarily to the significant impact of the federal clean air act which placed stringent controls on emissions particularly so emissions from coalfired power plants ohio coal facts ohio ranks th nationally in coal consumption trailing only texas indiana and illinois ohio ranks th nationally in industrial energy consumption ohio ranks th nationally in coal reserves ohio ranks th nationally in coal production approximately  percent of ohio’s electricity is generated by coal compared to  percent nationwide and  percent worldwide ohio is home to  major coalbased electricity generating plants in  the average miner produced  tons per hour – today the number has risen to  tons per hour largely through technological advancements coal is currently mined in  ohio counties and has been mined in  total counties since mining began in the early th century  percent of mined ohio coal is transported by trains with the balance being trucked and barged
