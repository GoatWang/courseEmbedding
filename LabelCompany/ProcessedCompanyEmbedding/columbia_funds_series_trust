trust includes oversight with respect to various risk management functions the funds are subject to a number of risks including investment compliance operational and valuation risks among others daytoday risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the adviser the subadvisers and other service providers depending on the nature of the risk who carry out the funds investment management and business affairs each of the adviser the subadvisers and other service providers has its own independent interest in risk management and its policies and methods of carrying out risk management functions will depend in part on its analysis of the risks functions and business models risk oversight forms part of the boards general oversight of the funds and is addressed as part of various board and committee activities the board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect a fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or even mitigate their occurrence or effects as part of its regular oversight of the trust the board directly or through a committee interacts with and reviews reports from among others the adviser subadvisers the independent registered public accounting firm for the funds and internal auditors for the adviser or its affiliates as appropriate regarding risks faced by the funds and relevant risk functions the board also meets periodically with the funds cco to receive reports regarding the compliance of the funds and their principal service providers with the federal securities laws and their internal compliance policies and procedures the board with the assistance of the investment review committee reviews investment policies in connection with its review of the funds performance and meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the funds to receive reports regarding the management of the funds including various investment risks as part of the boards periodic review of the funds advisory subadvisory and other service provider agreements the board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible in addition the board oversees processes that are in place to assure compliance with applicable rules regulations and investment policies and addresses possible conflicts of interest committees of the board the board has organized the following standing committees to facilitate its work board governance committee compliance committee contracts committee executive committee investment review committee and audit committee these committees are comprised solely of independent trustees for these purposes persons who are not affiliated persons of the adviser or ameriprise financial the table above describing each trustee also includes their respective committee memberships the duties of these committees are described below    mr lewis as chair of the board acts as a point of contact between the independent trustees and the adviser between board meetings in respect of general matters board governance committee  recommends to the board the size structure and composition of the board and its committees the compensation to be paid to members of the board and a process for evaluating the boards performance the committee also reviews candidates for board membership including candidates recommended by shareholders the committee also makes recommendations to the board regarding responsibilities and duties of the board oversees proxy voting and supports the work of the board chair in relation to furthering the interests of the funds and their shareholders on external matters to be considered as a candidate for trustee recommendations must include a curriculum vitae and be mailed to the chair of the board columbia family of funds  marquette avenue south suite  minneapolis mn  to be timely for consideration by the committee the submission including all required information must be submitted in writing not less than  days before the date of the proxy statement for the previous years annual meeting of shareholders if such a meeting is held the committee will consider only one candidate submitted by such a shareholder or group for nomination for election at a meeting of shareholders the committee will not consider selfnominated candidates or candidates nominated by members of a candidates family including such candidates spouse children parents uncles aunts grandparents nieces and nephews the committee will consider and evaluate candidates submitted by the nominating shareholder or group on the basis of the same criteria as those used to consider and evaluate candidates submitted from other sources the committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering trustee candidates including but not limited to i the candidates knowledge in matters relating to the investment company industry ii any experience possessed by the candidate as a trustee or senior officer of other public or private companies iii the candidates educational background iv the candidates reputation for high ethical standards and personal and professional integrity v any specific financial technical or other expertise possessed by the candidate and the extent to which such expertise would complement the boards existing mix of skills and qualifications vi the candidates perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the board including the candidates ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly work collaboratively with other members of the board and carry out his or her duties in the best interests of the fund vii the candidates ability to qualify as an independent trustee and viii such other criteria as the committee determines to be relevant in light of the existing composition of the board and any anticipated vacancies or other factors members of the committee andor the board also meet personally with each nominee to evaluate the candidates ability to work effectively with other members of the board while also exercising independent judgment although the board does not have a formal diversity policy the board endeavors to comprise itself of members with a broad mix of professional and personal backgrounds thus the committee and the board accorded particular weight to the individual professional background of each independent trustee as encapsulated in their bios included in the table above the board believes that the funds are wellserved by a board the membership of which consists of persons that represent a broad mix of professional and personal backgrounds in considering nominations the committee takes the following matrix into account in assessing how a candidates professional background would fit into the mix of experiences represented by the thencurrent board             professional background name    geographic    for profitciocfoceocoo    nonprofitgovernmentceo    investment

tauntonrigby    ma    x       x             x santomero    pa       x             x    with respect to the trusteeship of mr truscott who is not an independent trustee the committee and the board have concluded that having a senior member of the adviser serve on the board can facilitate the independent trustees increased access to information regarding the funds adviser which is the funds most significant service provider with respect to the trusteeship of dr santomero the committee and the board have concluded that despite his lack of technical independence of the funds under the  act arising from his board service to citigroup inc and citigroup na he could serve with substantive independence primarily since he has no financial interest or relationship with the adviser or ameriprise financial the committee and the board also took into account dr santomeros broad array of experiences from management consulting to academia to public service which can complement well the mix of experiences represented by the other board members compliance committee  supports the funds maintenance of a strong compliance program by providing a forum for independent trustees to consider compliance matters impacting the funds or their key service providers developing and implementing in coordination with the funds cco a process for the review and consideration of compliance reports that are provided to the board and providing a designated forum for the funds cco to meet with independent trustees on a regular basis to discuss compliance matters contracts committee 

bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
