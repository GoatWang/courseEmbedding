phillips petroleum company during his tenure at phillips mulva guided the company into profitable markets in europe and russia and headed the successful merger of phillips with conoco to form conocophillips coworkers and industry peers described mulva as a capable leader who was able to implement new technology learn from other companies mistakes and direct financial decisions to meet and exceed corporate goals an introduction to the importance of oil after graduating from the university of texas with a bba in finance and an mba in business administration mulva immediately james j mulva apwide world photos  began a tour of duty in the us navy during his first two years in the navy he was stationed on bahrain island at that time bahrain and saudi arabia were producing enormous amounts of oil and natural gas and mulva was able to learn about the size and importance of the energy industry after exposure to the production side of the sector mulva became intrigued by the complexity and geopolitical impact of the financial aspects of the energy industry using financial skills in a corporate setting in  mulva completed his tour of duty in the navy and decided to enter the energy industry in the financial end of the business during his job search mulva found a position in the treasury department at phillips petroleum company that was a good entrylevel fit this job provided mulva with the challenge he was looking for as well as practical financial knowledge and an introduction to the petroleum industry although mulva had begun at phillips without a plan to become a highlevel executive he was promoted based on his hard work and his ability to analyze a situation and determine a solution that resulted in profit to the company going global mulva worked carefully through successive positions at phillips to build the companys longterm security and assets this work called for an understanding of the global market and culture before many us companies in the sector had ventured outside the united states as vice president and treasurer of the europeafrica division of phillips from  to  mulva had to make critical oilrelated decisions about where to focus assets during a time when many oil companies were drilling in the middle east mulva avoided middle eastern oil purchases and concentrated instead on new finds in other world locations for example in  phillips began focusing on the first offshore oil field in china to begin oil production after becoming ceo of phillips in  mulva continued this trend to keep assets focused in the north sea venezuela asia north america kazakhstan and russia by concentrating on new markets in europe south america and asia mulva made a stable longterm investment that avoided acquisition of assets in volatile middle east reserves mulva did not completely avoid volatile markets in june  when russia began to privatize its oil industry mulva strongly pursued a  percent share of the russian oil company lukoil he believed that he would have the ability to make the companies more efficient and profitable and increase assets while stabilizing the russian economy although mulva felt that his plan would enhance the business and social climate in russia the longterm success of mulvas russian proposal was still unknown in the early s beyond purchasing assets in foreign markets mulva tried to pass on to his counterparts in foreign oil companies some of the knowledge he gained by entering the global market early in its development mulva focused on executives in foreign oil companies in such countries as russia and china by helping them train their management personnel handle new technology and cooperate with transnational companies not just gas although phillips petroleum corporation was not immediately associated with plastics production a large portion of the global industry mulva was working with in asia included production of polyethylene plastics made from natural gas liquids in  mulva assisted phillips in creating a joint venture agreement to produce polyethylene plastic in china by the time mulva became ceo in  phillips was also involved in the manufacture of polyolefin plastics and other chemicals new technology mulvas career in the petroleum industry spanned several technological changes in the way the industry obtained oil the landbased oil derricks in oklahoma discovered by the phillips brothers had been replaced by offshore drilling and creation of pipelines new refinery processes meant application of new technology and with it new regulations in the face of these changes mulva advocated creation of a federal system of regulations that refiners should accept because that is what their customers stakeholders and constituents are demanding  oil daily  march   in  mulva led conocophillips to join a us department of energy pilot project experimenting with the use of hydrogenbased transportation as part of the project conocophillips planned to equip several fueling stations with the ability to dispense liquid and gaseous hydrogen made from both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources although the hydrogenbased technology was in its infancy the project allowed conocophillips and the other members of the project team to evaluate hydrogens potential as a new transportation technology mulva recognized that to ensure longterm growth for the company conocophillips had to become a leader in the pursuit and implementation of cleaner energy sources mulva underlined his commitment to new sources of fuel by actively seeking out such projects as the us department of energy pilot project on hydrogenbased technology in addition to leading the industry in the examination of new technology mulva looked toward increased benefits for customers mulva and his team developed the conocophillips fleet card a credit card that can be used at conoco gas stations phillips  gas stations and  gas stations unlike other gas company cards it is accepted at many local maintenance facilities as well to assist clients with tracking and paying their bills online account management is available management style mulvas financial background allowed him to analyze new ideas and proposals carefully to examine the bottom line and effectively to predict the ideas longterm financial impact on the firm this methodical approach helped him create a strategic plan to meet and exceed corporate goals and decide which new technologies would be profitable mulva also maintained a level of transparency in his actions that emphasized his honesty in business as he frequently said if you dont have your health and your integrity you dont have much to offer  conocophillips newsroom  may   this transparency increased in importance in  when it was learned that energy executives at enron an interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline company also involved in trade of commodities had manipulated financial statements to create an illusion of success the discovery of the deception resulted in a financial crash that lost investors money and bankrupted the company after the enron scandal regulators took a close look at other energy companies and their executives mulvas policy of transparency and honesty protected phillips from suspicions of financial mismanagement in  mulvas peers acknowledged his leadership and ability in an increasingly difficult business environment by presenting to him the petroleum executive of the year award community outreach given phillipss global presence mulva felt that it was important to try to bring something other than jobs and oil to its operation locations primary among these goals was mulvas desire to ensure that the companys operations did not have an adverse impact on community health and safety this meant that proper safety measures had to be put in place to avoid increases in air water and land pollution as well as to protect the community from product spills also important to mulva was the concept of contributing to the communities in which phillipss employees worked phillips and later conocophillips supported business internship programs continued scholarship programs such as the phillips ers scholarship program and established the phillips petroleum endowed professorships and exchange fellowships environmental concerns in  mulva faced a tragic situation when a kresin chemical tank exploded at a phillips petroleum company chemical plant in pasadena the explosion killed one worker seriously burned four workers and injured  other employees the resulting fire also produced toxic fumes that spread over the surrounding neighborhoods the blast was especially worrisome because it was the third time in  years that an explosion had occurred at that plant in the wake of the disaster mulva had to answer accusations that phillipss attempts to cut costs had endangered their employees created an unsafe work environment and resulted in the large explosions to salvage phillipss reputation for safety and its concern for its workers mulva and phillips paid a large occupational safety and health administration osha fine for safety violations concentrated on improving plant safety and cooperated with investigators to help establish accountability for the explosions following the  exxon valdez incident in which approximately  million gallons of oil were spilled out of a damaged oil tanker off the coast of alaska worldwide public attention was focused on petroleum companies and their environmental records although mulvas time as ceo did not begin until five years after the spill the valdez s legacy and legislation were a constant concern that shaped the operations of the petroleum company as phillipss ceo mulva focused on the environmental impact of petroleum operations he was determined to learn how to increase phillipss holdings of oil through exploration and production without damaging the environment given the ability of most of phillipss products to cause environmental destruction if spilled mulva directed frequent safety inspections of production operations trained employees in safe practices and instituted more safety measures to ensure that an incident like the valdez accident would not occur careful acquisitions and mergers lead to profit as ceo of phillips mulva created a fiveyear strategic plan that used several mergers and acquisitions to make the company more competitive and increase oil exploration and production through increasing oil exploration and production phillips hoped to avoid being taken over by the huge companies resulting from the mergers of mediumsized businesses such as exxon and mobil and chevron and texaco in february  phillips joined its chemical and plastic operations with chevron to create the chevron phillips chemical company for phillips the plastics and chemical portion of the company began to decline in strategic importance as an asset as phillips focused on a new strategic plan for the oilandgas sector of the business and a series of explosions at phillips plants in  and  created public image problems through the spinoff and joint venture mulva helped create a global chemical production company with an excellent financial position more assets and enhanced growth prospects in april  mulva led phillips in the acquisition of the alaskan oilandgas production assets of the atlantic richfield company in an attempt to boost its upstream exploration and production the alaskan assets were sold to satisfy the terms of a legal settlement that resulted from the large bp amocoarco merger the assets augmented phillipss holdings in a nonvolatile location and increased the companys barrels of oil equivalence to  billion reserve barrels of oil and  thousand new barrels per day of production the  merger with the tosco corporation a refining marketing and transmission business helped phillips grow its refining business to become the second largest in the united states and the thirdlargest seller of motor gasoline in the united states phillips also added toscos large convenience store market and  gas stations to its lists of assets next came phillipss merger with conoco to become conocophilips nationally this merger moved the combined company to a position as the largest refiner in the united states and the thirdlargest energy company internationally the merger put conocophillips into position as the sixthlargest energy company in the world at the time mulva became ceo in  the companys assets were about  billion after the merger was completed in  the companys assets exceeded  billion mulva had learned more about large oil company mergers by watching carefully the successes and failures of the merger of mobil and exxon in  and chevron and texaco in  he chose a financial strategy that focused more on saving money and cutting capital spending than on growth in the first years the strategy produced enhanced financial returns and less debt for conocophillips by the end of the first quarter of  the company had an income of  billion and had come very close to paring its debt down to  percent of its capital see also entry on phillips petroleum

conference  address conocophillips  north dairy ashford po box  houston texas  httpwwwconocophillipscom ■ james mulva served as president and chief executive officer of phillips petroleum company during his tenure at phillips mulva guided the company into profitable markets in europe and russia and headed the successful merger of phillips with conoco to form conocophillips coworkers and industry peers described mulva as a capable leader who was able to implement new technology learn from other companies mistakes and direct financial decisions to meet and exceed corporate goals an introduction to the importance of oil after graduating from the university of texas with a bba in finance and an mba in business administration mulva immediately began a tour of duty in the us navy during his first two years in the navy he was stationed on bahrain island at that time bahrain and saudi arabia were producing enormous amounts of oil and natural gas and mulva was able to learn about the size and importance of the energy industry after exposure to the production side of the sector mulva became intrigued by the complexity and geopolitical impact of the financial aspects of the energy industry using financial skills in a corporate setting in  mulva completed his tour of duty in the navy and decided to enter the energy industry in the financial end of the business during his job search mulva found a position in the treasury department at phillips petroleum company that was a good entrylevel fit this job provided mulva with the challenge he was looking for as well as practical financial knowledge and an introduction to the petroleum industry although mulva had begun at phillips without a plan to become a highlevel executive he was promoted based on his hard work and his ability to analyze a situation and determine a solution that resulted in profit to the company going global mulva worked carefully through successive positions at phillips to build the companys longterm security and assets this work called for an understanding of the global market and culture before many us companies in the sector had ventured outside the united states as vice president and treasurer of the europeafrica division of phillips from  to  mulva had to make critical oilrelated decisions about where to focus assets during a time when many oil companies were drilling in the middle east mulva avoided middle eastern oil purchases and concentrated instead on new finds in other world locations for example in  phillips began focusing on the first offshore oil field in china to begin oil production after becoming ceo of phillips in  mulva continued this trend to keep assets focused in the north sea venezuela asia north america kazakhstan and russia by concentrating on new markets in europe south america and asia mulva made a stable longterm investment that avoided acquisition of assets in volatile middle east reserves mulva did not completely avoid volatile markets in june  when russia began to privatize its oil industry mulva strongly pursued a  percent share of the russian oil company lukoil he believed that he would have the ability to make the companies more efficient and profitable and increase assets while stabilizing the russian economy although mulva felt that his plan would enhance the business and social climate in russia the longterm success of mulvas russian proposal was still unknown in the early s beyond purchasing assets in foreign markets mulva tried to pass on to his counterparts in foreign oil companies some of the knowledge he gained by entering the global market early in its development mulva focused on executives in foreign oil companies in such countries as russia and china by helping them train their management personnel handle new technology and cooperate with transnational companies not just gas although phillips petroleum corporation was not immediately associated with plastics production a large portion of the global industry mulva was working with in asia included production of polyethylene plastics made from natural gas liquids in  mulva assisted phillips in creating a joint venture agreement to produce polyethylene plastic in china by the time mulva became ceo in  phillips was also involved in the manufacture of polyolefin plastics and other chemicals new technology mulvas career in the petroleum industry spanned several technological changes in the way the industry obtained oil the landbased oil derricks in oklahoma discovered by the phillips brothers had been replaced by offshore drilling and creation of pipelines new refinery processes meant application of new technology and with it new regulations in the face of these changes mulva advocated creation of a federal system of regulations that refiners should accept because that is what their customers stakeholders and constituents are demanding oil daily march   in  mulva led conocophillips to join a us department of energy pilot project experimenting with the use of hydrogenbased transportation as part of the project conocophillips planned to equip several fueling stations with the ability to dispense liquid and gaseous hydrogen made from both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources although the hydrogenbased technology was in its infancy the project allowed conocophillips and the other members of the project team to evaluate hydrogens potential as a new transportation technology mulva recognized that to ensure longterm growth for the company conocophillips had to become a leader in the pursuit and implementation of cleaner energy sources mulva underlined his commitment to new sources of fuel by actively seeking out such projects as the us department of energy pilot project on hydrogenbased technology in addition to leading the industry in the examination of new technology mulva looked toward increased benefits for customers mulva and his team developed the conocophillips fleet card a credit card that can be used at conoco gas stations phillips  gas stations and  gas stations unlike other gas company cards it is accepted at many local maintenance facilities as well to assist clients with tracking and paying their bills online account management is available management style mulvas financial background allowed him to analyze new ideas and proposals carefully to examine the bottom line and effectively to predict the ideas longterm financial impact on the firm this methodical approach helped him create a strategic plan to meet and exceed corporate goals and decide which new technologies would be profitable mulva also maintained a level of transparency in his actions that emphasized his honesty in business as he frequently said if you dont have your health and your integrity you dont have much to offer conocophillips newsroom may   this transparency increased in importance in  when it was learned that energy executives at enron an interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline company also involved in trade of commodities had manipulated financial statements to create an illusion of success the discovery of the deception resulted in a financial crash that lost investors money and bankrupted the company after the enron scandal regulators took a close look at other energy companies and their executives mulvas policy of transparency and honesty protected phillips from suspicions of financial mismanagement in  mulvas peers acknowledged his leadership and ability in an increasingly difficult business environment by presenting to him the petroleum executive of the year award community outreach given phillipss global presence mulva felt that it was important to try to bring something other than jobs and oil to its operation locations primary among these goals was mulvas desire to ensure that the companys operations did not have an adverse impact on community health and safety this meant that proper safety measures had to be put in place to avoid increases in air water and land pollution as well as to protect the community from product spills also important to mulva was the concept of contributing to the communities in which phillipss employees worked phillips and later conocophillips supported business internship programs continued scholarship programs such as the phillips ers scholarship program and established the phillips petroleum endowed professorships and exchange fellowships environmental concerns in  mulva faced a tragic situation when a kresin chemical tank exploded at a phillips petroleum company chemical plant in pasadena the explosion killed one worker seriously burned four workers and injured  other employees the resulting fire also produced toxic fumes that spread over the surrounding neighborhoods the blast was especially worrisome because it was the third time in  years that an explosion had occurred at that plant in the wake of the disaster mulva had to answer accusations that phillipss attempts to cut costs had endangered their employees created an unsafe work environment and resulted in the large explosions to salvage phillipss reputation for safety and its concern for its workers mulva and phillips paid a large occupational safety and health administration osha fine for safety violations concentrated on improving plant safety and cooperated with investigators to help establish accountability for the explosions following the  exxon valdez incident in which approximately  million gallons of oil were spilled out of a damaged oil tanker off the coast of alaska worldwide public attention was focused on petroleum companies and their environmental records although mulvas time as ceo did not begin until five years after the spill the valdez s legacy and legislation were a constant concern that shaped the operations of the petroleum company as phillipss ceo mulva focused on the environmental impact of petroleum operations he was determined to learn how to increase phillipss holdings of oil through exploration and production without damaging the environment given the ability of most of phillipss products to cause environmental destruction if spilled mulva directed frequent safety inspections of production operations trained employees in safe practices and instituted more safety measures to ensure that an incident like the valdez accident would not occur careful acquisitions and mergers lead to profit as ceo of phillips mulva created a fiveyear strategic plan that used several mergers and acquisitions to make the company more competitive and increase oil exploration and production through increasing oil exploration and production phillips hoped to avoid being taken over by the huge companies resulting from the mergers of mediumsized businesses such as exxon and mobil and chevron and texaco in february  phillips joined its chemical and plastic operations with chevron to create the chevron phillips chemical company for phillips the plastics and chemical portion of the company began to decline in strategic importance as an asset as phillips focused on a new strategic plan for the oilandgas sector of the business and a series of explosions at phillips plants in  and  created public image problems through the spinoff and joint venture mulva helped create a global chemical production company with an excellent financial position more assets and enhanced growth prospects in april  mulva led phillips in the acquisition of the alaskan oilandgas production assets of the atlantic richfield company in an attempt to boost its upstream exploration and production the alaskan assets were sold to satisfy the terms of a legal settlement that resulted from the large bp amocoarco merger the assets augmented phillipss holdings in a nonvolatile location and increased the companys barrels of oil equivalence to  billion reserve barrels of oil and  thousand new barrels per day of production the  merger with the tosco corporation a refining marketing and transmission business helped phillips grow its refining business to become the second largest in the united states and the thirdlargest seller of motor gasoline in the united states phillips also added toscos large convenience store market and  gas stations to its lists of assets next came phillipss merger with conoco to become conocophilips nationally this merger moved the combined company to a position as the largest refiner in the united states and the thirdlargest energy company internationally the merger put conocophillips into position as the sixthlargest energy company in the world at the time mulva became ceo in  the companys assets were about  billion after the merger was completed in  the companys assets exceeded  billion mulva had learned more about large oil company mergers by watching carefully the successes and failures of the merger of mobil and exxon in  and chevron and texaco in  he chose a financial strategy that focused more on saving money and cutting capital spending than on growth in the first years the strategy produced enhanced financial returns and less debt for conocophillips by the end of the first quarter of  the company had an income of  billion and had come very close to paring its debt down to  percent of its capital see also entry on phillips petroleum company in international directory of company

stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
