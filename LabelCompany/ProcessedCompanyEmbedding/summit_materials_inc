managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition historical results may not be indicative of future performance forwardlooking statements reflect our current views about future events are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those discussed in the section entitled risk factors in the prospectus and any factors discussed in the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements and risk factors of this report this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes and other information included in this report overview we are one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the united states our materials include aggregates which we supply across the country with a focus on texas kansas kentucky utah and missouri and cement which we supply primarily in missouri iowa and along the mississippi river within our markets we offer customers a singlesource provider for construction materials and related downstream products through our vertical integration in addition to supplying aggregates to customers we use our materials internally to produce readymixed concrete and asphalt paving mix which may be sold externally or used in our paving and related services businesses our vertical integration creates opportunities to increase aggregates volumes optimize margin at each stage of production and provide customers with efficiency gains convenience and reliability which we believe gives us a competitive advantage we have completed  acquisitions which are organized into  operating companies that make up our three distinct operating segmentswest central and east regionsspanning  us states and british columbia canada and  metropolitan statistical areas our highly experienced management team led by our president and chief executive officer tom hill a year industry veteran has successfully enhanced the operations of acquired companies by focusing on scale advantages cost efficiencies and pricing discipline to improve profitability and cash flow as of june   we had  billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves serving our aggregates and cement businesses and operated over  sites and plants to which we believe we have adequate road barge andor railroad access from time to time in connection with certain acquisitions we engage a third party engineering firm to perform an aggregates reserves audit but we do not perform annual reserve audits table of contents including the davenport assets as defined below acquired in july  we operate and currently have assets in  us states and in british columbia canada the map below illustrates our geographic footprint image removed logo recent developments on august   we priced the offering of  shares of summit incs class a common stock at a price to the public of  per share the underwriters have been granted a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of class a common stock the offering is expected to close on august   subject to customary closing conditions summit inc intends to use all of the net proceeds from the offering to purchase for cash  newlyissued lp units from summit holdings and  outstanding lp units from certain preipo owners including affiliates of the sponsors and certain of our directors and officers summit holdings intends to use the proceeds it receives to pay all or a portion of the  million deferred purchase price of davenport assets on july   we acquired certain assets from lafarge including a cement plant a quarry and seven cement distribution terminals the davenport assets for a purchase price of  million in cash and a cement distribution terminal in bettendorf iowa we funded  million of the purchase price using proceeds from new senior notes and term debt issued by summit llc the remaining  million of the purchase price is due to lafarge no later than december   and accrues interest at an annual rate of  payable monthly on july   we issued  million in aggregate principal amount of  senior notes due july   the  notes collectively with the  notes senior notes the  notes were issued at  of their par value interest on the  notes is payable semiannually on january  and july  of each year commencing on january   on july   we refinanced our term loan under our senior secured credit facilities the refinancing the refinancing among other things i reduced the applicable margins used to calculate interest rates for term loans under our senior secured credit facilities to  for libor rate loans and  for base rate loans subject to a libor floor of  and one  basis point step down upon summit llc achieving a certain first lien net leverage ratio we used the net proceeds from the  notes and the refinancing to finance the initial  million cash purchase price for the davenport assets to refinance our existing senior secured term loan facility to redeem  million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding  notes and to pay related fees and expenses business trends and conditions the us construction materials industry is composed of four primary sectors table of contents typically range from small privatelyheld companies focused on a single material product or market to multinational companies that offer a wide array of construction materials products and related services we estimate that approximately  of the aggregates in the united states are held by private companies our revenue is derived from multiple enduse markets including private residential and nonresidential construction as well as public infrastructure construction residential and nonresidential construction consists of new construction and repair and remodel markets the construction sectors in the local economies in which we operate have begun to show signs of recovery however we could still be affected by any economic stagnation or decline which could vary by local region and market our sales and earnings are sensitive to national regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical changes in construction spending especially in the private sector from a macroeconomic view we see positive indicators for the construction sector including upward trends in housing starts construction employment and highway obligations all of these factors should result in increased construction activity in the private sector however we do not expect this recovery to be consistent across the united states certain of our markets are showing greater more rapid signs of recovery increased construction activity in the private sector could lead to increased public infrastructure spending in the relatively near future public infrastructure includes spending by federal state and local governments for roads highways bridges airports and other infrastructure projects public infrastructure projects have historically been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets our acquisitions to date have been primarily focused in states with certain constitutional protections for transportation funding sources which we believe limits our exposure to state and local budgetary uncertainties transportation infrastructure projects driven by both federal and state funding programs represent a significant share of the us construction materials market federal funds are allocated to the states which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the federal highway trust fund which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel gasoline and other user fees the dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs funding for the existing federal transportation funding program expired on september   and on august   a highway trust fund extension bill was enacted this bill provides funding that is expected to last through july  on july   congress passed a bill to extend funding through october   this bill also included provisions to raise approximately  billion in revenue to fund the program through the october  extension any additional funding or successor programs have yet to be approved with the nations infrastructure aging we expect us infrastructure spending to grow over the long term and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any such increase in addition to federal funding highway construction and maintenance funding is also available through state county and local agencies our five largest states by revenue texas kansas kentucky utah and missouri which represented approximately     and  respectively of our total revenue in  each have funds whose revenue sources have certain constitutional protections and are dedicated for transportation projects texas department of transportations budget from  to  is  billion kansas has a year  billion highway bill that was passed in may  kentuckys biennial highway construction plan has funding of  billion from july  to june  utahs transportation investment fund has  billion committed through  missouri has an estimated  billion in annual construction funding committed to essential road and bridge programs through  within many of our markets state and local governments have taken actions to maintain or grow highway funding during a time of uncertainty with respect to federal funding for example on november   voters in texas passed a proposition that will provide  billion of incremental funding annually to the texas department of transportation the funds must be used for construction maintenance rehabilitation and acquiring rightofway for public roads the texas legislature recently passed the largest twoyear budget in the history of the texas department of transportation with growth in both new construction and maintenance in addition increased energy sector activity in parts of texas has driven an increase in private construction demand which we expect to continue in particular houston and austin texas have seen rapid residential demand expansion which we expect to provide a stimulus for nonresidential and public infrastructure demand as job growth has drawn new residents increases in heavy truck registration fees dedicated sales tax revenue and bond issuances have enabled kansas to maintain stability in public infrastructure spending we believe that public infrastructure spending in kentucky which comprises the majority of our revenue in the state will remain consistent in the upcoming years we expect primarily maintenancerelated public demand in utah and missouri both of which have recently completed large spending programs table of contents use and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality nearly all of the products used by us and by our customers in the private construction or public infrastructure industries are used outdoors our highway operations and production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors therefore seasonal changes and other weatherrelated conditions in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes tropical storms and heavy snows can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services in addition construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry which typically occurs in the spring summer and fall warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates cement readymixed concrete and asphalt paving mix production natural gas for hot mix asphalt production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production related mobile equipment liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our private and commercial contracts limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity we often obtain similar escalators on public infrastructure contracts in addition we enter into various firm purchase commitments with terms generally less than one year for certain raw materials as a result of the contract escalation clauses and effective use of the firm purchase commitments commodity prices did not have a material effect on our results of operations in the three and six months ended june   as compared to the three and six months ended june   backlog our products are generally delivered upon receipt of orders or requests from customers or shortly thereafter accordingly the backlog associated with product sales is converted into revenue within a relatively short period of time inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers therefore a period over period increase or decrease of backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of our business our backlog includes only those products and projects for which we have obtained a purchase order or a signed contract with the customer and does not include products purchased and sold or services awarded and provided within the period our paving and related services backlog represents our estimate of revenue that will be realized under the applicable contracts we generally include a project in backlog at the time it is awarded and funding is in place many of our paving and related services are awarded and completed within one year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or ending contract backlog historically we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications however subject to applicable contract terms substantially all contracts in our backlog may be cancelled or modified by our customers as a verticallyintegrated business approximately  of our aggregates sales volume was further processed and sold as a downstream product such as readymixed concrete or asphalt paving mix or used in our paving and related services business and approximately  of the asphalt paving mix we sold was installed by our own paving crews during the six months ended june   the following table sets forth our backlog as of the indicated dates june  june  in thousands   aggregate in tons   asphalt in tons   readymixed concrete in cubic yards   construction services       the dollar value of the construction services backlog includes the value of the aggregate and asphalt tons and readymixed concrete cubic yards in backlog that are expected to be sourced internally financial highlights the principal factors in evaluating our financial condition and operating results for the three and six months ended june   as compared to june   are net revenue increased  million and  million in the three and six months ended june   respectively as a result of pricing and volume increases across our product lines which includes volume contributions from our acquisitions table of contents in march  we completed an ipo of summit incs class a common stock the proceeds of which were used i to redeem  million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding  notes at a redemption price of  and an applicable premium thereon ii to purchase a portion of the noncontrolling interests of continental cement iii to pay a onetime fee of  million in connection with the termination of a transaction and management fee agreement and iv for general corporate purposes the redemption of the  notes occurred in april  acquisitions in addition to our organic growth we continued to grow our business through

we use to evaluate the performance of our business from both a consolidated and operating segment perspective operating income and margins are discussed in terms of changes in volume pricing and mix of revenue source ie type of product sales or service revenue we focus on operating margin which we define as operating income as a percentage of revenue as a key metric when assessing the performance of the business as we believe that analyzing changes in costs in relation to changes in revenue provides more meaningful insight into the results of operations than examining costs in isolation table of contents operating income loss reflects our profit loss from continuing operations after taking into consideration cost of revenue general and administrative expenses depreciation depletion amortization and accretion and transaction costs cost of revenue generally increases ratably with revenue as labor transportation costs and subcontractor costs are recorded in cost of revenue general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue vary throughout the year due to the seasonality of our business as a result of our revenue growth occurring primarily through acquisitions general and administrative costs and depreciation depletion amortization and accretion have historically grown ratably with revenue however as volumes increase we expect these costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease our transaction costs fluctuate with the number and size of acquisitions completed each year the table below includes revenue and operating income loss by segment for the three and six months ended june   and june   three months ended six months ended june   june   june   june   operating operating operating operating in thousands revenue income loss revenue income loss revenue

expenses for employees included in the companys headquarters and in the six months ended june    million of costs associated with the march  ipo nongaap performance measures the performance of our segments is evaluated based on several factors including a measure we call adjusted ebitda by segment we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes interest expense depreciation depletion amortization and accretion loss on debt financings ipo costs stock compensation costs and transaction costs adjusted ebitda is determined before considering the loss from discontinued operations loss on debt financings and ipo costs as these amounts are not viewed by management as part of our core business when assessing the performance of our segments or allocation of resources accretion expense is recognized on our asset retirement obligations and reflects the time value of money given that accretion is similar in nature to interest expense it is treated consistently with interest expense and is excluded from adjusted ebitda we also evaluate the performance of our business based on a metric we call gross profit which we define as operating income loss before general and administrative expenses depreciation depletion amortization and accretion and transaction costs adjusted ebitda and gross profit are used by the chief operating decision maker along with other factors to allocate resources these measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that when viewed with our results determined in accordance with us gaap and the accompanying reconciliations to us gaap financial measures included in the tables below may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business however they should not be construed as being more important than other comparable us gaap measures and must be considered in conjunction with the us gaap measures in addition nongaap financial measures are not standardized therefore it may not be possible to compare such financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated interim financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure table of contents the tables below reconcile our net income loss to adjusted ebitda

securities and exchange commission “sec” regulates the use of “nongaap financial measures” such as adjusted eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin gross profit free cash flow and net leverage which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” we have provided these measures because among other things we believe that they provide investors with additional information to measure our performance evaluate our ability to service our debt and evaluate certain flexibility under our restrictive covenants our adjusted net income adjusted eps adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and gross profit may vary from the use of such terms by others and should not be considered as alternatives to or more important than net income loss operating income loss revenue or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap as measures of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidityadjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and other nongaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap some of the limitations of adjusted ebitda are that these measures do not reflect i our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments ii changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs iii interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debt and iv income tax payments we are required to make because of these limitations we rely primarily on our us gaap results and use adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and other nongaap measures on a supplemental basisadjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin gross profit adjusted net income loss adjusted eps and free cash flow reflect additional ways of viewing aspects of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to us gaap financial measures included in the tables attached to this press release may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measurereconciliations of the nongaap measures used in this press release are included in the attached tables because gaap financial measures on a forwardlooking basis are not accessible and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort we have not provided reconciliations for forwardlooking nongaap measures for the same reasons we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information which could be material to future resultscautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statementsthis press release contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws which involve risks and uncertainties forwardlooking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and you can identify forwardlooking statements because they contain words such as “believes” “expects” “may” “will” “should” “seeks” “intends” “trends” “plans” “estimates” “projects” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that concern our strategy plans expectations or intentions any and all statements made relating to the expectations for our anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions the macroeconomic outlook for our markets potential acquisition activity our estimated and projected earnings margins costs expenditures cash flows sales volumes and financial results are forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time and therefore our actual results may differ materially from those expected we derive many of our forwardlooking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon many detailed assumptions while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and of course it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual resultsin light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved important factors could affect our results and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in our forwardlooking statements including but not
