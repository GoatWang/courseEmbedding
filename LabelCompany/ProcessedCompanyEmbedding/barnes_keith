would just plain be a heck of a lot of fun to boot so why not have a hog hunting contest between wellknown industry folks andor celebrities and make sure the event is broadcasted to the bow hunting world with tv shows and social media being the conduit think about it hogs are the perfect quarry for such an event they are ridiculously plentiful in texas the ranchers typically want you to harvest as many as possible there are no seasons and no limits need more they provide excellent lean organic meat and there are needy families everywhere that will gladly accept donations of the meat on top of all of that they are a bowhunter’s dream absolutely a blast to hunt that was whyhow the boss hog contest was created the only missing pieces were the ranch and of course contestants we asked around and it was impressive to say the least how often the barneskeith ranch near san saba texas was recommended we contacted owner bob keith and he was very receptive to the idea upon inspection it was clear that we had found the perfect ranch the ranch consists of twelve thousand rolling hill large oak tree covered acres with  miles of the colorado river as one border it’s no surprise that there are deer turkeys exotics and hogs everywhere the game population is incredible the barnes keith ranch is truly a worldclass ranch both in terms of beauty and hunting potential now we had our event – the ultimate predatorbarnes keith ranch – boss hog contest was born all we needed was the ideal mix of contestants talking these folks into taking part in this event was really easy we provided the ranch guides lodging food and entertainment  and all they had to do was use our products bring a cameraman and shamelessly promote the barneskeith ranch and ultimate predator to the fullest extent possible utilizing their various channels brian keith john sarkinsian jr brady ellisonthe gangbarnes keith guidesrick forrestlincoln tapthe contestants yard contestbrady ellisonquickly we assembled such notables as tom miranda the adventure bowhunter territories wild jack frost first ever to harvest a grand slam of north american wild sheep lincoln tapp young wild julie mcqueendaniel lee martin till death do us part brady ellison three time olympic medalist and cole van winkle arizona extreme archeryrick forrest schwacker broadhead founder scoring will be based on both total number of hogs harvested and total weight both scores will be tallied each scoring period during each scoring period each team’s score will be broken into two categories the first is total weight harvested and the second is total  of hogs harvested there are  teams competing the team with the highest total number of hogs harvested in each period will receive  points the team with the highest total weight of hogs harvested will also receive  points second place will receive  points third place  points fourth place  points and so on if any team fails to harvest a hog during a scoring period they will receive double zeros ties will split the allocated points the team with the highest point total at the end of the six scoring periods will have the dubious honor of being crowned  ultimate predator barnes keith ranch boss hog world champion guides stayed in their assigned area the entire  days and hunters rotated every half day so all hunted each area we also provided a hog caller for each hunter one half day which provided a lot of additional excitement kudos to glenn guess of hog zombies for his expert game calling and convergent hunting solutions for providing outstanding game calls for the hunt they were a great addition to the event all hunting was done by spot and stalk and bow only every hunter had numerous stalks each scoring period and by the end of the  day contest each hunter had multiple harvests i promised not to tell but also numerous misses yes including olympic champion and current indoor and outdoor world champion brady ellison the only thing i ask is that you don’t let this get out to those pesky koreans… i think they think he never misses anything lincoln tapp ended up in the honey hole the first afternoon and harvested  hogs he showed up in camp early in the afternoon when i asked him what he was doing there he said he had run out of arrows that is exactly what we were hoping to hear the teams all jockeyed for the lead over the next couple of days and by the last scoring period it had come down to a virtual dead heat between team ellison and team van winkle cole and rick made it back to camp first and they had harvested two hogs totaling  pounds brady showed up shortly and likewise had  hogs in the back of the truck the first one weighed in at  pounds leaving the final hog weighed to determine the  boss hog contest champion the crowd was silent not really but it makes for good press as the last hog was hung up on the scale and it read out  pounds and brady ellison was crowned literally the champion……something he has quite a bit of experience with our inaugural contest was a success our inaugural ultimate predatorbarnes keith ranch boss hog contest was a resounding success six teams with only one hunter hunting at a time harvested  hogs in  days to make that even better danny bezet with christian bowhunters of texas graciously offered to cover the cost of having all useable meat processed at a local processing plant and the total organic lean meat distributed to local needy families totaled approximately  pounds or enough to provide about  meals what a wonderful culmination to an incredible event our thanks to danny and the christian bowhunters of texas what a classy group of folks we also want to give special thanks to the guides on the barneskeith hunting manager jose ranch manager robert ranch owners bob and brian and chris and jeremy did an outstanding job of taking care of the hunters a very special thanks goes out to bob keith owner of the barneskeith ranch without his unselfish support and guidance this event would not have happened i can’t imagine that we could have possibly found a more spectacular ranch in texas to host this event i can guarantee there is not a finer group of owners and crew anywhere  we at ultimate predator greatly appreciate the dedication and support of all you folks and look forward to crowning the 0 boss hog champion next year contacts barnes keith ranch bob

their musical era a grand group portraitspellbinding storytellingrichard corliss time the huffington post why does keith want to undercut his legend because he has much better stories to tell and in life the page memoir he wrote with james fox he serves them up like his guitar riffsin your face nasty confrontational rich smart and in the end unforgettablehis story slows as it approaches the present and you start to wonder if this peter pan life can get to its end without real pain and you think well theres another side to this  if mick started writing tonight he could have his book out before hes 0 but mostly you wish you could go back to the beginning of life and start again lou bayard after half a century on the road richards has the face he deservesbut not it appears the brain against all pharmaceutical odds he has held on to a substantial portion of his own history and has turned it into the most scabrously honest and essential rock memoir in a long time…in some cases richardss memories are supplemented by others on every page they are shaped by cowriter james fox but the voice that emerges is unmistakably the dark lords growly and profane and black with comedy and for all that surprisingly charming…the washington post liz phair the most impressive part of life is the wealth of knowledge keith shares whether hes telling you how to layer an acoustic guitar until it sounds electric…or how to win a knife fight he delivers recipe after recipe for everything rock n roll and let me say its quite an education…james fox keiths coauthor deserves a lot of credit for editing organizing and elegantly stepping out of the way of keiths remembrances reading life is like getting to corner keith richards in a room and ask him every­thing you ever wanted to know about the rolling stones and have him be completely honest with youthe new york times book review the publishers bio of the author reads keith richards was born in england in  and founded the rolling stones with mick jagger in  he lives in connecticut in the terselytitled life keith himself fills in all the tantalizing gaps in that précis that this longdiscussed autobiography has been wildly anticipated should surprise no serious rock watcher over the decades richards life lifestyle and relationships with other band members have spawned proliferating rumors the archetypal exile on main street finally speaks his mind sometimes you can get what you want a barnes  noble bestseller now in a paperback and nookbook publishers weekly johnny depp and joe hurley capture richardss rock n roll spirit in a wise charming and textured narration of the famed guitarists memoir tracing richardss trajectory from boyhood in england through the formation of the stones to the bands rise to world domination this audiobook is chockfull of frank revelations and enlightening stories behind the music the three readers do superb turns—but the seemingly arbitrary switches between them can be jarring and confusing depps narration is steady wellpaced clear and grounded he produces a delicious range of voices for dialogue most notably a drunk judge in arkansas and richards himself sounds a bit like an elderly bluesy jack sparrow hurley captures the voice of richards throughout narrating in a gritty growl that is spoton and sections read by richards are a real treat his raspy voice is unmistakable and haunting a little brown hardcover oct library journal this reviewer came of age wondering if richards was even born innocent soon after cracking the spine of his deservedly lauded memoirs there is an answer yes and although the rolling stones guitarist made great haste toward his iconic junkiedom he lived much life to the marrow before and after readers need not read so much as listen—richards recounts the choicest milestones in a voice that is so evocative of his many sides you will hear every sigh howl growl and snicker prepare as well to be surprised the tales of excess do not include groupie collecting richards was and is a onewoman man and when hes plunging us into the darkest years of his addiction revolt will surface in tidal waves but also understanding richards explains better than any rock star of his generation that the drug taking was not for escaping pain but relishing every rarefied moment of his artistic prime he and soul mates like gram parsons were committed to breathing and recording music with the force of giants come hell or mexican shoe scrapingsverdict against all odds richards survived his own vitality and rebelliousness and he knows it lovers of music travel autobiography and fiction will eat the lessons of this naturalborn pirate with a knife fork and spoon see prepub alert lj 0—heather mccormack library journal rolling stone life is one of the greatest rock memoirs ever kirkus reviews the dread pirate richards scourge of straight society and rock icon bares all—including a fang or twothe rolling stones rhythm guitarist—and we learn principal songwriter—richards has already set tongues wagging giant red ones or otherwise with leaked bits and pieces of his memoir most notably the extensive extremely bitchy complaints about mick jagger i used to love to hang with mick he writes but i havent gone to his dressing room in i dont think twenty years sometimes i miss my friend where the hell did he go his fellow glimmer twin may not miss him so much upon learning richardss assessment of his soul and genitalia he also tears down another mick this one mick taylor former stones guitarist who left the band without keiths permission you can leave in a coffin or with dispensations for long service but otherwise you cant others receive gentler treatment among them gram parsons rolling stones heart and soul ian stewart and keyboard wizard billy preston who we learn was gay at a time when nobody could be openly gay surveying the living and the dead richards admits the improbability of his own survival though he notes most of his excessive behavior is now many decades past he is much calmer now particularly after having undergone brain surgery a few years ago which does not mean hes surrendering—part of the joy of this altogether enjoyable if sometimes meanspirited book is the damnthetorpedoes take on things indeed when hes not slagging or praising richards provides useful life pointers from how to keep several packs of dogs in different places to the virtues of open guitar tunings he even turns in a creditable recipe for bangers and mash complete with a pointed tale that speaks to why you would not want to make off with his spring onions while hes in the middle of cookinga jury of my peers would be jimmy page a conglomeration of musicians guys that have been on the road and know whats what richards

by police officers in arkansas during our  us tour and a standoff ensues why did we stop at the dice restaurant in fordyce arkansas for lunch on independence day weekend on any day despite everything i knew from ten years of driving through the bible belt tiny town of fordyce rolling stones on the police menu across the united states every copper wanted to bust us by any means available to get promoted and patriotically rid america of these little fairy englishmen it was  a time of brutality and confrontation open season on the stones had been declared since our last tour the tour of ’ known as the stp the state department had noted riots true civil disobedience also true illicit sex whatever that is and violence across the united states all the fault of us mere minstrels we had been inciting youth to rebellion we were corrupting america and they had ruled never to let us travel in the united states again it had become in the time of nixon a serious political matter he had personally deployed his dogs and dirty tricks against john lennon who he thought might cost him an election we in turn they told our lawyer officially were the most dangerous rockandroll band in the worldin previous days our great lawyer bill carter had singlehandedly slipped us out of major confrontations devised and sprung by the police forces of memphis and san antonio and now fordyce small town of  whose school emblem was some weird red bug might be the one to take the prize carter had warned us not to drive through arkansas at all and certainly never to stray from the interstate he pointed out that the state of arkansas had recently tried to draw up legislation to outlaw rock and roll love to see the wording of the statute—“where there be loudly and insistently four beats to the bar…” and here we were driving back roads in a brandnew yellow chevrolet impala in the whole of the united states there was perhaps no sillier place to stop with a car loaded with drugs—a conservative redneck southern community not happy to welcome differentlooking strangersin the car with me were ronnie wood freddie sessler an incredible character my friend and almost a father to me who will have many parts in this story and jim callaghan the head of our security for many years we were driving the four hundred miles from memphis to dallas where we had our next gig the following day at the cotton bowl jim dickinson the southern boy who played piano on “wild horses” had told us that the texarkana landscape was worth the car ride and we were planed out we’d had a scary flight from washington to memphis dropping suddenly many thousands of feet with much sobbing and screaming the photographer annie leibovitz hitting her head on the roof and the passengers kissing the tarmac when we landed i was seen going to the back of the plane and consuming substances with more than usual dedication as we tossed about the skies not wanting to waste a bad one in bobby sherman’s old plane the starshipso we drove and ronnie and i had been particularly stupid we pulled into this roadhouse called the dice where we sat down and ordered and then ronnie and i went to the john you know just start me up we got high we didn’t fancy the clientele out there or the food and so we hung in the john laughing and carrying on we sat there for forty minutes and you don’t do that down there not then that’s what excited and exacerbated the situation and the staff called the cops as we pulled out there was a black car parked on the side no number plate and the minute we took off twenty yards down the road we get sirens and the little blinking light and there they are with shotguns in our facesi had a denim cap with all these pockets in it that were filled with dope everything was filled with dope in the car doors themselves all you had to do was pop the panels and there were plastic bags full of coke and grass peyote and mescaline oh my god how are we going to get out of this it was the worst time to get busted it was a miracle we had been allowed into the states at all for this tour our visas hung on a thread of conditions as every police force in the big cities also knew and had been fixed by bill carter with very hard longdistance footwork with the state department and the immigration service over the previous two years it was obviously condition zero that we weren’t arrested for possession of narcotics and carter was responsible for guaranteeing thisi wasn’t taking the heavy shit at the time i’d cleaned up for the tour and i could have just put all of that stuff on the plane to this day i cannot understand why i bothered to carry all that crap around and take that chance people had given me all this gear in memphis and i was loath to give it away but i still could have put it on the plane and driven clean why did i load the car like some pretend dealer maybe i woke up too late for the plane i know i spent a long time opening up the panels stashing this shit but peyote is not particularly my line of substances anywayin the cap’s pockets there’s hash tuinals some coke i greet the police with a flourish of the cap and throw pills and hash into the bushes “hello officer” flourish “oh have i broken some local law pray forgive me i’m english was i driving on the wrong side of the road” and you’ve already got them on the back foot and you’ve got rid of your crap but only some of it they saw a hunting knife lying on the seat and would later decide to take that as evidence of a “concealed weapon” the lying bastards and then they made us follow them to a car park somewhere beneath city hall as we drove they watched us surely throwing more of our shit into the roadthey didn’t do a search immediately when we got to the garage they said to ronnie “ok you go into the car and bring out your stuff” ronnie had a little handbag or something in the car but at the same time he tipped all the crap he had into a kleenex box and as he got out he said to me “it’s under the driver’s seat” and when i go in i didn’t have anything in the car to get all i’ve got to do is pretend that i have something and take care of this box but i didn’t know what the fuck to do with it so basically i just scrunched it up a bit and i put it under the backseat and i walked out and said well i don’t have anything the fact that they didn’t tear the car apart is beyond meby now they know who they’ve got “weeeell looky here we got some live ones” but then they suddenly didn’t seem to know what to do with these international stars stuck in their custody now they had to draft in forces from all over the state nor did they seem to know what to charge us with they also knew we were trying to locate bill carter and this must have intimidated them because this was bill carter’s front lawn he had grown up in the nearby town of rector and he knew every state law enforcement officer every sheriff every prosecuting attorney all the political leaders they may have started to regret that they’d tipped off the wire services to their catch the national news media were gathering outside the courthouse—one dallas tv station had hired a learjet to get pole position on the story it was saturday afternoon and they were making calls to little rock to get advice from state officials so instead of locking us up and having that image broadcast to the world they kept us in loose “protective custody” in the police chief’s office which meant we could walk about a bit where was carter offices shut during the holiday no cell phones then it was taking some time to locate himin the meantime we’re trying to get rid of all this stuff we’re festooned in the ’0s i was flying high as a kite on pure pure merck cocaine the fluffy pharmaceutical blow freddie sessler and i went to the john we weren’t even escorted down there “jesuschrist” the phrase that preceded everything with freddie “i’m loaded” he’s got bottles full of tuinal and he’s so nervous about flushing them down that he loses the bottle and all the fucking turquoiseandred pills are rolling everywhere and meanwhile he’s trying to flush down coke i popped the hash down and the weed flushed it the fucking thing won’t flush there’s too much weed i’m flushing and flushing and then suddenly these pills come rolling there under the cubicle and i’m trying to pick ’em up and fling ’em in and everything but i can’t because there’s another cubicle in between the one freddie’s in and the one i’m in so there’s fifty pills lying stranded on the floor in the middle cubicle “jesuschrist keith” “keep your cool freddie i’ve got all the ones out of mine have you got all the ones out of yours” “i think so i think so” “ok let’s go in the middle one and get rid of them” it was just raining with fucking shit it was unbelievable every pocket or place you looked… i never knew i had that much coke in my lifethe sleeper was freddie’s briefcase which was in the trunk of the car as yet unopened and we knew he had cocaine in there they couldn’t fail to find it freddie and i decided we should disown freddie strategically for that afternoon and say he was a hitchhiker but one to whom we were happy to extend the powers of our legal adviser if need be when he finally appeared on the scenewhere was carter it took some time to marshal our forces while the population of fordyce was swelling to riotsize proportions people from mississippi texas tennessee—all coming in to watch the fun nothing would happen until carter was located and he was on the tour he wasn’t far away just having a deserved day off so there was time to reflect how i had dropped my guard and forgotten the rules don’t break the law and get pulled over cops everywhere and certainly in the south have a whole range of quasilegal tricks to bust you if they feel like it and they could put you away for ninety days then no problem that’s why carter told us to stick to the interstate the bible belt was a lot tighter in those dayswe did many miles on the ground in those early tours roadhouses were always an interesting gamble and you better get ready for it—and be ready for it you try going to a truck stop in  or ’ or ’ down south or in texas it felt much more dangerous than anything in the city you’d walk in and there’s the good ol’ boys and slowly you realize that you’re not going to have a very comfortable meal in there with these truckers with crew cuts and tattoos you nervously peck away—“oh i’ll have that to go please” they’d call us girls because of the long hair “how you doing girls dance with me” hair… the little things that you wouldn’t think about that changed whole cultures the way they reacted to our looks in certain parts of london then was not much different from the way they reacted to us in the south “hello darling” and all that shitwhen you look back it was relentless confrontation but you’re not thinking about it at the time first off these were all new experiences and you were really not aware of the effects it might or might not have on you you were gradually growing into it i just found in those situations that if they saw the guitars and knew you were musicians then suddenly it was totally ok better take a guitar into a truck stop “can you pick that thing son” sometimes we’d actually do it pull out the guitars sing for our supperbut then all you had to do was cross the tracks and you’d get a real education if we were playing with black musicians they’d look after us it was “hey you wanna get laid tonight she’ll love you she ain’t seen anything like you before” you got welcomed you got fed and you got laid the white side of town was dead but it was rockin’ across the tracks long as you knew cats you was cool an incredible educationsometimes we’d do two or three shows a day they wouldn’t be long shows you’d be doing twenty minutes half an hour three times a day waiting for the rotation because these were mostly revue shows black acts amateurs local white hits whatever and if you went down south it was just endless towns and states just went by it’s called whiteline fever if you’re awake you stare at the white lines down the middle of the road and every now and again somebody says “i need a crap” or “i’m hungry” then you walked into these brief bits of theater behind the road these are minor roads in the carolinas mississippi and stuff you get out dying for a leak you see “men’s” and some black bloke is standing there saying “coloreds only” and you think “i’m being discriminated against” you’d drive by these little juke joints and there’s this incredible music pumping out and steam coming out the window“hey let’s pull over here”“could be dangerous”“no come on listen to that shit”and there’d be a band a trio playing big black fuckers and some bitches dancing around with dollar bills in their thongs and then you’d walk in and for a moment there’s almost a chill because you’re the first white people they’ve seen in there and they know that the energy’s too great for a few white blokes to really make that much difference especially as we don’t look like locals and they get very intrigued and we get really into being there but then we got to get back on the road oh shit i could’ve stayed here for days you’ve got to pull out again lovely black ladies squeezing you between their huge tits you walk out and there’s sweat all over you and perfume and we all get in the car smelling good and the music drifts off in the background i think some of us had died and gone to heaven because a year before we were plugging london clubs and we’re doing all right but actually in the next year we’re somewhere we thought we’d never be we were in mississippi we’d been playing this music and it had all been very respectful but then we were actually there sniffing it you want to be a blues player the next minute you fucking well are and you’re stuck right amongst them and there’s muddy waters standing next to you it happens so fast that you really can’t register all of the impressions that are coming at you it comes later on the flashbacks because it’s all so much it’s one thing to play a muddy waters song it’s another thing to play with himbill carter was finally tracked down to little rock where he was having a barbecue at the house of a friend of his who happened to be a judge a very useful coincidence he would hire a plane and be there in a couple of hours bringing the judge with him carter’s judge friend knew the state policeman who was going to search the car told him that he thought the police had no right to do it and warned him to hold off a search until he got there everything froze for two more hoursbill carter had grown up working on the local political campaigns from when he was in college so he knew almost everybody of importance in the state and people he had worked for in arkansas had now become some of the most powerful democrats in washington his mentor was wilbur mills from kensett chairman of the house ways and means committee second most powerful man after the president carter came from a poor background joined the air force at the time of korea paid for law studies with his gi money until it ran out when he joined the secret service and ended up guarding kennedy he wasn’t in dallas that day—he was on a training course—but he’d been everywhere with kennedy planned his trips and knew all the key officials in every state kennedy had visited he was close to the center after kennedy’s death he was an investigator on the warren commission and then started his own law practice in little rock becoming a kind of people’s lawyer he had a lot of balls he was passionate about the rule of law the correct way of doing things the constitution—and he taught police seminars on it he’d gone into the defense attorney business he told me because he’d got fed up with policemen routinely abusing their power and bending the law which meant almost all of them he encountered on tour with the rolling stones in almost every city carter was our natural allyhis old contacts in washington had been his ace card when we were refused visas to tour in the united states in  what carter found when he first went to washington on our behalf late that year was that the nixon dictum prevailed and ran through the bureaucracy down to the lowest level he was told officially that the stones would never tour in the united states again apart from our being the most dangerous rockandroll band in the world inciting riots purveying gross misconduct and contempt for the law there was widespread anger that mick had appeared on stage dressed as uncle sam wearing the stars and stripes that by itself was enough to refuse him entry it was bunting you had to guard yourself against being attacked from that area brian jones got pulled in because he picked up an american flag that was lying around backstage in the mid’0s in syracuse new york i think it was he put it over his shoulder but a corner of it touched the ground this was after the show and we were making our way back and the police escort barged us all into an office and started screaming “dragging the flag on the ground you’re demeaning my nation an act of sedition”then there was my record—no getting away from it it was also widely known—what else did the press write about me—that i had a heroin addiction i’d just had a conviction in the uk for possession of drugs in october  and i had been convicted of possession in france in  watergate was heating up when carter began his campaign—some of nixon’s henchmen had been jailed and nixon was soon to fall along with haldeman mitchell and the rest—some of whom had been involved personally with the fbi in the underhanded campaign against john lennoncarter’s advantage at the immigration department was that he was one of the boys he came from law enforcement he had respect for having been with kennedy he did an “i know how you boys feel” and just said he wanted a hearing because he didn’t think we were being treated fairly he worked his way in many months of slogging he paid attention particularly to the lowerlevel staff who he knew could obstruct things on technicalities i underwent medical tests to prove that i was drug free from the same doctor in paris who had given me many a clean bill of health then nixon resigned and then carter asked the top official to meet mick and judge for himself and of course mick puts on his suit and charms the pants off him mick is really the most versatile bloke why i love him he can hold a philosophical discussion with sartre in his native tongue mick’s very good with the locals carter told me he applied for the visas not in new york or washington but in memphis where it was quieter the result was an astonishing turnaround waivers and visas were suddenly issued on one condition that bill carter toured with the stones and would personally assure the government that riots would be prevented and that there would be no illegal activities on the tour they required a doctor to accompany us—an almost fictional character who appears later in the narrative who became a tour victim sampling the medication and running off with a groupiecarter had reassured them by offering to run the tour secret service–style alongside the police his other contacts also meant that he would get a tipoff if the police were planning a bust and that’s what saved our asses on many occasionsthings had hardened up since the  tour with all the demonstrations and antiwar marches and the nixon period the first evidence of this was in san antonio on june  this was the tour of the giant inflatable cock it came rising up from the stage as mick sang “starfucker” it was great was the cock though we paid for it later in mick’s wanting props at every tour after that to cover his insecurities there was a huge business of getting elephants on stage in memphis until they ended up crashing through ramps and shitting all over the stage in rehearsals and were abandoned we never had a problem with the cock in our opening shows at baton rouge but the cock was a lure to the coppers who had given up trying to bust us in the hotel or while we were traveling or in the dressing room the only place they could get us was on stage they threatened to arrest mick if the cock rose that night and there was a mighty standoff carter warned them that the kids would burn down the arena he’d taken the temperature and realized the kids weren’t going to stand for it in the end mick decided to defer to the sentiments of the authorities and it didn’t erect itself in san antonio in memphis when they threatened to arrest mick for singing the lyrics “starfucker starfucker” carter stopped them in their tracks by producing a playlist from the local radio station that showed they’d been playing it on the air without any protest for two years what carter saw and was determined to fight every inch of the way was that every time the police moved in every city they violated the law acted illegally tried to bust in without warrants made searches without probable causeso there was some form on the books already by the time carter finally got to fordyce with the judge under his arm a great press corps was established in town roadblocks had been erected to stop more people coming in what the police wanted to do was to open the trunk where they were sure they would find drugs first they charged me with reckless driving because my tires had squealed and kicked up gravel as i left the restaurant car park twenty yards of reckless driving charge two i had a “concealed weapon” the hunting knife but to open the trunk legally they needed to show “probable cause” meaning there had to be some evidence or reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed otherwise the search is illegal and even if they find the stuff the case will be thrown out they could have opened the trunk if they’d seen contraband when they looked through the car window but they hadn’t seen anything this “probable cause” business was what generated the shouting matches that frequently erupted now between the various officials as the afternoon wore on first off carter made it clear that he saw a trumpedup charge to invent a probable cause the cop who stopped me said that he smelled marijuana smoke coming through the windows as we left the car park and this was their cue to open the trunk “they must think i fell off a watermelon truck” carter told us the cops were trying to say that in the minute between leaving the restaurant and driving out of the car park there was time to light up a spliff and fill the car with enough smoke that it could be smelled many yards away this was why they had arrested us they said that alone destroyed the credibility of the police evidence carter discussed all this with an already enraged chief of police whose town was under siege but who knew he could stop our soldout concert the following night at the cotton bowl in dallas by keeping us in fordyce in chief bill gober carter saw and we saw the archetype redneck cop the bible belt version of my friends from chelsea police station always prepared to bend the law and abuse their powers gober was a man personally enraged by the rolling stones—their dress their hair what they stood for their music and above all their challenge to authority as he saw it disobedience even elvis said “yes sir” not these longhaired punks so gober went ahead and opened the trunk warned by carter that he would challenge him all the way to the supreme court and when the trunk was opened that was the real creamer it was legsintheair laughterwhen you crossed the river from tennessee then mostly a dry state into west memphis which is in arkansas there were liquor stores selling what was basically moonshine with brown paper labels ronnie and i had gone berserk in one of them buying every bizarre bottle of bourbon with a great label flying cock fighting cock the grey major little hip flasks with all of these exotic handwritten labels on them we had sixtyodd in the trunk so now we were suddenly suspected of being bootleggers “no we bought them we paid for them” so i think all of that booze confused them this is the ’0s and boozers are not dopeheads in those days there was that separation “at least they’re men and drink whiskey” then they found freddie’s briefcase which was locked and he told them he’d forgotten the combination so they smacked it open and there sure enough were two small containers of pharmaceutical cocaine gober thought he had us or at least he had freddie coldit took some time to find the judge now late in the evening and when he arrived he’d been out on the golf course all day drinking and by this time he was flyingnow we have total comedy absurdity keystone kops as the judge takes to his bench and the various lawyers and cops try to get him to follow their versions of the law what gober wanted to do was to get the judge to rule that the search and the finding of the coke were legal and that all of us would be detained on felony charges—ie put in the slammer on this little point of law arguably hung the future of the rolling stones in america at leastwhat then happened is pretty much as follows from what i overheard and from bill carter’s later testimony and this is the quickest way to tell it with apologies to perry masonthe castbill gober police chief vindictive enragedjudge wynne presiding judge in fordyce very drunkfrank wynne

legal cause to hold them we will have all hell to pay if we don’t follow the law herejudge i know it sure thing yes yes mr carrrer you will all approach the benchthe fire had gone out of all except chief gober the search had revealed nothing that they could legally use there was nothing to charge us with the cocaine belonged to freddie the hitchhiker and it had been illegally discovered the state police were mostly now on carter’s side with much conferring and words in the ear carter and the other lawyers made a deal with the judge very simple the judge would like to keep the hunting knife and drop the charge on that—it hangs in the courtroom to this day he would reduce the reckless driving to a misdemeanor nothing more than a parking ticket for which i would pay 0 with the 00 in cash that carter had brought down with him he paid a bond of 0 for freddie and the cocaine and it was agreed that carter would file to have it dismissed on legal grounds later—so freddie was free to go too but there was one last condition we had to give a press conference before we went and be photographed with our arms around the judge ronnie and i conducted our press conference from the bench i was wearing a fireman’s hat by this time and i was filmed pounding the gavel and announcing to the press “case closed” phewit was a classic outcome for the stones the choice always was a tricky one for the authorities who arrested us do you want to lock them up or have your photograph taken with them and give them a motorcade to see them on their way there’s votes either way in fordyce by the skin of our teeth we got the motorcade the state police had to escort us through the crowds to the airport at around two in the morning where our plane well stocked with jack daniel’s was revved up and waitingin  the political ambitions of governor huckabee of arkansas who was going to stand in the primaries as a contender for the republican presidential nomination extended to granting me a pardon for my misdemeanor of thirty years previous governor huckabee also thinks of himself as a guitar player i think he even has a band in fact there was nothing to pardon there was no crime on the slate in fordyce but that didn’t matter i got pardoned anyway but what the hell happened to that car we left it in this garage loaded with dope i’d like to know what happened to that stuff maybe they never took the panels off maybe someone’s still driving it around still filled with shitcontinues excerpted from life by richards keith copyright   by richards keith excerpted by permission all rights
