research inc homeproducts products inflammatory response research inc irr is a drug development company focused on pharmaceutical products for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and conditions our initial product is a combination of levocetirizine xyzal® and montelukast singulair® at specific dosing for the treatment of the common cold as a ‘behind the counter’ dose pack  in parallel are the development of injectables for use in traumatic brain injury and acute radiation syndrome products in development levocetirizine marketed commercially as xyzal® in the united states by sanofiaventis and ucb levocetirizine is indicated among other things for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis levocetirizine is the most effective antihistamine on the market based on safety and efficacy montelukast marketed commercially as singulair® in the united states by merck montelukast is approved for the treatment of asthma exercised induced asthma and the relief of symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis clinical data to date generated by dr may supported by independent laboratory research suggests the combination of levocetirizine and montelukast shortens the traditional  day course of influenza and the common cold by  both compounds have excellent safety profiles markets the common cold the number of cold treatment eligible patients is expected to grow to about  million by  mirubi group   the us market opportunity for the common cold ranges from  billion to  billion  presently there is no fda approved product that both treats the symptoms and shortens the duration of the common cold traumatic brain injury there is a marked unmet need in this area of medicine with an estimated cost to society of  billion  year traumatic brain injury tbi remains the us military  medical unmet need levocetirizine  montelukast can be used in existing treatment paradigms to safely reduce morbidity and mortality in acute brain and lung injury without the side effects associated with steroids  steroids were removed from the cns treatment guidelines in  due to an  relative increase in twoweek mortality  there is currently no safe and effective product to actively treat inflammation following traumatic brain injury acute radiation syndrome existing therapy for acute radiation syndrome is supportive iv fluids prophylactic antibiotics ace inhibitors for pulmonary fibrosis and bone marrow transplantation levocetirizine  montelukast as an injectable will allow exposed individuals to tolerate higher doses of radiation while protecting vital organs  the addition to treatment protocols has the potential to benefit millions of people worldwide scientific rationale a detailed examination of the pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine at the cell level illuminates the unique antiinflammatory properties that extend beyond the ige mediated release of histamine most important are its low volume of distribution  lkg ideal drug ≤  lkg prolonged dissolution time from the h receptor in an acidic ph enhanced receptor affinity as the pure isomer of cetirizine fastest onset  hour fastest to steady state approximately  hours and the highest receptor occupancy at  hours of any currently available antihistamine such parameters impart an antiinflammatory effect by down regulating the signaling proteins il il and il as well as cellular adhesion molecules the latter are a homogeneous group of inducible immunoglobulins integrins and selectins involved in celltocell adhesion cellular recruitment homing and healing levocetirizine has been shown in a laboratory model to decrease icam il il tlr expression and nfkappa b activation resulting in decreased human rhinovirus hrv titers by log levocetirizine inhibits rhinovirusinduced icam and cytokine expression and viral replication in airway epithelial cells separate research has shown that many rhinovirus serotypes share the same cellular receptor identifying icam as the portal of entry into the cell independently a onelog reduction in viral shedding results in a significant clinical benefit in hrvinfected patients montelukast acts at the cyslt receptor to inhibit the physiologic action of leukotriene d ltd leukotrienes are protein mediators of inflammation similar to histamine however x more potent than histamine in the lung ltd is the most potent cysteinyl leukotriene in contracting smooth muscle thereby producing bronchoconstriction moreover both montelukast and levocetirizine are known to reduce the quantity of eosinophils or their migration to the site of inflammation an eosinophilic infiltrate is considered a ‘hallmark’ of inflammation acting at multiple points within both the innate and adaptive environments of the immune system an injectable combination will be ideal as a ‘first response’ medication for the treatment of traumatic brain injury tbi and acute radiation syndrome ars dose

conventional carbon black is used for reinforcing and tinting primarily in the rubber and plastics markets irr black has been shown to replace conventional carbon black in many applications  these products are used across multiple industries including automotive construction agriculture electronics and industrial segments such as equipment motors and hvac a better carbon black irr black is an alternative form of carbon black that can be used in many applications that conventional carbon black is used as the product is ‘recovered’ from end of life tires it retains much of the original performance characteristics of the original grades of carbon black that went into the tire when it was initially produced irr black can be a suitable replacement for many ‘coarse’ grades of carbon black nn series and can be compounded with virgin blacks to produce comparable performance properties this makes irr black an ideal choice as an alternative product in many applications requiring reinforcing or tinting irr black enables optimal processing in customer manufacturing operations high energy oil irr’s process also recovers a liquid phase organic condensate product often referred to as ‘pyrolysis oil’ this oil has high energy value similar to that of a  fuel oil allowing it to be sold into various applications and can be further refined into higher value specialty products gas energy source currently the pyrolitic gas generated is consumed within irr’s production process excess gas can be used to generate electricity thereby offsetting operating costs for irr and our
