prudential mortgage capital company by alessia pirolo march    am the mortgage observer caught up with outgoing pmcc president david twardock at last month’s mortgage bankers association in san diego we covered the upanddown nature of the business as well as his postpmcc planssee also pgim’s marcia diaz talks originations and the evolution of the life company   david twardock the mortgage observer you’re retiring this month after over  years with prudential have you spent your entire career there david twardock no i had a twoyear stint with otis elevator company i was an elevator salesman the joke is that i went from one upanddown business to another how did you move to real estate i was working on my mba at the university of chicago because i wanted to transition into the real estate business prudential came in and interviewed me on campus in  i was fortunate enough to get hired thinking that i was going to work my way into the development side of prudential prudential was one of the biggest real estate developers if not the biggest in the country in the early s but you didn’t end up in development i never got that spot prudential had been out of the mortgage business because interest rates were so high from 9 until  i spent the first couple of years buying buildings selling buildings and managing assets then in  they decided they wanted to get back in the commercial mortgage business and they drafted me to be in that business i was not happy with that i wanted to be building buildings i didn’t want to be financing them it turned out to be the best thing that could have ever happened to me it was a brandnew organization nobody had had any experience doing this for five years and it gave me an opportunity to really step into a business area with prudential’s brand and financial backing and do deals as a really young guy i was  years old and i was doing major deals in chicago how did you move up within prudential i ran the new york office from  to 9 then they asked me to move to corporate headquarters in newark and i started running about a third of the country for our lending operations i had always wanted to get back to chicago and they sent me back in 9 but three years later they said “we need you back in new jersey and you’re going to be running a major business” that was in the mid’s and the first assignment that i had when i got back to new jersey was to downsize our real estate operation by about  percent it was really difficult was it the most difficult time in your career yes that was the most difficult just because of the impact on people it was half of the organization hundreds of people but after that the business sort of reestablished itself and i was given the job of running the real estate equity business for prudential’s onbook portfolio we had about  billion of equities at the time john strangfeld—who is now our chairman—was my boss and we came up with a strategy to significantly reduce those holdings anything particularly creative that you did we were one of the original investors in strategic hotels which is now a major hotel company we took our assets and together with goldman sachs we formed that company we sold to boston properties some major assets—the prudential center in boston the embarcadero center in san francisco two of the sites at times square that they ultimately developed we took back stock positions in boston properties as part of that we sold our industrial portfolio to meridian industrial trust for a nice sale we took back stock meridian later was merged into prologis and we got another nice return on stock after we sold it can you talk about your role as a head of prudential mortgage capital company they brought me in to run pmcc in 9 at the time pmcc was an investment division like a lot of life companies have we were investing prudential’s money and we had the idea of trying to commercialize the business and so we got capital we formed a securitization conduit we bought a company called wmf in  which gave us a fannie mae dus license and fha and ginnie mae license we consolidated all that and formed a servicing business in dallas which was new for us the net of all that was through the s we had more pockets of capital what was the difference between prudential’s cmbs business pre and post we stopped the cmbs business in  we’ve now formed a venture with perella weinberg partners called liberty island group that does that business but in a different way before  we did everything on our balance sheet we originated it and we put it on our balance sheet we hedged and we contributed to a securitization it was completely a balance sheetbased business with perella weinberg they provide most of the capital for that venture and it’s not on our balance sheet we make a loan that goes on the venture’s balance sheet we have a small economic stake in the venture but much smaller a fraction than what we had before our primary role is to be the operating partner for the venture so we originate we have the securitization team we get paid more on fees and on the success of the venture that we do on any balance sheet business this takes the risk off the table what are your plans after retiring at the end of march it will be my last day in the office i’m going to take six months and enjoy my sailing and my golfing and my outdoor activities and then i’m not going to take another job i’m just going to maybe do some board work and advisory work but i’m going to own my own time more than i do now apiroloobservercom keywordsdavid

durning has deep roots yesterday’s announcement that prudential mortgage capital co president david twardock will retire in april to be succeeded by david durning currently senior managing director and the company’s head of originations goes back  years by scott baltic  dec   dec comma  national news facebook twitter google linkedin email subscribe to cpe david twardock yesterday’s announcement that prudential mortgage capital co president david twardock will retire in april to be succeeded by david durning currently senior managing director and the company’s head of originations is obviously big news coming as it does from such a cre lending powerhouse what might not be immediately apparent is how this transition is based in twardock’s longtime emphasis on developing talent within the prudential organization though neither twardock nor durning was available for interviews as of press time it’s possible to see how the roots of this succession go back more than  years a profile of twardock in the november  issue of commercial property executive noted that he saw the company’s thenongoing expansion of its loan servicing business especially its special servicing team as a signal learning opportunity particularly for more junior staff “special servicing is a great training ground for younger professionals” he said because of the long cre growth streak twardock said “people can go through half their careers without seeing a problem” to truly understand the business he contended a loan officer has to understand “what this stuff looks like when it goes bad” david durning at a decisive point in durning’s early career at prudential twardock’s mentoring played a crucial role after durning graduated from harvard business school he joined pru in  and worked for about  months as an investment analyst in prudential mortgage capital’s boston office this initial assignment however coincided with a recession and one day twardock told durning privately that prudential had decided to close the office though the flip side was a chance for the younger man to work in loan originations and workouts in prudential’s new york office leaving boston was complicated by the career of durning’s wife catherine who was practicing law there twardock’s headsup gave both durnings to make a smooth professional and geographic transition “i was greatly appreciative” durning said “because it allowed me to have some control over my life” by making it possible for his wife to get a new job in the new york area once he steps up in april durning will have substantial shoes to fill despite the recession prudential mortgage capital under twardock’s leadership has introduced several new initiatives in september 9 for example the company formally launched a lending operation in japan a contrarian move at a time when many institutional players had recently exited that market tomoyuki ishikawa head of prudential mortgage capital’s tokyo office noted at the time that the enterprise addressed a significant gap in japan’s real estate capital markets by offering longterm fixedrate financing to investors prudential provided an alternative to the shortterm floatingrate debt more commonly available in japan in april  prudential mortgage capital closed its first loan in japan a  million financing package for an affiliate of mitsubishi corp secured by five logistics buildings mostly in tokyo that same month prudential launched agency gateway a shortterm lending program designed for properties that are not yet eligible for permanent financing from a governmentsponsored enterprise the program was designed to provide loans of  million to  million to properties that are newly completed or renovated but have yet to reach stabilized occupancy in addition to his mba from harvard durning has a bachelor’s degree from middlebury college and holds the chartered financial analyst designation before joining prudential he was a lending officer at chemical bank and a corporate finance associate at shearson lehman in addition to his role at prudential mortgage capital durning is a member of the prudential investment management investment committee and serves on the executive board of the national multifamily housing council he is a former vice chair of the fannie mae dus advisory council and is a member of the urban land
