in search of worthy projects though we also have other models for collaborating with experienced “drug hunters” see translation and hunting tab  beyond capital in addition to capital ra capital invests considerable time and resources into helping its private and public portfolio companies succeed we leverage our techatlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for inlicensing consideration members of our investment team take board andor observer seats when appropriate we also host board meetings at our offices from time to time providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions we help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us in certain cases we may license one or more maps to them when appropriate our team can create a custom map that comprehensively aggregates and organizes rd opportunities as well as competitive and complementary technologies in those indications portfolio companies have access to the techatlas team’s primary scientific and market research we interview clinicians and kols host advisory boards and attend many academic conferences our literature surveillance team flags discoveries that may be important to portfolio companies our graphics design team helps portfolio companies communicate complex concepts with high quality graphics for their slides and websites sometimes incorporating techatlas map elements our communications team can offer assistance with grant writing and preparation of scientific publications tab  translation  hunting we are interested in both the novel and the reimagined discoveries and improvements in chemistry molecular and cell biology and material science create novel capabilities that open up new possibilities for tackling previously unsolved challenges the rules by which we understand biology are also constantly being defined and revised revealing new applications for existing technologies and partiallydeveloped drug candidates programs we consider worthwhile may form the basis for a new venture ra capital’s techatlas platform is designed to systematize the translation of novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation in those areas that we have mapped it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanisminspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned trial designs and endpoints competing and complementary agents current and future standard of care market size comparable pricing financing strategy and potential acquirers all meant to enable a thoughtful firstpass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment the size and efficiency of our team allows us to parallelize the firstpass assessment of many ideas sourced from literature technology transfer offices pipelines of large pharma as well as small biotechnology companies as well as discussions with academic researchers and clinicians we welcome experienced drug hunters searching for technologiescandidates and looking to start new companies to collaborate with our team and take advantage of the breadth and depth that the techatlas platform has to offer as well as the capital we manage we believe that when a business proposition is framed correctly the capital markets have the resources and depth of understanding to fund proper experimental design and solution development without forcing companies to cut corners and we have collaborated extensively with other funds that share our philosophy to enable ambitious and capital intensive endeavors we owe a debt to the people who have mentored us and we in turn have a responsibility to turn our hard won lessons into a solid foundation for our industrys emerging innovators and

performance ra capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes which converge on a higher quality and more costeffective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes these investment themes may change in the future prevention  cures diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent andor cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression especially if only incrementally we are interested in ambitious objectives hard outcomes measures and proper controls costeffective diagnostics  interventions most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness we are interested in seeing data from phase  and phase  clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors genetic testing  personalized medicine we are looking for companies with lowcost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing andor other diagnostics including exclusive access to relevant wellcurated patient samples and healthcare outcomes we have particular interest in a number of current niche areas including carrier tests prenatal tests and the combination of preimplantation diagnosisivf because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of lowcost sequencing patientphysician convenience there will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an outpatient procedure allowing a patient to take an oral pill or selfadminister a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an iv infusion or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results however until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched eg in the us physicians in private practice have a financial incentive aka “asp” to prescribe expensive ivadministered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive smallmolecule replacements for biologics although it is clear from the fda guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilarsbiogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that smallmolecules are when patents expire it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation we are interested in smallmolecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacysafety to biologics ideally with greater convenience to patients eg oral pills vs injectables we expect that all else being equal public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” smallmolecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics  park plaza boston ma  t  contact us ra capital management  park plaza suite  boston ma  t wwwracapcom top contact

letter to the board of cypress bioscience september    am eastern daylight time bostonbusiness wirera capital healthcare fund lp today announced that it has sent the board of directors of cypress bioscience inc “cypress” or “the company” nasdaq cypb a letter urging that to maximize stockholder value they engage in negotiations with ramius find another buyer or make a significant cash distribution the text of the letter sent to the cypress board of directors follows letter ra capital management llc park plaza suite boston ma  september   to mr roger l hawleydr amir kalalidr jay d kranzlermr jon w mcgaritydr perry b molinoffdr tina s novamr daniel h petree to the board of directors of cypress we are a large stockholder of cypress bioscience inc the “company” having beneficial ownership over approximately  shares of the company’s outstanding common stock we are writing in response to the company’s august   press release that publicly announced that the board of directors of the company the “board” rejected the offer previously made by ramius llc “ramius” to purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company at a price of  per share the company’s press release stated that the board rejected the offer by ramius because it was not in the best interests of all of the company’s stockholders and that the company would continue to work with jefferies  company inc and perella weinberg partners to evaluate strategic alternatives we consider the company’s stated objective to “evaluate strategic alternatives” to be too vague for our comfort given that the company has just rejected the opportunity to negotiate with a potential acquirer we would like to be explicit about what courses of action we would like the company to take to represent our best interests so that the company and the board do not need to speculate on this matter certainly we do not speak for all stockholders but we are confident given the recent trading history of cypress stock that many would agree with our position we are confident that it would be in the best interests of all stockholders for the company to enter into immediate negotiations with ramius and any other party for an acquisition of the company at a price of share or higher however even if the best offer the company could come up with were as low as share taking this offer would represent a better outcome for all shareholders in our opinion than continuing to spend the company’s remaining cash and royalty income on the current illconceived pipeline and on inlicensing new compounds if the company or the board decides to contemplate the company’s options for longer than an additional two weeks we would like to see the company stop all spending and distribute all current cash immediately to the company’s shareholders keeping only enough to fund the auction of the savella royalty whose proceeds we would also want the company to distribute as soon as possible if the company and the board are convinced that there is value in the company’s pipeline the company can try to raise additional capital from investors to fund the development of those programs but the company most certainly does not have our support in spending the company’s existing cash or royalty income on these new programs we think the company and the board will discover that there is just as little interest among investors in the bioline drug when the company is pitching the story as when bioline was pitching it in the year preceding the company’s deal with them the same is true for the other two assets the company recently inlicensed we recognize that the company and the board may dismiss our letter in the same manner that the company and the board have dismissed ramius on several occasions therefore we would like to take this opportunity to create a public record urging the company and the board not to do so and stating very clearly that this is not in the best interests of any of the company’s stockholders the record as of june   the company had share of cash royalties exceeding share expected over the next  months and a plan to create additional value by spending the cash on new drug development however in the month following the announcement of the bioline licensing agreement june   over  million shares representing the majority of the company’s float traded below share with  days of trading at or below  and the stock hit a low of  there is absolutely no question that the overwhelming vote of the shareholders during that period was that the company had made a mistake they assigned a negative less than zero value to the company’s pipeline and its business plan and concluded that the company had destroyed value by committing cash and future resources to the bioline drug we know this is what shareholders concluded because of the extensive deliberate and prolonged selling of shares by shareholders at a price that reflected a belowcash value of the whole company for an entire month investors weighed the evidence and concluded that the company and its pipeline were worth less than zero had the stock price recovered quickly within a few days one could have assumed that the drop in price was due to a transient inefficiency caused by a few investors not appreciating the merits of the licensing deal while savvier investors stepped in to snap up shares and bid them back up to predeal price but to have such high volume selling at stock prices below the cash per share for such a long time is nothing short of damning when on july   ramius announced their desire to negotiate for an acquisition of cypress for a price of share the stock rapidly rose to trade over share with  million shares trading at an average price of share from july th through august th again there can be no question that the majority vote of the shareholders during that period was that the prospect of being bought out by ramius or anyone at share or higher was more compelling than pursuing the company’s current business plan we consider the recent trading history of the stock to be clear evidence that shareholders thought that the company had a positive enterprise value prior to the bioline announcement that it had a negative enterprise value after the bioline announcement anticipating that management would burn cash without creating value and that the only way they will generate a return on their investment is if the company were sold to ramius or another acquirer in case there was any doubt one can even see how on august th immediately after the company announced the inlicensing of two more drugs the stock sold off again over several days with high volume given that ramius has offered share to buy the company why would shareholders sell the stock on this news for as much as a  discount to this price stock sold for a low of share on august   unless as a result of the news they were now more fearful than before that management was intent on blocking the sale of the company to ramius or another suitor the fact is that the company’s stock is now held to a large extent by shareholders who believe that there is more value in selling the company to ramius or a higher bidder in an expeditious manner than in letting the company continue to operate as it has been management and the board may think that many of these shareholders bought the stock recently and somehow their interests are less important than the interests of shareholders that the company considers loyal to its longterm strategy the fact is that a huge number of these “loyal” shareholders voted with their feet and couldn’t sell their stock fast enough well under the share ramius is now offering for the company had you not disappointed those shareholders who believed your pipeline had value they may have remained shareholders you would have had a mandate to continue with your plans to operate the company as you had been doing and your stock would have reflected your shareholders’ support of your plan by trading with a positive enterprise value but now in light of the large trading volume in the stock since the ramius offer was announced and the fact that the stock price traded up as a result of the ramius offer it is clear that many of your current shareholders actually bought stock thinking that it would be a good outcome if the company were sold at a price of  per share or higher the greatest fear of your current stockholders is that management and the board might actually choose not to sell the company at a price of  per share or higher and that all of the company’s cash will be spent on its pipeline the company now has a new set of shareholders who see value in a different strategy and it is the fiduciary duty of the board and management to consider their best interests if management or the board has any doubts that the company’s current shareholders want management and the board to sell the company for share or more to ramius or another acquirer then you should call a shareholder meeting and give everyone a chance to vote but do not claim that rejecting any negotiations with ramius is somehow in shareholders’ best interests negotiations with ramius are exactly what shareholders want from management and the board appeal to individual board members we feel it is necessary to appeal to each of you individually to make sure that you understand that shareholders hold you personally responsible as members of the board and presumed fiduciaries and that each of you will be to blame if you continue to allow the company to neglect shareholders’ best interests by spurning direct negotiations with interested potential acquirers such as ramius mr roger hawley you are currently the ceo of a private company zogenix which has just filed an s to go public zogenix no doubt has investors to whom you answer and whose interests you represent you are also on the board of other companies that depend on the support of investors what message are you sending current investors and prospective investors of all your other companies when against the publicly expressed wishes of major shareholders of the company you continue to support a business plan for the company that is preventing the company’s shareholders from realizing a return on their investment the company has for years now been wasting its resources on one failed inlicensed program after another as was outlined clearly in arcadia capital advisors’s most recent letter september   to the board management has a track record that suggests to us that they have been running the company as their own personal nonprofit cro we ask that you put a stop to this ongoing violation of cypress shareholders’ interests if you do not should current and future shareholders of zogenix worry that the same thing is going to happen to them someday dr amil kalali given your current role as vice president of medical and scientific services at quintiles a respected global cro we can appreciate that you are an insightful board member when it comes to matters of how to run clinical trials we see from your bio that you sit on many scientific advisory boards and on the boards of nonprofit organizations but from your bio it would appear that serving on the cypress board is among the first of your experiences as a fiduciary of a public company we ask that you give very careful consideration to whether you are currently representing shareholders’ best interests when you support the company’s plan to spend its cash and royalty stream on clinical programs you must have a great appreciation for the risks of drug development what we have tried to make clear in this letter is that the company’s shareholders do not want to see the company risk its current cash and the value of its royalty stream on these programs in light of this why are you continuing to substitute your judgment for that of the shareholders’ as to what is in their best interests mr jon mcgarity your biography mentioned that you run ethix associates which specializes in pharmaceutical business planning and strategy you clearly understand the risks of drug development the value of cash and the importance of taking shareholders’ perspective into account when risking their cash on drug development you have the expertise to appreciate that cypress could very well lose all of its cash and squander its royalty stream on these new programs that better capitalized companies were willing to pass on note it is clear that bioline alexza and marina had all shopped them around all three are public companies eager to maximize value cns drugs in particular are extremely difficult to bring to market because of the high safety hurdles difficultly in finding good animal models and especially the subjective endpoints susceptible to placeboeffect it’s up to the management team to match the right investors with their plan however management does not have the support of the company’s shareholders who would prefer to see management preserve cash and sell the company maybe the key question is if you bundled cypress’ three new drugs into a brand new company would you be able to raise capital from new investors to fund further development if you think so then we urge you to spearhead this effort however the current shareholders are clearly distressed at the prospect of the company pursuing this agenda using shareholders’ current cash and royalty stream while shareholders are unable to call a special meeting in which to voice their best interests we are confident that with your years of experience you must have a good sense of what shareholders would say if you were to ask them we therefore ask you to do the right thing and stop the company from risking current shareholders’ capital on these new programs and grant shareholders the opportunity to realize a return on their investment by selling the company to ramius or a higher bidder dr perry molinoff your bio highlights your considerable experience in neuroscience and cns drug development we know you appreciate the risks involved in this field especially since you also presided over the challenging development of palatin’s melanocortin agonist and the associated loss of shareholders’ capital we ask that you explain to your fellow board members the tremendous risks involved in each of the three programs that the company wants to pursue including schizophrenia smoking cessation and autism the last indication in particular may as well be a science project given the lack of validated endpoints and untested regulatory process these indications do represent areas of great unmet need but if pharmaceutical companies flush with cash did not see fit to spend a tiny fraction of their billions of dollars developing these drugs why are you prepared to allow a small and clearly undercapitalized company like cypress to spend what little cash it has on such risky programs why are you and the rest of the board so willing to take the risk of supporting this strategy in the face of clear shareholder opposition we ask that you participate in a frank and open discussion of the risks of pursuing cns drug development with your fellow board members and then vote to allow shareholders to realize the upside of letting ramius or a higher bidder acquire the company and dispatch the pipeline as they see fit if those drugs have any value someone else will bid on them dr tina nova you serve on a number of boards and have been involved with many companies and therefore have the experience to know that supporting the company’s plan to spend shareholders’ capital in the hope of hitting a home run despite the opposition of shareholders is a losing proposition any company looking for additional board members will consider the message it would be sending to its shareholders if it were to appoint a cypress board member if you want that message to be that the cypress board knows the value of shareholders’ capital and how not to waste it then please consider that the proper course of action is to put a stop to the company’s wasteful strategy immediately and push through the sale of the company mr daniel petree your biography shows that you have experience in investment banking and manage a boutique firm which no doubt gives you expertise in executing transactions not unlike the three cypress recently completed we assume that you supported the bioline deal but didn’t realize at the time that shareholders would disapprove of it and would vote against it by selling the shares to the point where the company’s enterprise value was negative now you know how unhappy shareholders are about the deal which you and jay kranzler spearheaded as the only two members of both the finance committee and strategic committee an arrangement we think was unwise and which the rest of the board should not have condoned and now that you know we believe that it is incumbent on you to serve as a proper fiduciary to your shareholders even if that means voting in favor of making the best effort to sell the company quickly and therefore negotiating with ramius if the assets you helped identify have clinical value they will find a new home and finally dr jay kranzler it was our sincere hope that you would have done the right thing by entering into discussions with ramius after their first letter and quickly sought other buyers but the fact that you both rejected ramius’ request to enter into discussions and then inlicensed two more drugs demonstrated a shocking disregard of the interests of cypress shareholders you teach a course on the business of biotechnology at the rady school of management at uc san diego and are its sole executive in residence you could still be remembered as a recognized authority on the drug repurposing paradigm but if you continue down this path we think that you will most likely be remembered as a poignant business lesson to students and executives alike on what not to do when at the helm of a company we wish your board had steered you better from our conversations with you over the years we felt that you understood the importance of having a mandate from your shareholders to risk capital on drug development in a calculated and prudent manner instead we have watched you steer cypress towards excessively risky programs squandering the resources of the company and cause the company’ stock to trade for less than cash value this company is not your personal nonprofit research organization yes it would be wonderful to find a treatment for autism help people stop smoking and give patients with schizophrenia respite from their debilitating symptoms under the right circumstances we might have offered to provide funding to one or more of these programs provided the rest of the business plan were well thought out but the company only gets to pursue those goals if it first wins over the shareholders instead you and the company have been dismissive of the shareholders not bothering to win their support for the company’s agenda the fact that the company’s stock dropped as much as it did and stayed down for as long as it did after the bioline announcement is proof that the company does not have shareholders’ support the fact that shareholders sold the stock when they saw the company inlicense two more drugs after rejecting ramius’ offer was proof that they would have preferred that the company negotiated with ramius than pursue a scorchedearth policy spending all the cash so that acquirers lose interest to reiterate we hope management and the board will do the right thing and immediately negotiate with ramius and others to sell the company for the best price you can secure until such a transaction is consummated we would like the company to cut all spending on every pipeline program and conserve cash sincerely ra capital healthcare fund lpby ra
