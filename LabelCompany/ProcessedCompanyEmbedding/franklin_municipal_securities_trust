historical cycle of low new issuance during the months of december and january this confluence of heightened investor demand and low supply for municipal debt made municipal bonds one of the bestperforming asset classes during the year under review however it is rare for the bond markets to experience such strong price returns over successive years longterm municipal bonds as measured by the lehman brothers municipal bond index have had a  average annual total return over the past  years and most of the return is a result of the income contribution not price appreciation historically equities have been the strongest investments for achieving price appreciation while bonds provided lower volatility and municipal bonds provided the highest aftertax total return for fixed income investors we do not expect these relationships to change over the long term although these asset classes may experience periods of extreme over and underperformance over the long term each broad investment category achieves its primary objectives as the nation realized a large federal budget surplus the us treasury initiated a buyback program for year treasury bonds increasing their scarcity and price while lowering yields this meant that on a relative basis longterm municipal bonds as measured by the bond buyer  came to yield as much as  of a comparable treasury bonds yield historically

portion of this income may be subject to such tax distributions of capital gains and of ordinary income from accrued market discount if any are generally taxable ratio is about  since municipals are taxexempt generally they yield less than treasuries which are subject to federal income tax when municipal bonds are yielding approximately the same as treasuries investors are able to take advantage of the tax exemption at little extra cost depending on your federal and state tax rates a taxable investment of comparable credit quality would need to offer a higher yield called the taxable equivalent yield to match the yield on a taxfree investment looking forward we view the municipal bond market positively we saw an increase in demand over the past two quarters which contributed to solid performance over the oneyear reporting period demand increased due to the favorable interest rate environment in  as well as unfavorable equity market performance we saw investors shift from a heavy focus on growth to a more traditional diversified portfolio of stocks bonds and cash as an investment strategy although we experienced a us economic slowdown state and local government finances through the period were very strong allowing them greater financial flexibility in times of slower growth most importantly we believe municipal bonds will continue to be desirable due to the tax efficiencies they offer predicting market cycles is very difficult even for professional economists  which is why we recommend investing for the longterm it is

how your fund earns taxfree income and how much of that income is actually paid to you or have you questioned why your monthly dividends fluctuate below youll find answers to these and other commonly asked questions about dividends paid by franklins taxfree funds q whats franklin taxfree funds dividend policy and how does it affect my dividend payments a franklin taxfree income funds attempt to set dividends on a quarterly basis this means that once a quarter in march june september and december we establish a fixed dividend amount per share that the funds will distribute over the next three months while the income the funds accrue varies daytoday we do our best to maintain this fixed dividend each quarter to provide our shareholders with a stable income stream not fdic insured  may lose

fund companies that work to stabilize dividend payments for three months at a time many other taxfree funds distribute dividends on daily income they accrue each month meaning their dividend payments can fluctuate every month q what are the sources of the income my fund distributes to me as taxfree dividends a your fund earns taxexempt interest income from its investments in municipal securities or bonds a municipal bond is an iou issued by state and local government agencies to raise money to fund public projects the issuing municipality makes interest payments to bondholders in this case the fund to compensate them for the use of their money until the bond is repaid franklins taxfree funds pay you this investment income as taxfree dividends less various operating expenses as you know these dividends are usually free from federal income taxes for a statespecific fund they may also be free from that states personal income taxes as well to the extent dividends are earned from interest on that states taxfree obligations sometimes the fund may also pay you accumulated dividends that were not previously distributed  alternative minimum taxes may apply not part of the shareholder report  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th q what other factors can affect my monthly dividends a generally interest rates are the biggest determinant of a taxfree funds earnings level and the amount of dividends paid to you for example when interest rates decline a funds investment earnings will decline as cash flow into the fund must be invested at the lower rates this means dividend payments will also decrease however since bond prices tend to move in the opposite direction of interest rates your funds net asset value nav will tend to increase causing your shares to appreciate in price similarly when interest rates rise the ability of the funds to increase their dividends will rise interest rate trends are primarily determined by economic factors such as inflation strength of the us dollar and the pace of economic growth strong economic growth can lead to inflation and the federal reserve may raise interest rates to cool the economy as we saw last year on the other hand if the economy slows down the federal reserve may lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth as happened earlier this year credit quality and maturity periods of the securities in a funds portfolio also play a role in determining the amount of income available to distribute to shareholders as explained below not part of the shareholder report  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th q why do some taxfree funds pay higher dividends than others a dividends are directly related to the composition of a funds portfolio first the credit quality of securities held helps determine a funds dividend payment ability highyield municipal bond funds for example can have higher dividend distributions than other taxfree funds this is because they hold lower creditquality municipal bonds that must pay higher yields than other securities to compensate investors for taking on additional risk however theyre also subject to higher risk than funds that hold higher quality bonds in their portfolios similarly longterm bond holdings in a funds portfolio tend to pay higher interest income than shortterm bonds to compensate for uncertainty associated with the future q how has the current declining interest rate environment affected monthly dividend payments a when interest rates decline municipal bond issuers often call or redeem their higheryielding bonds and replace them with new loweryielding securities so they can reduce the amount of interest they have to pay on the debt most municipal bonds are callable within  to  years after theyre issued because interest rates have generally been declining over the past  years our funds are experiencing bond calls on older higherincome securities not part of the shareholder report  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th consequently many of franklins taxfree funds have had to reinvest proceeds from these called bonds into loweryielding bonds resulting in lower earnings dividends because funds can only pay out what they earn many of our funds have had to reduce dividend payments as you can see in the chart below in the late s and early s we were able to invest assets at approximately  as these bonds matured or were called weve had to reinvest the proceeds at approximately  because we cannot invest cash flow at the higher levels weve had to reduce dividends we continue to pay out the income we earn but our earnings are lower today because were reinvesting at a lower rate than was available  years ago many of the securities being called today have provided high levels of income over the past  years as interest rates have trended down though we cant predict interest rate cycles well continue to focus on producing the highest monthly taxfree income

capital gains which are taxable to shareholders whether you reinvest them or receive them as cash though we work to reduce capital gains in periods of sustained low interest rates they are often unavoidable while shortterm capital gains on securities held in a portfolio for  months or less are treated as ordinary income distributions and taxed at regular income tax rates longterm capital gains on securities held in a portfolio for more than  months are taxed at lower rates sometimes a fund may invest part of its portfolio in private activity bonds which are basically municipal bonds issued to finance private activity interest earned from such bonds is exempt from federal income tax but its a preference item when calculating your alternative minimum tax amt liability so as required by the internal revenue code this income must be added to your regular tax income to calculate your amt income and amt tax liability if any in case your fund makes any capital gains

section is revised as follows  puerto rico the commonwealth of puerto rico along with its related issuers are among the largest and most widely held issuers of municipal bonds due in part to such bonds exemption from federal local and state taxes in all us states however certain municipal issuers in puerto rico have continued to experience significant financial difficulties credit rating firms standard  poor s fitch ratings and moody s investors service have downgraded their respective ratings of puerto rico s general obligation debt further below investment grade along with the ratings of certain related puerto rico issuers on september   standard  poor s downgraded puerto rico s general obligation rating to cc on july   moody s downgraded puerto rico s general obligation rating to caa following a june  downgrade by fitch ratings to cc additionally several of the other credit agencies have maintained a negative outlook on certain puerto rico issuers although the fund has not been required to sell securities that have been downgraded to below investment grade it is prohibited from making further purchases of any securities not rated investment grade by at least one us nationally recognized rating service in june  governor padilla signed into law the puerto rico public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act act citing a fiscal emergency relating to certain of its public corporations according to the governor the act was meant to provide a legal framework that can be used by certain puerto rico public corporations including puerto rico electric power authority prepa to seek protection from creditors and to reorganize and restructure their debt should they become insolvent although puerto rico is a us territory neither puerto rico nor its subdivisions or agencies are currently eligible to file under the us bankruptcy code in order to seek protection from creditors or restructure their debt the act by its terms does not apply to the commonwealths general obligation debt sales taxbacked bonds cofina or the debt of other agencies that is implicitly or explicitly backed by the commonwealth among other things the act would allow a minority of bondholders to bind the entire class of such holders and would allow investor collateral to be used for other purposes in the event that a public corporation becomes insolvent and takes advantage of the act holders of such public corporations debt such as the fund could lose certain of their rights as creditors of the public corporation bondholders likely would not receive timely payment of all principal and interest due to them and in some cases may not receive any further payments of principal and interest in addition the value of such debt would be impacted which could affect the funds liquidity and performance in june  certain franklin templeton mutual funds along with other unaffiliated funds filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico seeking a declaratory judgment that the act is unconstitutional and not enforceable in february  the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ruled the act to be unconstitutional puerto rico appealed the decision and on july   the first circuit court of appeals upheld the lower courts ruling the us supreme court has agreed to hear puerto rico s appeal of the lower courts rulings and oral arguments are expected in other than the act no statute expressly allows puerto rico to pursue a public bankruptcy or reorganization as an alternative to the act certain members of congress and others are advocating for the passage of bills in the house of representatives and the senate which would amend chapter  of the us bankruptcy code to permit puerto rico and its public corporations to file for bankruptcy it is uncertain whether any of these bills or similar proposals that may be introduced in the future will ultimately be passed into law and if so what the specific provisions would be if any such proposal were enacted it might restrict or eliminate the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives beginning in august  prepa puerto rico s main supplier of electricity has participated in ongoing discussions with its creditors including certain franklin templeton mutual funds about a framework to address prepa s financial and operational challenges as part of these discussions bondholders constituting approximately  of prepas bondholders agreed not to commence legal proceedings or exercise certain rights relating to claims of default in order to permit the negotiation of a possible financial restructuring in december  certain franklin templeton mutual funds along with other holders totaling approximately  of outstanding debt signed a restructuring support agreement the rsa  that would provide for among other things a restructuring of prepa debt implementation of this agreement was subject to various conditions and approvals including the need of the puerto rico legislature to approve legislation to establish a securitization framework for new prepa debt after the legislature was unable to pass prepa securitization legislation by the initial january   deadline set forth in one of the conditions the rsa was terminated prepa and the creditors entered into a new rsa on january   which incorporated most of the terms of the prior rsa with certain amendments including the  extension of the deadline to pass the securitization legislation to february  the securitization legislation received all required approvals when the puerto rico senate approved it on february   the puerto rico house approved it on february   and the legislation was signed by the governor of puerto rico on february  the results of this legislation could impact the value of debt issued by prepa which could affect the funds liquidity and performance on july   sp further downgraded the rating of puerto rico s government development bank after its president described an intention to do a debt exchange possibly at levels less than par additionally the puerto rico public finance corporation did not make full debt service payments due on the first business day of each month from august  through january these bonds required an appropriation by the legislature to pay debt service and an appropriation to make this payment was not included in the fiscal year  budget approved in june on december   the governor announced he would utilize existing law to clawback certain governmental revenues that have previously been directed to other public authorities and redirect them to the commonwealth s general fund some of these revenues are used to pay certain bond debt service of those authorities as a result on january   the puerto rico infrastructure finance authority defaulted on its bonds payable from federal excise taxes on rum it is unclear at this time if and when the clawback will result in a monetary default by other public agencies on february   the working group for the fiscal and economic recovery of puerto rico the commonwealth of puerto rico and the government development bank for puerto rico released a restructuring proposal which proposes to exchange certain debt of the commonwealth and related issuers for new bonds franklin templeton mutual funds together with their advisers are considering the terms of the proposal puerto ricos economy has traditionally tracked that of the us mainland however puerto rico entered its own recession in  ahead of the mainland and puerto rico has yet to recover the islands unemployment rate at fiscal yearend  was  before growing to a high of  at fiscal yearend it has dropped over the past few years to  at fiscal yearend  and is estimated at  as of november as of the april  estimate the puerto rico planning board projects that real gnp declined by  in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year estimates for  and  reflect a further contraction of  and  respectively other than slight growth of  in  the economy contracted in every fiscal year between  and total nonfarm payroll employment seasonally adjusted has increased a projected  on a yearoveryear basis as of november nonfarm payroll employment declined an estimated  in  and declined an estimated  in the largest employment sectors include services  government  trade  and manufacturing  while the manufacturing sector only makes up  of employment it is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product according to preliminary  data the manufacturing sector contributed  of total gdp the manufacturing sector has undergone some major changes pharmaceuticals biotechnology and technology became growth areas in the s but this trend has reversed since then with manufacturing employment declining  from fiscal years  to tourism an important component of the puerto rico economy had improved through early however with the us recession tourism slowed down having a negative effect on puerto rico s economy and tax revenues average fiscal year hotel occupancy rates previously peaked at  in  before dropping to  in hotel occupancy has been slowly rebounding and was a projected  as of october  down slightly from  as of april total hotel registrations dipped from  but increased  in fiscal year   in   in   in  and  in as of october  the yearoveryear growth was  according to the united states census bureau the population of puerto rico decreased by  from  to  and by a preliminary  from  to this loss is driven in large part by migration to the united states mainland the commonwealth has had deficit financial results for well over a decade the deficit operations resulted from incorrect revenue assumptions underestimated spending levels lack of financial management poor collection rates  and a weak economy among other things the fortuño administration took over in january  with the challenge of dealing with a projected  billion deficit for fiscal year the governor announced and began implementing a multiyear fiscal stabilization and economic reconstruction plan to comprehensively overhaul the government both financially and organizationally the main components of the plan included job cuts several temporary tax increases increased tax enforcement a reorganization of the government and a combination of the federal and a local stimulus plan this administration made improvements but the commonwealth still had deficit operations and required the use of debt to meet annual spending needs the commonwealth has not produced audited financial statements since june in january  the padilla administration took office in its first year in office the administration increased and extended the excise tax which was being phased out increased the sales tax base increased several taxes and passed sweeping pension reform the fiscal year  general fund budgetary revenues are projected at  billion which is just under fiscal year  revenues and approximately  million below budget with estimated expenditures at  billion resulting in a deficit of  million the commonwealth s liquidity position is very weak because the governments weak credit quality has led to higher borrowing costs as well as market volatility the government has chosen to use shortterm private placements to manage the government s liquidity puerto rico issued more than  billion of traditional longterm debt in march  and another  billion of shortterm direct loans and private placements in october  to help manage liquidity puerto rico has announced its intention to issue up to  billion through the puerto rico infrastructure financing authority to refinance a number of loans between the government development bank and the highways and transportation authority or issue tax and revenue anticipation notes the puerto rico infrastructure financing authority bonds would be secured by a portion of the recently increased petroleum business tax but the timing and details of either issuance are unclear at this time to help improve liquidity puerto rico has approved legislation that would allow it to eliminate monthly setasides for general obligation debt service if this bond deal does not occur additional legislation would also allow puerto rico to borrow from certain public corporations instead of issuing public debt in the bond market in may  the legislature and governor agreed on a  percentage point increase to the sales and use tax beginning july  this brings the overall rate to  with  payable to the commonwealth and  payable to the municipalities the sales and use tax would transition to a value added tax vat by april  included in this legislation was implementation of a  business services tax these tax increases are expected to raise  billion this tax increase formed the basis of the governor s proposed fiscal year budget the original fiscal year   billion general fund budget included  billion for operational expenses  billion in special allocations and  billion for debt service in addition to the  billion from the recently adopted tax increase the budget includes  million in spending cuts in december  the governor announced that budgeted revenues are now projected at  billion from a  billion revision in november as of september   puerto rico s total public sector debt topped  billion this figure includes not just general obligation debt but also debt secured by sales taxes as well as debt issued by puerto ricos public corporations and municipalities puerto ricos debt per capita levels are at the higher end of the spectrum compared to us states for two primary reasons first puerto rico generally centralizes the majority of its debt issuance at the territory level these debt levels have increased as puerto rico financed significant capital and infrastructure improvements and second the commonwealth has relied on the capital markets for funding of current year expenses puerto rico s government debt direct government debt has a first claim on available revenues under its constitution according to the preliminary june   actuarial report puerto rico continues to maintain a very large unfunded pension liability and its primary pension fund had an estimated funded ratio of below  using gasb  and its teachers retirement fund had a funded ratio of  using gasb  it also had an estimated unfunded other postemployment benefits opeb liability of  billion as of june  the commonwealth issued pension obligation bonds in early  secured by future employer contributions in march  the governor and legislature approved sweeping pension reforms to puerto ricos general retirement system which should help mitigate the huge increases in annual funding required of the government when assets are depleted this reform should reduce potential additional annual funding requirements from as high as  million a year to closer to  million the pension reforms were challenged but the puerto rico supreme court upheld their  constitutionality in june in late  the governor and legislature approved reforms to the teachers retirement system which were quickly challenged in april  the puerto rico supreme court ruled the reforms were unconstitutional and the governor has yet to comment on any alternative plans despite this pension reform the commonwealth still faces large pension requirements and a pension fund with an extremely large unfunded liability outstanding issues relating to the potential for a transition to statehood may also have broad implications for puerto rico and its financial and credit position the us house of representatives has considered legislation that would allow the residents of puerto rico to vote on its political status if approved by congress puerto rico would first hold a referendum asking residents if they prefer puerto rico to be a selfgoverning commonwealth or to change the islands status if a majority were to vote for a different status the island would then hold a second election to decide what status is desired one of these options would be statehood the president has recommended congress appropriate money for puerto rico to hold a nonpartisan election on the question of political status it is not clear what the timeline outcome or repercussions could be of such a vote on june   the governor of puerto rico citing a report commissioned by puerto rico and written by former world bank and imf officials publicly described puerto rico s debt as unpayable and called for a debt restructuring and the expansion of chapter  bankruptcy eligibility to puerto rico following the governor s comments moody s standard and poor s and fitch ratings all downgraded puerto rico s general obligation debt further below investment grade with sp adding that the potential for a restructuring of some or all of the commonwealths debt is a significant possibility over the next six months and market prices of puerto rico debt obligations generally declined on september   a governorappointed commission released a fiscal and economic growth plan for puerto rico this report was updated again on january  th although the report lacks detail it calls for the restructuring of a portion of puerto rico s debt it is unclear at this time what the implications are for the various puerto rico debt issuances please keep this
