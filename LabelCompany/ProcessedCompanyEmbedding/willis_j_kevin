willis still flying high in world of fashion june  0  ·   pm et – by tracy weissenberg when you enter the willis  walker atlanta showroom you immediately notice the details the room is made to welcome the customer make him feel as if he is in his own domain ready to purchase clothing especially tailored for him nba veteran and former hawks star kevin willis who studied fashion and textiles at michigan state founded the company in  with his college friend ralph walker “being seven foot and not being able to go anywhere and buy anything we weren’t even talking about fashion back then as far as that sense of style we just wanted something that we could put on and look halfway decent” says willis the first product was leather jackets made after an impromptu trip to new york to buy the leather which was then sewn by another friend after seeing people’s reaction to the jackets willis and walker took note of the immediate demand and recognized their potential niche the company gradually expanded to suits and in  launched the denim line willis now solely runs the company with partners in new york and talks about the brand’s evolution saying “now it’s more of a lifestyle collection it’s everything that a man can wear from outerwear to knits wovens suits jeans twill pants leather headwear tshirts all of that” while one might wonder the steps a professional basketball player took to fully absorb and ingratiate himself within the world of fashion he did what most other passionate and enthusiastic people out of college do internships asked to describe his style willis uses the phrase “dynamic elegance” and “simple classic modern” it is the same philosophy he has extended to his brand and from the showroom to the collection willis’ work is in the details as he points out even the company’s logo hints at the shape of a basketball going through a net while unintentional it could not be more fitting to reflect the merging passions of the former nba allstar nbacom let’s first talk about the showroom what was your philosophy behind this space kevin willis i think it’s a gem it’s a hidden treasure the location is spectacular right in buckhead it’s off peachtree when i came in it was an antique store at first so when the gentlemen moved out it was just open floor there was nothing here great space beautiful windows my mind really got going i was very anxious to start proceeding with developing and building and designing the whole showroom once i got going it took about one to two months to get to where i wanted to be we built the cabinets all of the shelves we painted we did four walls we did all of the glass walls upstairs i put all that stuff in i wanted it to feel like it welcomes the consumer when he comes to the door i want him to feel that this is speaking to him i wanted him to feel that he is at home in his own closet in his own environment where he didn’t want to leave that’s what i thought i wanted to create and we did it from the apparel to the seating the oversized chairs the larger counters the oversized sofa everything is a scale for guys who are taller nbacom there are so many details that connect the clothing to the design of this showroom did you have a hand in all of the interior decorating kw the interior decorating i did all myself everything from the very chairs that we’re sitting on the benches the artwork the lights the shelves that hold the jeans everything everything has this classic feel to it where it doesn’t feel that in two or three years you’ll have to change something out because it’s outdated that’s what i wanted to create i wanted a timeless feel once you walk in here nbacom how would you describe your company’s style kw it’s very modern it’s classic it has a timeless feel to it extremely comfortable the garments are wellfitted the fabrics are impeccable the balance of the garment is really good from the shoulders to the length of the coats the jeans are very comfortable i offer maybe five different fits and  or  different finishes from washes to raws to different coated fabrics to your clean 0 ounce all the way up to  ounce denim both in salvage and american goods i use four or five different actual denim mills to create this look and it’s been fun nbacom we all take it for granted to be able to walk into stores and buy clothing off the racks how big a novelty is it for a very tall guy to now be able to walk into a department store and purchase clothing that does not have to be custom made kw i’ve been shopping those stores for many many years and i don’t get frustrated because i understand their business model they don’t focus on guys foot foot and above that’s not their core customer their bottom line is to raise that bottom line they’re about getting product out that door my challenge was just to get them to understand there is a customer out there i know you want that customer but do you know how to get that customer i sort of had to educate the buyers i had to talk to the people on the sales floor and educate them about the actual product who this customer is how you could get this customer to come to your store maybe two and a half three times a year and buy this product selling the product i’m never worried about it sells itself nbacom people will walk into saks fifth avenue and see your finished line but can you talk about the process that it took to get there kw the process was extensive it was a long road because the biggest challenge i think for me was trying to get the fashion industry or the people in the fashion industry to take me seriously that was the biggest challenge even though i had a passion they know kevin willis as the nba player the guy who played  years or the guy who played with the atlanta hawks in my earlier days i would never say that’s not him because it is him because the nba has afforded me to do what i’m doing right now but i had to educate myself it’s one thing to make clothes but knowledge is the key — in any industry i had to understand the lingo speak the talk walk the walk learn the language learn the industry how to put the garments together from the patterns to the washes selecting fabrics dealing with the manufacturers so they won’t sort of put your stuff on the back burner because they’re getting a larger order coming in and build those relationships with those factories and have a good rapport with those guys and know how to deal with them since i was a smaller company once i did that i had to start to establish relationships with people in the industry from the media to the buyers to the store managers to the sales teams sales associates you have to build relationships with these people because once the product leaves me it goes into their hands if you don’t have that relationship or they’re not educated about your product they can’t sell that product if you can’t sell the product then the store puts it on sale and tries it that way if it doesn’t sell then you’re out the door nine times out of 0 they won’t bring you back my thing was to build those relationships first because the product speaks for itself once i learned about the actual garment the process it just fell right into place i always loved clothing and i wanted to bridge that gap and i’m speaking for the guys who aren’t in the nba or nfl or mlb they’re just tall men in corporate america or wherever but they want fashion they want to look cool they want to feel sexy they want to feel like they have not been sort of like outcasted and forgotten about that was my mission nbacom that’s very true about lingo how were you able to learn the fashion industry from the inside out kw the nba offers its players internships in the summer when we had our annual meetings every year every basketball season two or three seasons go by and i listened to the guys one year i broke my foot and i didn’t have to go to the meetings but i never forgot in those meetings that we would talk about if you want to further your education if you want to go back and do what you did in college or if you have a desire to get to dabble into corporate america — any field we can provide that service for you we can get that done for you during the offseason it was my offseason all year because my foot was broken i remember contacting the league and telling them ‘i want to do an internship in fashion can you guys help me’ they set everything up they actually flew me to new york i had to report to the nba office every morning at nine o’clock fully suited they would give me my schedule for the day i would take that schedule jump in a cab and go to each one of those appointments an hour two hours and learn everything i could for four summers straight i did that nbacom that sounds like a unique situation because you didn’t have to just intern with one company you got exposed to many different brands kw they were setting me up with appointments with say a company like perry ellis i would go into the perry ellis office meet who i needed to meet they would give me the everyday process from administrative to back office warehousing distribution fabrics how the garment was constructed even going to the actual manufacturing plants where they do all the sewing and you see tons of stuff so i had to go through all these different processes and channels and learn this and they’d go from nine o’clock until five every day and every day it would be a new company one of the ones i really remember is called the doneger group and they’re a forecasting group for the entire world anything that you need to know what’s coming out for  0 that’s their business they have all these relationships with people all over the world retailers anybody they taught me a lot of valuable information that i carry along to this day i’m still today in contact with those principals who helped me back in  nbacom lastly leave us with your vision for willis  walker kw my vision for willis  walker is to grow it into a lifestyle brand where every guy who’s shared that common thread — i can’t find anything that will fit me — who’s afraid to go into saks or any of these higherend retailers because he’s afraid to be turned down he’s afraid that they’re not thinking about me once i build this brand he will be able to one day go into those stores and buy something off the rack walk out of there with a smile on his face and say ‘you know what this guy has figured it out willis  walker has figured it out’ i want this to be a global lifestyle brand share on facebook opens in
