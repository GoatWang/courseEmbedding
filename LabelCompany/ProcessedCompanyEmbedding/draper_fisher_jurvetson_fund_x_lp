resetaa font size print court of chancery of delaware millenco lp plaintiff v mevc draper fisher jurvetson fund i inc john m grillos larry j gerhard harold e hughes jr and chauncey f lufkin defendants no civa      decided december   joseph a rosenthal carmella p keener rosenthal monhait gross  goddess pa wilmington delaware and richard w cohen david c harrison michelle rego lowey dannenberg bemporad  selinger pc white plains new york for plaintiff martin p tully david j teklits thomas w briggs jr morris nichols arsht  tunnell wilmington delaware and jonathan l greenblatt neil h koslowe sherman  sterling washington dc for defendants opinion and orderithe plaintiff in this action is millenco lp a privately owned company engaged in the business of investing for profit   millenco is the largest stockholder of the defendant mevc draper fisher jurvetson fund i inc the “fund” owning over  of the fund shares purchased on the open market for a total purchase price of more than  million   millenco has owned those shares continuously since before the record date of the funds  annual meeting of stockholders “ annual meeting”the fund is a delaware corporation organized as a closedend mutual fund that has elected to be treated as a business development company under section  the investment company act of   usc § a et seq the “ act”   the funds stated investment objective is longterm capital appreciation from venture capital investments in information technology companies   in march  the fund conducted an initial public offering of its stock at  per share realizing  of net proceeds   as of august   the closing price of the funds stock on the new york stock exchange had declined to  per share and the funds net asset value had declined to  per sharethe other defendants in this action are larry j gerhard harold e hughes jr chauncey f lufkin and john grillos who are the current members of the funds board of directors   before the ipo the founders of the fund appointed a fivemember board of directors consisting of the four individual defendants and peter s freudenthal   two of the five directors were representatives of the two fund advisers  freudenthal was a principal of mevc advisers inc “mevc advisers” and defendant grillos is a principal of draper fisher jurvetson mevc management co llc “draper advisers”   freudenthal was the funds president until he resigned in june    grillos has at all times relevant to the complaint been the funds ceo section a of the  act requires that a majority of the funds directors be independent   gerhard hughes and lufkin were appointed to serve as the funds independent disinterested directors   these three disinterested directors also comprised the funds threemember audit committeethe directors terms of office were staggered with freudenthal and grillos designated to stand for reelection to threeyear terms in  gerhard in  and hughes and lufkin in    freudenthal and grillos were reelected at the funds  annual meeting   gerhard was reelected in iithis action was begun on april     in the second amended complaint millenco seeks among other things to invalidate the elections of directors at the  and  annual meetings on grounds that the proxy solicitations conducted in connection therewith were materially false and misleading   at the heart of this claim lies the funds failure to disclose the existence of certain relationships between and among grillos an inside director and gerhard and hughes two nominally independent directors   these relationships arise out of the involvement of all three ie grillos gerhard and hughes in an enterprise known as evineyard inc millenco contends that full and accurate disclosure of the nature of those relationships was necessary for fund stockholders to make an informed judgment about the “independence” of both gerhard and hughesa grilloss involvement in evineyardthe business relationship of grillos and gerhard goes back for some years to a time when grillos hired gerhard as ceo of a company known as test systems strategy inc in  gerhard solicited grillos to be an initial investor in evineyard   eventually grillos invested  personally another  through itech which grillos managed as a principal as well as additional sums as a limited partner in osprey ventures which invested approximately  in evineyardin may  grillos was named to the evineyard board of directors and also appointed as both chairman of the board and chairman of the compensation committee   pursuant to the evineyard bylaws the chairman of the board is an executive officer of the corporation   moreover section  of those bylaws provides that “if the chief executive officer ie gerhard is not also the chairman of the board then the chief executive officer gerhard shall report to the chairman of the board ie grillos”   grillos continued to serve in these roles through november   when he resigned as chairman of the board and january   when he resigned as a director and as chairman of the compensation committee but retained board visitation rights   while he was chairman of the board and chairman of the compensation committee evineyard entered into a revised employment agreement with gerhard   grillos testified that he “took the lead” in terms of negotiating this contract with gerhardgerhard is a director of evineyard and served as its ceo at all relevant times   hughes is also a director of evineyard and for a time in  served as coo president   they are both substantial evineyard stockholdersb grillos and gerhard propose a fund investment in evineyardon november   the day after grilloss resignation as chairman of evineyard grillos and gerhard proposed a transaction that paul wozniak a principal of mevc advisers and cfo of the fund described as one in which “the fund would wind up owning evineyard stock in a deal that essentially boils down to a straight purchase of evineyard stock for  million despite the machinations created to make it look otherwise”   wozniak also noted  “even if this transaction proves technically legal which is questionable at this juncture the appearance of conflict is so great that we at mevc advisors do not wish for this deal to move forward”  c  proxy and electionin  grillos and freudenthal were up for reelection to the board at the annual shareholders meeting   on march   the fund filed a proxy statement with the sec that included the boards recommendation for the reelection of these two directors   the proxy statement disclosed grilloss and freudenthals status as “interested persons” of the fund due to their affiliation with the funds investment advisers   it also disclosed that gerhard hughes and lufkin were the funds “disinterested” directors   grilloss biography included a description of his positions with the fund and its subadviser and certain other positions he had held or was holding at the time   it did not disclose his positions with or investment in evineyard or his relationships with gerhard and hughes grillos and freudenthal ran unopposed and on april   were reelected to threeyear termsd  proxy and electionon february   the fund filed with the sec the proxy statement for the  annual shareholders meeting   the proxy included two boardrecommended proposals for shareholder approval  i new advisory agreements with the funds investment adviser and subadviser and ii gerhards reelection to the board   the proxy statement disclosed that gerhard was not an “interested” person of the fund his biography included his position as chairman of the board of evineyard having succeeded grillos as well as his prior positions as president and ceo of that company   it did not however disclose grilloss relationship to evineyard   gerhard ran unopposed and was reelectedmillenco opposed the ratification of the new advisory agreements and successfully conducted a campaign to defeat themiii the parties have crossmoved for summary judgment on millencos claim seeking to invalidate the  and  elections of directors on grounds of breach of the directors duty of disclosure  pursuant to court of chancery rule  summary judgment should be granted where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law  in deciding a motion for summary judgment the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that no material question of fact exists  “when a moving party has properly supported its motion however the nonmoving party must submit admissible evidence sufficient to generate a factual issue for trial or suffer an adverse judgment”   although the parties have crossedmoved for summary judgment that fact “does not act per se as a concession that there is an absence of a factual issue”   here there are no material issues of fact in dispute and the crossmotions present purely questions of lawit is undisputed that no information relating to grilloss association with evineyard gerhard and hughes was ever disclosed to the funds shareholders   instead the funds proxy statements have both disclosed that gerhard hughes and lufkin are “independent directors” who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of the  act while the  proxy statement discloses that gerhard and hughes are both affiliated with evineyard it does not disclose grilloss past or current relationships with that company millenco makes a plain and powerful argument that the omitted information about the grillosevineyard connection was material   first under delaware law the fiduciary duties of directors require that they disclose fully and with complete candor all material facts when they solicit proxies from stockholders  second that duty is “best discharged through a broad rather than a restrictive approach to disclosure”  and mere technical compliance with a statutory mandate or relevant regulations does not create a safe harbor from liability for deceptive disclosures or material omissions  third “an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding how to vote”   finally where as here the omitted information goes to the independence or disinterest of directors who are identified as the companys “independent” or “not interested” directors the “relevant inquiry is not whether an actual conflict of interest exists but rather whether full disclosure of potential conflicts of interest has been made”   applied to the facts presented millenco argues that the failure of either proxy statement to disclose or describe grilloss relationship to evineyard renders the proxy statements materially misleading and incomplete   a fund stockholder millenco suggests would certainly have regarded the omitted information material in deciding how to vote on the election of directors in both  and the defendants make two arguments to avoid the result urged by millenco   first they argue that because the directors do not meet the definition of interestedness under the  act the omitted information is immaterial as a matter of law   second the defendants argue that disclosure of the omitted information was not required because when viewed in the context of the totality of information regarding grilloss relationship to evineyard the omitted information does not bear materially on gerhards and hughess independence   these arguments are untenablewith respect to the first argument the defendants obligation to disclose information that materially bears on gerhards and hughess qualifications to serve as disinterested directors of the fund does not turn on some legal conclusion about their status under sec rules and regulations   sec publications in the area reinforce this point   on october   the sec in a release titled “interpretive matters concerning independent directors of investment companies”  stressed the importance of the independent directors role as “watchdogs” in investment companies   it concluded by issuing interpretive guidance concerning the situations under which a director would be deemed “interested” and therefore “not independent” as follows bracketed material addedthe staff believes that a fund director ie gerhard who serves as a chief executive officer of any company evineyard for which the chief executive officer of the funds advisor grillos serves as a director also may be treated as “interested”   the relationship between the fund director and the advisers chief executive officer may tend to impair the directors independence because the advisers chief executive officer has the power to vote on matters that affect the directors compensation and status as chief executive officer of the company   in this instance the fund director may act with respect to fund matters in a manner to preserve his or her relationship with the company and with the advisers chief executive officer rather than in the interest of the funds shareholdersthe need to disclose relationships of this kind was reiterated by the sec when it promulgated a new item  to schedule a to provide for a minimum threshold of disclosure obligations in proxy materials relating to the election of fund directorsb election of directors   if action is to be taken with respect to the election of directors of a fund furnish the following information in the proxy statement ․ if an officer of an investment advisor grillos ․ of the fund serves or has served since the beginning of the last two completed fiscal years of the fund on the board of directors of a company where a director of the fund or nominee for election as director who is not or would not be an “interested person” of the fund within the meaning of section a of the investment company act of  ․ is or was since the beginning of the last two completed fiscal years of the fund an officer gerhard and hughes identifyi the companyii the individual who serves or has served as director of the company and the period of service as directoriii the investment advisor ․ where the individual ․ holds or held office and the office held  andiv the director of the fund nominee for election as director ․ who is or was an officer of the company  the office held  and the period of holding the officethese amendments were effective as of january    thus when the  proxy statement was issued disclosure of these relationships appeared necessary as a matter of federal securities laweven if the relationships of the defendants did not fit perfectly within the ambit of section a requirements nondisclosure of the relationships is not excused under federal law   the sec emphasized as much when it noted that the disclosure requirements of schedule a were minimum requirements and not safe harbor determinations of materialitywe wish to emphasize that a funds independent directors can vigilantly represent the interests of shareholders only when they are truly independent of those who operate and manage the fund   to that end we encourage funds to examine any circumstances that could potentially impair the independence of independent directors whether or not they fall within the scope of our disclosure requirementsdefendants further attempt to argue disclosure is not required under the  act because the sec has not exercised its administrative powers under section a of the act to declare either gerhard or hughes to be interested persons   but the sec had no way of knowing about grilloss involvement with evineyard and its possible effect on the independence of gerhard and hughes because the defendants never publicly disclosed any of this information   thus the absence of action by the sec is both understandable and irrelevant   the sec realized that such a problem might arise under its disclosure regime and in its commentary to the amendments to item  stated the followingour amendments regarding circumstances that may raise conflict of interest concerns for directors benefit investors by enabling investors to decide for themselves whether an independent director would be an effective advocate for shareholders   disclosure of this type of information also results in its public dissemination bringing these circumstances to the attention of the fund shareholders and encouraging the selection of independent directors who are independent in the spirit of the act finally this information assists the commission in determining whether to exercise its authority under section a of the act to find that a person is an interested person of a fund by reason of having had at any time since the beginning of the last two completed years of the fund a material business or professional relationship with the fund and certain persons related to the fundfinally it must be said that a discussion of whether the supposedly independent directors were in fact independent under the  act is only of passing significance to the courts analysis   the real issue is whether the omission of the information in question violated the defendants disclosure duties under delaware law   in that sense disclosure is necessary if a stockholder would have considered the information important in deciding how to vote  as the foregoing discussion illustrates the omitted information would almost certainly be considered important in the context of an election of directors especially in the context of a registered investment companygiven the chance the funds stockholders could have reasonably inferred either from grilloss de jure powers at evineyard or from his de facto exercise of such powers that his roles at evineyard gave grillos actual or potential influence over gerhard andor hughes which influence could be viewed as affecting their judgment as independent directors of the fund further the defendants frequent references to gerhard and hughes as “independent” or “disinterested” directors of the fund strongly implies that they were free to act with complete and undivided loyalty to the fund the funds stockholders were entitled to know the omitted information in order to judge for themselves gerhards and hughess independence and disinterestedness the defendants second argument is that even if the omitted information tended to show a lack of director independence a complete understanding of grilloss relationship with evineyard shows that the undisclosed relationships could not have interfered with or diminished gerhards and hughess ability to act independently   this argument misconstrues the legal test to be applied  “materiality is to be assessed from the viewpoint of the ‘reasonable’ stockholder not from a directors subjective perspective”   in other words it does not matter whether gerhard and hughes each strongly held his ability to act independently of grillos or whether the other defendants shared this view   what matters is how a reasonable stockholder would have regarded disclosure of the facts relating to grilloss relationships to evineyard gerhard and hughes   millenco correctly argues that the facts surrounding these relationships bore on the directors independence and because there is a substantial likelihood a reasonable investor would have wanted to know about these facts in deciding how to vote on the elections of each of grillos freudenthal and gerhard needed to be disclosed in the  and  proxy materialsthe defendants efforts to explain away the omitted information by pointing to additional information that softens or mitigates the impact of the omission merely reinforces the conclusion that the fund stockholders should have been given the chance to decide for themselves how things looked   the possibility that with the benefit of complete disclosure the stockholders would have allowed these men to run unopposed for election can hardly justify the omission of any information at allin the end the defendants cannot escape the conclusion that they should have presented their explanations about the various relationships in the proxy statements in which they solicited votes for the election of directors at the  and  annual meetings   they were free to explain why they believed that the evineyard relationships did not have the potential to impair the independence of either gerhard or hughes as directors of the fund had they done so the stockholders would have been able to decide for themselves what significance to attribute to such facts and the accompanying explanations  what defendants were not free to do was to take the position that the stockholders had no right to know this information because they the defendants had determined it was not important iv in view of the courts conclusion that the election of directors at both the  and  annual meetings was procured by the use of materially false and misleading proxy materials the appropriate remedy is to order new elections to fill the three director seats that were up for election at those meetings  the record reflects that if millenco had been furnished with the omitted information in  or  it would have acted to oppose the elections   the courts of this state “have long held that inequitable conduct by directors that interferes with a fair voting process may be set aside in equity”   moreover the “right of shareholders to participate in the voting process includes the right to nominate an opposing slate”  the only remaining issue is whether to order a new election in advance of the  annual meeting of stockholders   the answer to that question will turn on when that meeting is or will be scheduled to be held   if the court receives assurances that such a meeting will be held within  days of the date of this opinion the court will be inclined to the view that only a single meeting needs to be conducted   if not the court will order the convening of a special meeting no later than february   for the purpose of electing  directorsvfor the foregoing reasons millencos motion for summary judgment is granted and the defendants crossmotion for summary judgment is denied   counsel for millenco shall submit an order in conformity with this opinion no later than december   on noticefootnotes   keener aff ex
