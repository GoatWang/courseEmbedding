ceo of cablevision james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer thank you cindi and good morning our second quarter financial results met our expectations consolidated revenue grew  and aocf decreased  compared to the prior year period yeartodate aocf is in line with our  outlook our capital expenditures during the quarter were  million free cash flow was  million and we continue to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of  per share declared on august th overall were satisfied with our results turning to operations the metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships we gained  total customers marking the first quarter of growth in more than two years new technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle its clear that the dynamic with the customers is changing which is why today the overall customer relationship number is more relevant to individual product metrics as a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country we saw these trends coming and that is why earlier this year we were the first and only provider to introduce cord cutter packages we recognize that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers so we are offering flexibility choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs we have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years beginning in  cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the new york market we made substantial investments in technology tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers most importantly we focused on the reliability and performance of our network as a result we more than doubled our broadband capacity optimized the density and quality of our wifi experience enabled a more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively these investments have also made our operations more efficient we have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly  compared to the  levels this has led to lower cost and improved customer satisfaction at the same time we chose to compete on value not solely on price by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies the changes in the way we do business have resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied that has helped decrease our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly sixyear low in the second quarter on the product side weve continued to innovate with our overthetop offerings and recent speed increase in our core data service we have also changed the cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people as a result we have created a performancebased culture throughout all levels of the company im going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about verizon our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business from a standing start we took more than  million of their residential phone customers and cablevision became a dominant phone provider in our market verizon has invested billions of dollars in fios in the tristate area today cablevision service more than  million customers down from  million customers at our peak in  this is despite fios heavilyfunded overbuild and deeply discounted pricing as well as the economy and other competitive forces the impact of fios on cablevision has been minimal to the extent that we have lost customers to fios we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest priced services fios has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against cablevision we believe that the verizon fios is an unprofitable business today and we doubt that they will ever be profitable our strategic plan and investments during the past three years have helped to transform cablevision our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer our voluntary churn is down and we have retained our highest value customers in addition today cablevision operates the nations most robust wifi network while verizon has no public wifi cablevision has changed its culture we no longer think like a monopoly and instead we are strategic effective and competitive our approach to connectivity as a new frontier is gaining traction this is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter the verizon fios effect if there ever was one in our opinion is over our business is healthy and im confident that it will get even stronger as we move forward with that let me turn the call over to kristin dolan for an operational and product update kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director thank you jim the actions weve taken over the last three years to reimagine cablevision have resulted in a faster more reliable network that excels at delivering new and sophisticated products and services expanding on jims update the improvements we have made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly servicerelated transactions for example through proactive monitoring of the network were able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected we triage every trouble call before we roll a truck identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls and weve armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution solving the problem in our first visit to the home these initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to a superior service experience accordingly second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased  as compared with the prior year period we also experienced a  reduction in calls to customer service over the same period we implemented a voice of the customer dashboard earlier this year to capture realtime customer feedback and measure net promoter score a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers responses to this new approach have been strong well harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies weve also continued to innovate in the product area in the second quarter we introduced our cord cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers to access video content through the internet the cord cutter offerings provide access to different levels of internet service at varying price points they all include a digital antenna at no charge for overtheair tv this allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as overthetop content these packages are attracting new interest they have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activity during the quarter with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of  total customers as jim mentioned we also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of  turning to our network our investments in this area have transformed our highspeed data service into the premier broadband offering in the new york marketplace let me share a few statistics during the last two years average data usage per customer has increased by  today  of customer relationships include broadband service in addition nearly half of optimum online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers and more than half of data customers use  gigabits or more per month now lets turn to wifi over the last three years wifi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics for example optimum wifi access points have increased from less than  to more than  million we rolled out  million inhome smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers and monthly wifi data usage per customer increased from less than  gigabyte to more than  gigabytes over the same threeyear period we will continue to make investments in our wifi network through the deployment of additional wifi access points in high data usage areas moving on other highlights for the quarter include offering hbo now and hulu as overthetop alternatives for our broadband customers entering into a longterm agreement with espn disney for our data and analytics service and continuing to work with other msos to provide combined insights from settop box tuning data were pleased with our progress in the first half of  and will remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships with that let me turn to brian sweeney to review our financial results brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer thank you kristin and good morning during the quarter total customers increased by  and highspeed data customers increased by  video and voice customers declined by  and  respectively were seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity improve network reliability and enhance customer service we have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly  to  as compared with the prior year period this performance was principally driven by recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies as well as increased transactional revenue from a payperview event during the quarter second quarter total cable revenue increased by  reflecting the increase in revenue per customer which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising cable aocf decreased  in the second quarter as compared with the prior year period this primarily reflects higher programming costs legal fees and product development and marketing costs partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer servicerelated costs i want to provide a little more color on our advertising business as compared with  second quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by  primarily due to reduced political spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year along with lower spending in the financial gaming and cable programming sectors the declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local recreational and consumer spending notably the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period and we are seeing pronounced interest in impressionbased sales moving on to capex cable capital spending in the second quarter was  million a  million decrease from the same period in  this primarily reflects lower yearoveryear spending on settop box and modem purchases as well as the timing of certain videorelated projects these declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and wifi expansion we expect increased capex spending in the back half of  as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience moving on to our other business segments lightpaths second quarter revenue increased  and aocf grew nearly  as compared with the prior year period the revenue increase reflects growth in ethernetbased services partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy tdmbased services aocf growth was also driven by lower expenses in our other segment second quarter revenue decreased  and the aocf deficit increased by  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at newsday partially offset by higher advertising revenue at news  the decline in aocf reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employeerelated costs at corporate partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at newsday now turning to the companys financial position the companys second quarter consolidated cash position was  million and net debt was  billion we had  billion undrawn and available under the  billion revolving credit facility at csc holdings as of the end of the second quarter as previously mentioned on our may earnings call during the second quarter we made a voluntary repayment of our csc holdings term loan b facility in the amount of  million this repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility we remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position at june th the companys consolidated net leverage ratio was  times the csc holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was  times we have not repurchased shares of cablevision stock during  and we have approximately  million of remaining stock repurchase authorization we continue to anticipate that  total company aocf and capex including incremental expenditures for new product initiatives will be substantially similar to our  results before we move to qa we know the topic of ma continues to be on all of your minds but this call is to discuss our second quarter results we will not be entertaining questions today relating to industry consolidation operator we would now like to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and your first question comes from jessica reif cohen of bank of america merrill lynch jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch oh thank you ive got two questions the first one i just wanted – i hope to followup on what kristin was just talking about on the video bundle kristin can you give any color on – you guys offer more choice in different packages this is obviously the – i mean given whats happened in the last few days and the fears that the bundle is falling apart and your experience can you tell us like whos taking the nontraditional packages the skinny packages how quickly are you seeing customers to pick – go down and move down from the big video packages traditional video packages to the skinny bundles kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director so let me start by saying that the skinny bundle – let me talk about it differently sorry the cord cutting packages are definitely making the phone ring but the bulk of people are still buying three products and the cord cutter packages are really going to new acquisitions to customers that we wouldnt normally get so were not seeing a migration of existing products moving to cord cutters or to skinnier bundles were really i think attracting new customers and also making the phone ring with the price point associated and then upselling the bulk of those customers to a traditional threeproduct bundle jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch so i guess just to follow up do you guys have a point of view on how quickly the traditional bundle will – how much in terms of – im sorry james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer yes i do jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch okay james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer hi jessica jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch hi jim james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer i dont think the sky is falling quite yet and i think that theres not enough programming weight yet in the internet right and then the overthetop services that are out there to really entice a mainstream video customer right youre going to see innovators et cetera some of the i wont call them fringe but some of the not mainstream video watchers start to adopt the overthetop i do think eventually though that there will be enough programming for overthetop to be competitive with the traditional video bundle but this is not something that i think is going to happen over a very short period of time the consumers have become very very comfortable with the amount of choices that cable offers and if you want to have a very very wide variety of choice the bundle actually is somewhat still efficient its essentially buying the entire magazine stand even though youre going to – because you want the choice of every magazine in there but you only look at maybe several a day or whatever but you dont want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand the consumers have gotten very used to that but its pricey and so as you continue to see that price push up which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates obviously on a regular basis particularly the broadcasters who see it as a bit of a pot of gold that will drive their people who are more price sensitive into alternatives and internet is obviously ip overthetop is starting to become a real alternative and then that is why we introduced the cord cutter package with the digital antenna because the digital antenna essentially takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with the traditional bundle and at a price thats affordable so yes i think its right for you to watch what happens with that but i dont think that were going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other and my own prediction is that it will be at least five years for  of the market to move and  years for  of the market to move jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch thank you james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer hows that for an answer jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you can i just ask one different question which is when would you reconsider reinstating the share repurchase program gregg g seibert  vice chairman jessica we view the dividend as the primary form of return of capital to our shareholders the original repurchase programs were put in place at a time when we had transactions that for one reason or another provided additional liquidity such as the spinoff of amc which provided a lot of liquidity for share repurchase but i think now the board is quite comfortable with the dividend being the primary return of capital im not going to rule it out but wed look at it only on an opportunistic basis at this point in time weve been reinvesting in the business paying the dividend and deleveraging those are the primary uses of capital jessica j reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch thanks gregg operator thank you your next question comes from ben swinburne of morgan stanley benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning i have one for jim and just a quick one for brian jim on you have repositioned the company as a connectivity company as you said and the subscriber numbers are showing thats been quite successful interestingly verizon seems to be going a little bit in the opposite direction with their go product where theyre actually getting into the programming business so when you guys look at your product suite and all the innovation that youve got there which again seems to be resonating nicely do you ever think about getting into a mobile programming package business or do you think thats just the wrong strategy and then brian im just wondering if you could talk about the payperview impact in the quarter for us given it was an unusually popular fight so we could understand that thanks james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer im actually going to pass that one over to kristin because thats really her thats her sweet spot area benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc sure james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer so go ahead did you get the question kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director yes no i didnt know if brian was going to go first weve had programming entities in the past that weve spun we understand the business really well i think its a crowded marketplace right now where i think they have seen success is things like having major league baseball available on an exclusive basis to mobile customers its a really expensive proposition i dont think necessarily that its additive to our overall strategy i dont think it generates incremental revenue particularly and our focus is really on delivering the product having the best service and the best pipeline to deliver whatever anybody wants to buy from us or from overthetop providers so i dont see the mobile content strategy as being one that would really be critical to us to our overall approach james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer i think that the mobile carriers are trying to differentiate themselves because they dont have much to differentiate themselves i mean thats why theyre investing in that kind of thing but i think its really all about mobile revenue right its not about a new product set its about winning the battle against a competitor for them benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc yes makes sense brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer so ben on the payperview question that fight was actually the most successful payperview that we ever had so it did have a meaningful contribution on revenue i think on a aocf basis it contributed about  million of aocf during the quarter were also quite pleased that with all the enhancements that weve put in the network that we didnt have any customer service issues in dealing with the huge interest that was in that fight benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from marci ryvicker of wells fargo marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thanks i have two jim when you talked about verizon at the beginning you often get asked on these calls if theres been any change in competition and normally the answer is no so when you come out with such a strong commentary is it that competition is actually getting easier i mean fios didnt put up the best numbers or is cablevision just that much stronger thats the first question and then the second question do you envision as video subs go down whatever it is  or  that you can make all of that up in highspeed data pricing and tiers or is it your vision that at some point youre in a – or the industry is in a secular decline thanks james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer okay the first one was about – im getting old im sorry what was the first question about brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer verizon james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer thats right verizon kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director verizon james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer oh yes no thank you great i turned  this year thats my excuse i really see cablevision having over the last three years focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business and we saw ourselves back three years ago four years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company which is really a monopoly i know that some in the industry dont like to call themselves that but if youre the only provider that sort of makes you the monopoly were clearly not the only provider in our marketplace and it was time for us to recognize that but just recognizing it doesnt change you overnight its taken us a good  years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we address the realities of the marketplace what i said today is a reflection of cablevisions strength and i think the numbers bear that out quite nicely and i expect that we will get only stronger as a competitor and so thats really the basis of my comments on that other than that i think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that verizon continues to tout its fios product as being successful when we know very well that that is definitely not the case at least in our footprint and they refuse to break out their numbers and so they just sit there and beat their chest saying yes i am yes i am and everything that we see says no they arent so theres a little bit of that in there the second part of your question was on the bundle and the erosion of the bundle and i do see our ability actually to make up for loss of video customers but you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers by far in a way data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to  to  and so as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers i do expect that our suite of offerings to them will increase that therell be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use as well as expanded use and use by the way continues to grow exponentially and so the outlook for data is very strong and with video their margins continue to decrease and our intention is to ultimately be able to offer to our customers not only our video package but others videos packages versus an ip connection and further reduce our costs but improve the profitability of the company that way marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from craig moffett of moffettnathanson craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc hi jimmy i wonder if we could continue just with this same theme for a second as someone who is an owner of assets in the physical distribution business but also amcs content and msg sports how do you think about where value is going to be created in the value chain within the assets that you own and how is that evolving as you start to think about skinny bundles on your side of the distribution business james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer hi craig hey craig let me ask you a favor please right only my mother calls me jimmy so i appreciate if you call me jim craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc you got it jim james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer right and as far as the value chain today is a call about cablevision right i will be doing a call about madison square garden i think later in the month but i think the value equation here is just what i just said in my last answer i mean its in the data services its in the – we have gone over the last  years from a point where our customers valued video as the – that was the most important product and that was the decisive product in terms of choosing providers now its data and its connectivity and its not just connectivity to the home but its wireless connectivity and the ability to offer products and services in both areas in both at home and mobiley is where were focusing and along with that i think that we will be able to distinguish ourselves to separate ourselves from our competitors and be able to charge a premium for services that really only we provide craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc can i ask a followup question about your  to  ratio that you said for the value of customers whats the solution to that is it to say were going to be very selective for which customers within video we take or is it to say were going to reprice video in order to ensure that for the customers that we have that its profitable or is it simply to shift away from video and pare back expenses including potentially dropping some programming in order to sort of rightsize the cost side of the video equation james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer i dont know about the programming part craig but video is turning into if it isnt already the milk eggs and bread of the convenience store you have to have them right the customer wants them right but its not as i said before its not the most important product right data is the most important product but if you just offer data alone right the other providers who offer video would capture the customer because you have to sell milk bread and eggs along with everything else in the back of the store now we by far in a way have the best back of the store and the milk bread and eggs should just need to make sure they stay fresh and theyre equal to whats available out there and to what the most customers want so that means you dont have to carry every service its – you dont have to be on the cutting edge of every technology that has to do with video because customers dont necessarily always want those you can keep your cost down and you can try and maintain some level of margin right but over the long run its the back of the store thats going to make you profitable craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc thats helpful thanks jim operator thank you your next question comes from amy yong of macquarie amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc thanks i wanted to focus a little bit more on the cord cutting packages i know its early days but are there any take rates that you can talk to for hulu and hbo and i think kristin you mentioned in your earlier comments that most customers are still taking the tripleplay package so are these cord cutting packages just drumming up call center volumes or are people actually taking them and if they are is it because of economic or generational shifts in viewing thank you kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director so yes just to repeat amy what i said before you are correct they do make the phone ring the bulk of people are being upsold into tripleproduct bundles we do see like i said acquisitions so millennials are definitely interested in cord cutting packages and were actually happy on the lower end cord cutting package that were allowing people in more financially conservative situations to have access to internet and to broadcast television and to kind of go back a little bit to craigs question about expense we are able to see too that the broadbandonly customers require much lower level of service from us they call us less and our need to roll trucks against them are less so combining those two things were very positive on the opportunity to sell this type of package but its really – its fringe its people that we havent had before and again the attractiveness of it makes the phone ring but again to the breadandeggs model when people do call and we say okay in order to get that price these are the programming services youll get and when they see that theyre missing a lot of their core fundamental cable tv content they much prefer to go to a more traditional television package amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc great and then you mentioned that capex is going to bump up in the back half can you just speak to the magnitude of the bumpup and where are the bigger buckets of capex spend at this point looks like cpe and scalable infrastructure actually went down in the quarter so just wondering what youre actually investing in brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer so just as a comment our guidance for the year is that capex spending is expected to be substantially similar to what it was last year and so i think what youve seen in terms of lower capex this quarter yeartodate is more just timing of projects timing of cpe purchases and so we still expect to for total capex spending to be comparable to last year i think relative to why were lower relative to last year as examples we had higher investment in scalable infrastructure last year as we were doing investments in our cloud dvr services where weve had lower of that this year relative to first quarter why it being up basically its timing its settop box purchases and just higher spending on overall bandwidth augmentation to support the higher speeds that we put in place amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from michael morris of guggenheim partners michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc thank you good morning guys my question is about how you think about the overthetop offerings from companies that you pay for the same content so an example not specific to this but an example would be cbs all access where their overthetop product looks extremely similar to what you pay retransmission fees for so i guess generally speaking for these types of offerings do your agreements allow for this i know you dont speak to specific agreements but just generally is this something you feel the need or you try to protect yourself against when you do go into an agreement and in the future if somebody launches something like this do you expect more flexibility with respect to being able to maybe tier those networks or drop them from the bundle how do you think about that dynamic in terms of protecting your own investment in the programming thanks james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer well first off our focus first and foremost is the customer and we dont believe that anywhere in our task is directing the customer one way or another so when cbs comes out with an overthetop package et cetera right thats more choice for our customer right theyre still going to use our service to get it and so we really dont have that much difficulty with that and there are plenty of others that are doing overthetop services too remember if you heard earlier i mean the video product itself is what our biggest concern is that the customer have available to them a video product that they like at a price that they can afford and so whether they get that through our big bundle or whether they get that through our cord cutter package which allows them to get for instance cbs for free to us whats most important is that theyre satisfied and we focus on providing the best connectivity to them so they can access all of those products but we dont see ourselves as trying to stop the flow of overthetop programming to our customers that isnt something that were very interested in doing and what was the other part of your question or was there michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc well maybe ill ask the question more bluntly lets take something like espn which is obviously an expensive programming cost for you james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer right michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc and theyre talking about at some point going overthetop so if they launch an overthetop service would you expect to still pay full price for that in your most broadly distributed bundle or would you say if youre going to make that available direct perhaps we should at least be able to tier it out of our most basic package or give our customers more options james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer no we dont think like that its basically its the same answer i mean look if espn does offers an overthetop service right and one of our customers takes the espn overthetop service right then the likelihood is that theyre not a bundle subscriber right theyre more like the – theyre for sure going to be a data subscriber because theyre going to need the connectivity especially for that kind of programming right and they could very well have the digital antenna et cetera and theyre still our customer and thats what we want remember its on a per customer basis that espn charges so as long as theyre pricing – if they underprice us and go to the consumer with a lesser price than what theyre getting from us which by the way i cant imagine why they would do that because theyre just decreasing their overall revenue right but if they did that i could see us possibly going back to them and saying hey look you know we need to at least even up here but other than that we dont have a problem with it because for us its not about capturing the video customer its about connectivity and we ultimately expect that customers will be getting – a good portion of our customers will be getting their video product from overthetop it may take five years to  years but that is the way things are going to happen and we think that what we really want the customer to think is that the best way to get that the very best way to get that is with cablevision by using our connectivity product michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc thats very helpful thanks jim james lawrence dolan  executive chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator thank you your next question comes from phil cusick of jpmorgan philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks two if i may first its nice to see rgus do better im curious how much of that strength you think is seasonal versus more sustainable and if you could talk about the seasonality of the business overall especially your more seasonal secondhome market im curious if youve seen the seasonality of video connects in q and q disconnects fade as well as seeing a less seasonal variation in hsd as people keep these homes lit up with broadband year round kristin a dolan  chief operating officer  director so id just say to that overall the impact of seasonality on our business has really declined over the last few years so i wouldnt say its completely flat but the peaks and valleys have definitely have gotten smaller over the years so we dont see it as a huge impact we do see fewer moves this year than anticipated but really our overall – what makes us happy is just the level of voluntary churn and being at such a significant low but the seasonality i think plays less and less of an impact over time philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then second at the risk of using myself as an example as a cablevision customer ive been surprised by the difference in quality of netflix and hbo now where i get a lot of buffering on hbo almost none on netflix i assume its because netflix has a direct connection into your network is there any momentum to do this with others like hulu or hbo or others and when could your network be ready for a fully functional overthetop partnership that jim alluded to wilt hildenbrand  senior advisor cablevision systems corp its wilt well netflix certainly has a direct connect and that is one of the benefits although the benefits of direct connect takes the internet out of the equation and just uses our local network right the pipe going through your house to deliver the service why hbo would be working any less than netflix we might want to check out your house the drop to your house or your house itself because theres no endemic reason for it to be that way if netflix is running well on the local area network then hbo and everything else should be running just as well i mean netflix there is the barometer so i think you might have something going on in your neighborhood because it shouldnt be any different would you like to give us your phone number and street address philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc ill give it right here on the line thank you guys cindi buckwalter  senior vice presidentinvestor relations operator well take one more question please operator thank you your final question will come from james ratcliffe of buckingham research james m ratcliffe  the buckingham research group inc thanks for taking the question two on the cost structure if i could first of all you called out an increase in legal fees as a drain on aocf in the quarter can you give us some really to size that and if thats expected to be recurring stepup or a onetime and secondly if we look at the other category any way to break out how much of the aocf deficit there is really driven by the businesses in that category and how much is corporate overhead thanks brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer so on the legal fees higher legal fees that were seeing this year are just related to matters that were dealing with relative to programmers labor false advertising et cetera were not going to give any guidance on that thats part of being in a competitive environment and our environment with the programmers relative to your question on deficit in the aocf gregg g seibert  vice chairman the other category brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer in the other category i think more of that increase is probably on the – hold on one second gregg g seibert  vice chairman its not corporate overhead thats what hes asking no its the other james m ratcliffe  the buckingham research group inc im just asking if theres a way to sort of break up that aocf deficit between the sort of the businesses where the revenues included in other and otherwise on unallocated costs brian g sweeney  president and chief financial officer no i dont think theres no real – i think each of them had small components of it theres not one thats overwhelming relative to the others james m ratcliffe  the buckingham research group inc all right thank you gregg g seibert  vice chairman thank you very much operator thank you this does conclude todays conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on

their respective leagues controversies new york knicks like the rangers the knicks performed abysmally in the early s and have yet to recover which fans mostly blame on dolans management missteps although the knicks made the nba finals in  they have not posted a winning season until the  season furthermore the knicks had not made the playoffs from the  season to the  season which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the knicks dolan has come under fire from many knicks fans for the teams run of consecutive losing seasons from  to  numerous mediawho and informal fan polls including a recent sports illustrated poll have ranked dolan the worst owner in the nba in  nba commissioner david stern criticized dolans management of the knicks saying theyre not a model of intelligent management one widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard allan houston a year  million maximum contract in  when no other team had offered houston more than  million houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over  million remaining on his contract in  dolan hired isiah thomas as team president of basketball operations and general manager to replace embattled executive scott layden thomas made aggressive moves to retool and upgrade the knicks roster through trades the nba draft and free agency despite the talent thomas imported the team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the target of the frustration of knick fans dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of knicks fans for his commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions after the  season the knicks signed head coach larry brown to a year  million contract after just one losing season brown was fired and the team boughtout browns contract for  million brown walked away with a total of  million for coaching the knicks for just one year after firing larry brown isiah thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the knicks during a staged interview on msg network which is the last time dolan answered questions from the media dolan gave thomas an ultimatum to show evident progress or potentially be fired in the latter half of the  season with the knicks within reach of a playoff spot dolan signed thomas to a multiyear contract extension the team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of thomas contract the next season dolan stripped thomas of his front office duties because thomas had taken the knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure new team president donnie walsh removed thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season other coaches that also had shortlived tenures as head coaches of the knicks include don chaney – and lenny wilkens – like thomas and brown they remained on the knicks payroll following their departure from the bench due to multiyear contracts signed with the owner and in chaneys case  separate contract extensions in  dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former knicks executive anucha brownesanders brownesanders accused dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from isiah thomas the court ruled in favor of brownsanders and dolan had to pay  million of the  million settlement msg was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement in july  dolan faced criticism for allowing popular knicks point guard jeremy lin to sign with the houston rockets without matching their  million offer in february  dolan responded to a letter from irving bierman a yearold lifelong knicks fan that criticized dolans ownership of the knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own telling the fan to root for the nets because the knicks dont want you and that bierman was a sad person and probably an alcoholic maybe dolan later addressed the issue with the press but did not apologize only saying the letter was a case of tit for tat and declaring the incident over newly appointed nba commissioner adam silver did not reprimand or penalize dolan but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling dolan a consummate new yorker” who received an unkind email and responded with an unkind email” on february   former knicks player charles oakley was removed from madison square garden during a knicks–clippers game following an altercation with msg security oakley contends that dolan has ignored if not ostracized him new york rangers after winning the stanley cup in  the rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of dolans increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the  season until the – nhl lockout despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years this was the longest playoff drought in the franchises history in part due to questionable expensive freeagent signings such as eric lindros pavel bure and theo fleury despite fan and media calls for the teams general manager glen sather to be fired for the organizations shortcomings sather was retained however since the resolution of the nhl lockout in  dolan has allowed sather to rebuild from the ground up which has led to a revival of the club and the organization culminating with a trip to the eastern conference finals in  their first since  however when dolan spoke of the teams stanley cup chances in january  rangers head coach john tortorella took issue with his remarks i have my owner up here talking about a stanley cup thats a bunch of bullshit tortorella said in response we need to take it one game at a time new york liberty on may   dolan announced that isiah thomas would serve as president of the wnba’s liberty considering thomas history being both a failed presidentgm of the knicks and thomas being implicated in the anucha brownesanders sexual harassment incident it was questioned by many fans and members of the press media policies dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with msg network in  dolan instituted media training for all garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media under dolans watch msg implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and knicks beat writers from interviewing players without an msg public relations official present forbidding oneonone interviews and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization the policies also forbid the msg network from being critical of the knicks and the rangers regardless of their performance such measures were not standard practice for other nba teams in addition the knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press in  longtime broadcaster marv alberts contract was not renewed by

this deadly disease with dolans backing cablevision also uses its assets to advance the curepc campaign aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer and is responsible for organizing the holiday rock  roll bash the foundations biggest annual fundraiser dolan also led msgs response to local and national tragedies he played a principal role in organizing the recent  benefit concert which raised an initial  million for the victims of hurricane sandy with additional money still coming in other extraordinary benefit concerts have included the concert for new york city which generated more than  million in aid for  victims and heroes and from the big apple to the big easy which raised nearly  million for hurricane katrina relief dolan also supports msgs ongoing commitment to the community particularly through the garden of dreams foundation the nonprofit charity that partners with msg to help children facing obstacles throughout the new york metropolitan area sports management in  paramount communications the owner of madison square garden was acquired by viacom who in turn sold the msg properties to cablevision and itt corporation which had  ownership each itt sold its share to cablevision three years later in  dolan was given an increased role in managing cablevisions sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets the teams under his domain include most notably the national basketball associations new york knicks the national hockey leagues new york rangers the womens national basketball associations new york liberty and the american hockey leagues hartford wolf pack as chairman of madison square garden he supervises daytoday operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks which include msg network and msg plus he also serves as a governor of the knicks and rangers to their respective leagues controversies new york knicks like the rangers the knicks performed abysmally in the early s and have yet to recover which fans mostly blame on dolans management missteps although the knicks made the nba finals in  they have not posted a winning season until the  season furthermore the knicks had not made the playoffs from the  season to the  season which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the knicks dolan has come under fire from many knicks fans for the teams run of consecutive losing seasons from  to  numerous mediawho and informal fan polls including a recent sports illustrated poll have ranked dolan the worst owner in the nba in  nba commissioner david stern criticized dolans management of the knicks saying theyre not a model of intelligent management one widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard allan houston a year  million maximum contract in  when no other team had offered houston more than  million houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over  million remaining on his contract in  dolan hired isiah thomas as team president of basketball operations and general manager to replace embattled executive scott layden thomas made aggressive moves to retool and upgrade the knicks roster through trades the nba draft and free agency despite the talent thomas imported the team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the target of the frustration of knick fans dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of knicks fans for his commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions after the  season the knicks signed head coach larry brown to a year  million contract after just one losing season brown was fired and the team boughtout browns contract for  million brown walked away with a total of  million for coaching the knicks for just one year after firing larry brown isiah thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the knicks during a staged interview on msg network which is the last time dolan answered questions from the media dolan gave thomas an ultimatum to show evident progress or potentially be fired in the latter half of the  season with the knicks within reach of a playoff spot dolan signed thomas to a multiyear contract extension the team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of thomas contract the next season dolan stripped thomas of his front office duties because thomas had taken the knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure new team president donnie walsh removed thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season other coaches that also had shortlived tenures as head coaches of the knicks include don chaney – and lenny wilkens – like thomas and brown they remained on the knicks payroll following their departure from the bench due to multiyear contracts signed with the owner and in chaneys case  separate contract extensions in  dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former knicks executive anucha brownesanders brownesanders accused dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from isiah thomas the court ruled in favor of brownsanders and dolan had to pay  million of the  million settlement msg was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement in july  dolan faced criticism for allowing popular knicks point guard jeremy lin to sign with the houston rockets without matching their  million offer in february  dolan responded to a letter from irving bierman a yearold lifelong knicks fan that criticized dolans ownership of the knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own telling the fan to root for the nets because the knicks dont want you and that bierman was a sad person and probably an alcoholic maybe dolan later addressed the issue with the press but did not apologize only saying the letter was a case of tit for tat and declaring the incident over newly appointed nba commissioner adam silver did not reprimand or penalize dolan but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling dolan a consummate new yorker” who received an unkind email and responded with an unkind email” on february   former knicks player charles oakley was removed from madison square garden during a knicks–clippers game following an altercation with msg security oakley contends that dolan has ignored if not ostracized him new york rangers after winning the stanley cup in  the rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of dolans increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the  season until the – nhl lockout despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years this was the longest playoff drought in the franchises history in part due to questionable expensive freeagent signings such as eric lindros pavel bure and theo fleury despite fan and media calls for the teams general manager glen sather to be fired for the organizations shortcomings sather was retained however since the resolution of the nhl lockout in  dolan has allowed sather to rebuild from the ground up which has led to a revival of the club and the organization culminating with a trip to the eastern conference finals in  their first since  however when dolan spoke of the teams stanley cup chances in january  rangers head coach john tortorella took issue with his remarks i have my owner up here talking about a stanley cup thats a bunch of bullshit tortorella said in response we need to take it one game at a time new york liberty on may   dolan announced that isiah thomas would serve as president of the wnba’s liberty considering thomas history being both a failed presidentgm of the knicks and thomas being implicated in the anucha brownesanders sexual harassment incident it was questioned by many fans and members of the press media policies dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with msg network in  dolan instituted media training for all garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media under dolans watch msg implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and knicks beat writers from interviewing players without an msg public relations official present forbidding oneonone interviews and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization the policies also forbid the msg network from being critical of the knicks and the rangers regardless of their performance such measures were not standard practice for other nba teams in addition the knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press in  longtime broadcaster marv alberts contract was not renewed by msg network allegedly because of his criticism of the knicks play references  james

ceo of cablevision james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director thank you cindi and good morning cablevision delivered strong financial results in  while continuing to transform the optimum experience we developed higher quality customer relationships by offering products and services that provide superior value provided expanded connectivity inside and outside the home and enhancing the performance of our network our full year  financial results reflect our progress total company net revenue increased nearly  and aocf increased by  compared with  our capital expenditures were  million  lower than  full year  free cash flow was  million and we declared a  per share quarterly dividend on february  our fourth quarter net customer results compared favorably with the third quarter we added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint we also significantly reduced the loss of our customer relationships even in our most competitive areas our results reflect a decrease in move and nonpay related churn versus the third quarter during the fourth quarter we continued to deliver strong yearoveryear growth in revenue per customer disciplined approaches to pricing promotional eligibility and customer credit policies are key elements of our strategy while these policies reduce the number of our available sales opportunities we believe they contribute to a stronger base of customers over time we plan to continue these policies in  while differentiating the value of optimum in the marketplace during  we introduced several new products and enhancements let me mention some of them of the more notable initiatives we introduced two new optimum online speed tiers we enhanced our tv to go video experience by integrating more than  networks into the optimum app we improved our multiroom dvr by increasing simultaneous recordings to  shows we also signed our first advertising clients to our new data and analytics service in addition to these product enhancements we continued to improve our customer service activity  total customer service phone calls declined by nearly  trouble call truck rolls declined  each as compared with  these achievements reflect the contributions of our nearly  employees in  we continued to invest in our people and transform our culture to one that is more performancebased we did this through new recognition training and development programs as well as a new nonexecutive performance bonus plans and finally lets discuss our wifi initiatives in  we launched our newest wifi smart router we also surpassed our goal of reaching more than  million optimum wifi access points within our service area we continued to see remarkable growth in our optimum wifi usage during the fourth quarter our customers used more than four times the amount of data than during the fourth quarter of  wifi is a critical part of our product strategy and one of our most important strategic assets as i have noted before we plan to continue to innovate in this area which brings me to freewheel our most recent effort to monetize our investment in wifi freewheel is the first allwifi device from a cable provider it is available nationwide and delivers unlimited data talk and text it works anywhere in the world where you are connected to wifi freewheel is backed by our carriergrade optimum wifi network with  million hotspots in the tristate area today optimum wifi customers pass an average of more than  gigabytes of data per month that is nearly three times more data than the most commonly purchased data plans from cellular providers against this backdrop we believe freewheel will be the beginning of a disruptive force to the cellular industry as a company we are solidifying our position as our customers preferred connectivity company freewheel is a natural progression of this strategy it is the first in a series of new products and services which we intend to launch in order to better serve our customers needs for three years we have been improving our relationships with our customers today service quality has become a key differentiator of the optimum experience and we remain committed to being the best service provider in the industry in  as we continue this important work we expect to introduce additional innovative products and repackage certain of our current offerings our goal is to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving demands of our customers with that i will now turn the call over to gregg seibert gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer well thank you jim and good morning total company fourth quarter net revenue increased  and aocf declined by  as compared with the prioryear period capital expenditures were  million compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  fourth quarter free cash flow was  million during the quarter we gained nearly  net highspeed data customers customer relationships and voice customers both decreased by  and video customers declined by  fourth quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by nearly  to  as compared with the prioryear period this increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and higher advertising revenue fourth quarter total cable revenue increased by  reflecting the increase in revenue per customer which was partially offset by fewer customer relationships as compared with  fourth quarter cable advertising revenue increased by  driven primarily by increased political and issuerelated spending this growth was offset in part by lower banking and leisure spending our audience data and addressable advertising campaigns contributed to this growth and we are successfully attracting new national advertisers with our advanced advertising and measurement capabilities cable aocf declined  in the fourth quarter as compared with the prioryear period this primarily reflects the impact of fewer customers and higher programming employeerelated and marketing costs as well as higher legal expenses and other fees this was partially offset by revenue growth and lower costs associated with the decline in trouble call related truck rolls and customer service calls cables fourth quarter aocf margin was  full year  aocf margin was  slightly higher than the prior year period comparable margin of  cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was  million a  million increase from the same period in  this increase reflects the timing of cpe purchases and higher spending on wifi and support capital total cable capital spending for  was approximately  lower than the comparable  level aocf and capital expenditures for the fourth quarter reflect modest prelaunch investments in freewheel lightpaths fourth quarter revenue increased  and aocf increased  over the prioryear period these increases reflect revenue growth in ethernetbased services partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy tdmbased services during  lightpaths network expanded to approximately  buildings an increase of  connections lightpath also added gigabit optical transport services and managed video conferencing to its suite of products lightpaths expanding product portfolio and nearly ubiquitous footprint continue to present us with a great opportunity to grow into the mid and large enterprise space in our other segment fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat and the aocf deficit improved by  these results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at news  partially offset by lower advertising revenue at newsday aocf also reflects reduced expenditures at certain other businesses we continue to focus on transforming the optimum experience and strengthening our position as the markets premier connectivity company by investing in our network products and employees while continuing to respond to the evolving marketplace with innovative products such as freewheel looking forward to  we currently anticipate that total company aocf and capex including incremental expenditures for freewheel will be substantially similar to our  results however this is a dynamic business and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses now turning to the companys financial position the companys fourth quarter consolidated cash position was  million and net debt was  billion we had  billion undrawn and available under the  billion revolving credit facility at csc holdings as of the end of  during  we executed a number of successful financing transactions which extended our maturities strengthened our balance sheet and improved our strong liquidity position while funding our quarterly dividend we plan to apply our  free cash flow in a similar manner in may we issued  million of  senior notes due  at par which was the lowest bond issuance coupon in the companys history the net proceeds and a portion of our cash on hand were used to repay  million of our term loan b credit facility later in the year csc holdings made a  million voluntary repayment of its term loan b facility this transaction results in cash interest savings over the remaining term of the facility as well as improving our debt maturity profile by reducing our  debt maturities we also used cash on hand to opportunistically repurchase approximately  million of cablevision senior notes this was executed at an average price below par and will generate cash interest savings over the term of the notes at december  the companys consolidated net leverage ratio was  times the csc holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was  times in calculating our total company leverage ratio aocf is determined using latest quarter annualized aocf as a result our leverage ratios are more sensitive to changes in quarterly aocf than they would be if our leverage was measured based on trailing month aocf we did not repurchase shares of cablevision stock during  we have approximately  million of remaining stock repurchase authorization finally in june charter communications reached a settlement with the montana department of revenue related to a property tax dispute that was originally litigated during our ownership of bresnan communications as a result during the fourth quarter we received substantially all of the approximately  million in cash that we expect to receive from charter as a result of this settlement operator were now prepared to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and your first question comes from marci ryvicker of wells fargo marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thanks two questions first gregg can you just clarify when you talk about aocf and capex being similar in  and  are you talking about an absolute basis or growth gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer well im talking about absolute numbers marci and i think as we look to the  guidance as everybody on this call is aware we manage this business on a longterm basis were not managing it for quarterly earnings and one of the things thats very important to us is to be able to manage the business in a dynamic fashion jim alluded to the fact that were considering additional new products this year and while we have nothing to announce today what were trying to do is provide guidance that  very thoughtful guidance last year we got a tiny bit of criticism for the fact that we were conservative in our guidance im not saying that were conservative in the guidance for  but again rather thoughtful as we look at aocf percentage changes  percentage point change in aocf is roughly  million thats a relatively small amount when youre talking about numbers for the magnitude that this business generates so from our perspective were optimistic about  but we are going to update the guidance as we go through the year and were comfortable looking at aocf and capital being substantially similar to where they came in in  marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thank you for that and then my followup is for jim you mentioned in your opening comments the competitive environment which i think you probably mention every quarter is there anything that youre seeing thats different now either in the fourth quarter going into the first quarter thanks james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director from the point of view you mean of competition i mean our competitor hasnt changed theyre not competing any more than they were competing before or any less than they were competing before so no i guess theres not much of a change marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from mike mccormack of jefferies michael l mccormack  jefferies llc hey guys thanks gregg just if you could think more about on the capex side youve had pretty elevated cpe with some of the project work youve been undertaking and not to sort of shed light on what  projects look like but i guess were sort of looking and saying why shouldnt that be a lower number in  and then if you could maybe just a comment on cash taxes for  gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer sure lets start with the cash tax comment thankfully we have bonus depreciation again so i do not anticipate that well run through the nol in  so cash taxes will be quite light yet again in terms of the capital side of the equation mike you call out the cpe number we had an increase in cpe in the fourth quarter but a lot of what happens with cpe as you know is timing of expenditures we ended up with additional purchases of boxes of managed routers some remotes in the fourth quarter but its not necessarily cpe that will keep capital expenditures sort of roughly these levels we continue to invest in wifi we continue acrosstheboard to invest in our network and were going to continue those efforts as youll recall from a few years ago there was a period where we didnt feel the plant was up to the capability it needed to be up to but thats not going to – as we said many times thats not going to happen again were going to keep the level of investment up to a point where we can truly realize this ambition of being the premier connectivity company in the new york marketplace michael l mccormack  jefferies llc great gregg im sorry just on the other thing on the sga looks like a pretty good sequential increase is there seasonality there and maybe just if you could size up the employeerelated impact thatd be great gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer well what id actually do is – want to talk just a tiny bit about the gross margin items in the quarter because we had a couple of items that jump off the sheet which youll see in the k because for example our cable recurring revenue was up  million in the quarter our programming costs were up  million so you would normally expect more of a margin improvement under that type of scenario but we had  million of severance in the quarter severance in the fourth quarter of  was below the aocf line item because of the fact that we had a formal restructuring this year its not so thats a  million delta and advertising expense was up by  million yearoveryear some of that was related to the freewheel launch and those two items and some additional fees associated with the launch of freewheel had an impact on the quarter so those were sort of the bigger items there was some increase in compensation cost but thats something that happens fairly frequently in the fourth quarter as we true up the ultimate incentive programs to the actual results for the year michael l mccormack  jefferies llc great good luck on the new role gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from jessica reif cohen with bank of america merrill lynch jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch i have three if thats okay the first is for jim gregg and kristin jim you said at the beginning of the call that wifi is one of your most important strategic assets obviously youre starting with freewheel can you give us your longer term like how youre thinking about things over the longer term james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director you mean about wifi or just overall about the company jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch well if you want to do both thats fine i meant specifically wifi because you said it was one of the most important strategic assets james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director okay sure wifi is connectivity and connectivity on a wireless basis and what were seeing in the marketplace and what we believe is the for lack of a better term the wave of the future is more and more and more reliance on wifi by our customers because their use of data is going up but also for instance if you went to the consumer electronics show this year i dont think there was hardly anything on the floor that wasnt connected using a wifi device i didnt see one thing by the way being connected using a cellular device all of this tells us that connectivity particularly on a wireless basis is going to become more and more important to our consumers we want to be the company that provides that connectivity we want to be the company thats seen as being the best at providing that connectivity now we think that thats sort of the first part of the wave the second part is that there are products and services that will go along with that strategic position the first of which youve just seen which is freewheel but there will be others and we feel that we will be poised and ready to take advantage of the strategic position that weve created by investing in wifi in order to do that so other than that from the company point of view i would say that the other thing that we see which is really very closely related is that connectivity has surpassed video as the primary product for a company like ours and we need to continue to strategize our product offerings to reflect that with different packaging et cetera which is something i think we will do in  jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch great and then one for gregg gregg just a little more specific but you mentioned that there was an increase in the buildout i think you said  buildings is there a way that you can size how big the opportunity – as you continue to increase buildings is there like a potential market size that you can address gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer on the lightpath side jessica the building count matters a lot but it matters in two directions one of the – when i first started working closely with dave pistacchio who runs lightpath a couple of years ago one of the key attributes of the business at that point in time was that we were spending roughly  in capital for every dollar of revenue that we were generating and i think that we had a very high aocf margin in that business which was great but when youre putting so much back into capital the free cash flow profile of the business is not as attractive as the free cash flow profile is in cable and one of the things that we were doing was we were lighting a lot of additional buildings and not getting the same type of sellthrough or at least sort of targetedtype of sellthrough for additional tenants in already wired buildings so i think what dave and his team are doing now is they are selectively lighting new buildings when they have a new anchor tenant but one of the reasons the margins have been expanding particularly the cash flow margin in that business has been the fact that were doing a better job of making sure that were marketing through secondary tenants in those buildings we dont have to light a new building in the lightpath business in order to generate incremental revenue the cash flow characteristics of that account become substantially better id argue lots of growth opportunity for lightpath we mentioned some of the new managed services theyre providing and lots of room in the footprint its still a very fragmented business of which we have a minority share and my expectation is that were going to keep building that share jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch great and then the last one for kristin so you guys – obviously its an advertising question i just was wondering if you could give us some color on the progress youve had in selling data and how willing are advertisers to use that data versus say nielsen and i guess the second part of the question would be youve been building and building and building targeted advertising where do you think you are in the process is it where you want to be or is there still like a runway kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director yes we continue to be very enthusiastic i think last quarter despite a decline in local tv ad markets of  our ad revenue grew by  so that is definitely something were enthusiastic about we view and a significant amount of development work and now that dibble is here and we think more about integrating more data like with we did with time warner cable and utilizing the analytics that we derived from that data to create new products and services we think theres a lot more room to grow i dont know if that answers your question jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch and then when youre selling the data like how willing are people to – how willing are your customers to use that versus lets say nielsen kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director i dont think i can speak directly to nielsen what i will say is the value of census level which is household data down to individual homes versus an extrapolation that we always talk about the fact that nielsen has  people meters in the entire new york metro footprint which doesnt even equates the amount of channels that we offer shows the big difference of us being able to monitor every single channel tuned in real time for every single settop across our entire footprint so if you look at  boxes to indicate activity versus  million settops i think you can kind of get a sense of why the advertisers are interested and why it matters gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer isnt it more important from the advertiser perspective than actually selling the data in terms of how youre optimizing packages for a lot of our customers and using up a lot of dayparts kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director yes gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer that otherwise wouldnt be used up kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director yeah the longtailed content nontraditional daypart the value of cable overall theres a lot of different tails to this and all of them are positive and were enthusiastic about all of them jessica jean reif cohen  bank of america merrill lynch okay great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from amy yong of macquarie amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc thanks two questions you spent a lot of time talking about wifi do you expect that you could actually increase your market share outside of the current footprint my second question is more for gregg as you look into  you gave a lot of aocf and free cash flow guidance at what point could you actually tap down on the buyback thanks gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer well ill take the buyback question first which is at this point in time we continue to have our  per share quarterly dividend thats a very attractive return of capital for our shareholders and at this point were looking at that really as the primary return of capital the additional free cash flow that we generated above and beyond dividend requirement last year was for the most part used for debt reduction and i think that were going to continue to be prudent in the way that we run our leverage and maturity profiles so i think that to the extent were generating free cash flow in excess of the dividend it is much more likely that you will see us use that free cash flow to pay down additional debt rather than to repurchase shares at this point but again if there was a market event if there was – well continue to be opportunistic and thats one of the reasons we keep the share repurchase program in place james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director as far as going outside of our footprint i assume youre talking about freewheel because as far as the network and the cable systems go we certainly have no plans to go out and overbuild anybody because we dont think they work but freewheel is available across the united states and actually across the world and we are seeing uses for the product outside of our footprint in fact kristin you want to talk about europe or kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director yeah so were seeing some interest – really enthusiastic interest from expats and from people who travel frequently outside the country because theyre able to maintain a us phone number they dont incur any roaming charges when theyre on wifi either in their hotel or particularly in the uk where theres a lot of wifi available and throughout europe so the idea of having a flat rate us sort of sat phone that they can use to conduct all their us business is one of the sort of interesting opportunities for us that weve uncovered as we started rolling out freewheel so we think theres more opportunity there particularly in europe and also in the caribbean amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jason bazinet of citi jason boisvert bazinet  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks i think you guys had about  million of federal gross nols at the end of  i was just wondering if you could update us on where those are at yearend  and then when do you expect to become a full cash taxpayer what year and is it important for you to either minimize or not pay sizeable federal income taxes in the long term thank you gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer okay jason so right now the balance of the nol is at  million i would have predicted at this time a year ago if i were making forecasts which i dont that the nol would be running out during  however once again weve got bonus depreciation this year which has extended our runway by an additional year and the question really becomes what does tax policy look like going forward will we get bonus depreciation again if we do my guess is that that would push the target out another year so right now my belief is that  well not have material cash taxes  is a little bit up in the air toward the end of the year but again well see what tax policy looks like as far as taxes are concerned its very straightforward a dollar that you pay in tax comes out of free cash flow and so what we do within the limits of the tax code is we aggressively manage our exposure and so far weve been quite successful in maintaining the free cash flow profile jason boisvert bazinet  citigroup global markets inc broker okay all right thank you operator thank you your next question comes from craig moffett of moffettnathanson craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc hi good morning two if i could first i guess jimmy or kristin can you just talk about how you think about strategically the push and pull of trying to balance margins on the one hand and trying to sustain subscriber growth on the other – or at least subscriber stability on the other and how you make those decisions and then second – first congratulations to both gregg and brian gregg could you just talk a little bit about your new role and what it is you hope to accomplish in the new role thats spanning the different organizations gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer jim or kristin would you like to go first james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director well this is jimmy kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director not kristy james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director right and im not quite sure i completely understand your question craig i mean do you want to know how we balance margin against subscriber craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc against subscriber growth how do you think about raising prices in a way that sustains your margins but may also hurt your subscriber metrics and how do you prioritize between those two things james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director well i mean we try and keep the margins right were trying to keep our expenses as low as possible and we think theres more opportunity in that but we are not willing to sacrifice any of our levels of service and in fact we think we can improve them and i think if you take a look at our performance over the last  months weve done exactly that as we transition from being what is a traditional cable company to a connectivity company we anticipate that our ability to reduce expenses will continue to increase except in the area of programming in the area of programming theres very little that a cable company can do to reduce its exposure in terms of increasing programming cost and theres no real way to continue – to pass that on to the customer in a competitive environment so i expect on the video side we will expect to see reducing margins primarily due to programming expense on the other side i expect that we will see increasing margins from the data side the good news is with that is that the consumer values the connectivity product more than they do the video product at this point and so thats roughly how we look at it im not sure that even answers your question but craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc no thats helpful thank you gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer good and craig from my perspective im obviously not going to speak for josh or for ted youll hear about their views as to the strategic landscape joshs tomorrow and i think ted just went through his on the msg call but from my perspective its an opportunity to continue to look at the ecosystem and the way that each of these three companies fits within a rapidly changing ecosystem its obviously not just the changes not just affecting cablevision and i felt very comfortable taking this new role because of the fact that we have a very experienced financial team here at cablevision youve met a number of the individuals as have many of the investors on this call its a great team i think brians leadership is going to be instrumental in making sure that this is a smooth transition but i also have to tell you im still going to be here jim and the board have asked me to continue to play a key role at cablevision working with the leadership team acrosstheboard on the companys financial and corporate strategy and additionally on investor relations so for some period of time youre going to be hearing my voice on these calls and at investor meetings and i look forward to continuing in that role craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc thats helpful thank you operator thank you your next question comes from ben swinburne of morgan stanley benjamin daniel swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning two questions one on freewheel and one on video jim you alluded to some new packaging i think on the video side in your prepared remarks but as you know the programmers sort of make you carry everything so just wondering if you have some color you can add to that how you might think about repackaging video and what the strategy is there in terms of addressing maybe a different kind of customer set than youve had in the past and then on the freewheel side all the carriers who just spent whatever it was  billion on spectrum would claim wifi has qos issues and handoff issues now that you have a product in the market can you talk about how the consumer experience is are you finding people are happy with the service and do you have a plan for handoff where wifi can become a true replacement for cellular in terms of moving around thanks james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director ill handle it i think kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director okay james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director if i need help so in terms of wifi i think its a little early on the customer experience we do have some early indications that customers are finding the product to do what we said it was going to do and that theyre enjoying it i hear a lot of anecdotal information from individual customers et cetera users of the product that we find very positive and reinforcing but i dont think were ready yet to start defining the user experience and we dont have enough metrics in the house yet to do that so – and see im trying – your other question benjamin daniel swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc just on video packaging how you think about changing that james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director okay yeah yeah yeah okay so i mean the thing about it is that the big shift here is what i said before the consumer would if given a choice they – you said you can either have your video product or you can have your data product right now almost overwhelmingly will take the data product and thats a pretty big shift particularly as we go out to the marketplace now as far as what the cellular companies are suggesting right in terms of handoffs et cetera we already do do handoffs but not over  miles an hour which basically means that if youre in a car going down the lie it wont help you there but were very upfront with that with the product and now i think pretty much everybody knows that about wifi and our anticipation is that the technology will continue to develop and i think that at some point even that will be included in the product set but i think the bigger indication and the one that cellular companies have to truly worry about is the one i talked about before nobodys building connectivity using cellular nobody everybody is using wifi and so why is that i think the answer to that is obvious right wifi is a much more efficient effective method of delivering data between a device a network and a server and so we can listen to the people who already invested their  billion defend why they invested their  billion but technology is technology science is science and this is what it is and i think that in my opinion the die is cast here benjamin daniel swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc yeah james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director so benjamin daniel swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc is there an opportunity on the video side to do smaller packages based on your contracts it seems like sort of skinny video or maybe some kind of hbo overthetop are you looking at any of those opportunities james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director look i dont want to let any cats out of the bag but i will tell you that were going to be very reactive to what we see what the consumer wants the consumer wants their connectivity first theyre a little less concerned right with what their video packages are and some of them would prefer to save money on those were going to be reactive to that and were going to continue to package our products so that we meet their needs and their demands more to come maybe the next call kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director may i just add one thing too if youre talking about qos think about qos on streaming video and compare your cellular experience to your wifi experience because thats what were chasing were not chasing qos on a phone call benjamin daniel swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc yeah thats very helpful thank you both operator thank you your next question comes from james ratcliffe of buckingham research james m ratcliffe  the buckingham research group inc good morning thanks for taking the question two if i could one is in housekeeping why did homes passed tick down in q is it something seasonal or anything else going on and secondly with all the debate around net neutrality i mean assuming the rules that are going into effect are in line with the chairmans comments and proposals from earlier this month is there anything you do differently in your business versus a world where we are continuing to have no net neutrality rules on the books thanks gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer yeah james ill address serviceable passings from time to time we do a review of our  millionplus serviceable passings to eliminate discrepancies and accurately depict our footprint the net decrease during the fourth quarter was just the result of that yearend review nothing more james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director and as far as net neutrality goes were never – i mean were like any other business the idea of more regulation is never great for us but to be honest we dont really see at least what the chairmans been discussing as having any real effect on our business so therefore were sort of neutral james m ratcliffe  the buckingham research group inc great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from phil cusick of jpmorgan philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks so im talking to you over a wifi phone please forgive me if it doesnt work but gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer sounds pretty good from here philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc it does right given your comments it sounds like you dont believe youll ever need cellular is that fair as a backup on that service james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director i dont know its certainly not in our plans at the moment right freewheel is a wifi product so i dont – were not going out after the voice market per se from that perspective so i mean kristin do you want to kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director yeah i mean as we keep saying its a product that has the data and also makes phone calls and texting but we did nearly  billion sessions over wifi in the fourth quarter and our average customer is utilizing more than  gigabits of data a month from where we sit data is what matters wifi was built for data and we dont see any indications that peoples thirst – aggressive thirst for data is going into decline so were planning for the future were not chasing as i said before were not chasing the cellular markets to be a mobile phone provider thats just not what the strategy for this product is about philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc got it gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer go ahead philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc and then given that – im sorry go ahead gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer no no no please philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc so given the capex budget is essentially flat should we look for that wifi rollout within the base to continue at essentially the  pace gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer i dont know that its flat i chose my words very specifically phil and i said substantially similar i wouldnt necessarily read flat into that i think our capital budget in  is just going to be dependent on what changes we opt to make in the business i think youll continue to see wifi buildout throughout it continues to be a core product for us but its going to be a dynamic budget and im not really comfortable breaking it into components at this point in the year philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc okay but given that wifi is now called a third of the base over just a little bit over a year that should still have a long way to go is that correct james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director i think you can certainly anticipate that theres going to be more proliferation of both private and public wifi hotspots i mean its part of the core strategy of the company youre going to see us continue to invest in the areas that will make connectivity even better for our customers clearly thats one of them so philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks guys james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director operator were going to take one more question operator thank you your final question comes from frank louthan of raymond james frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc great thank you just quickly so now that youre saying access is the most important product i assume that youre more inclined to support overthetop and just be more agnostic on that is that what we could expect to see a little bit more aggressively and then looking at the offer in lightpath what tactics are you using to get the additional tenants in the building thats been a little bit elusive for other fiber providers that have wiredup buildings how are you having success there where some of your competitors have not gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer i think what dave and his team are doing on the lightpath side is theyve made substantial changes in the sales organization there also have been substantial changes made in the incentive compensation or commission structure for the sales organization two years ago i would say that the bulk of our sales effort within lightpath was concentrated on long island were a long islandbased company and yet quite a bit of the growth was occurring in new jersey and connecticut been some pretty significant shifts there and as we have shifted resources from one part of the footprint to another part of the footprint weve also changed the structure changed the incentive changed the sales management and i think its all just basic blocking and tackling within the building so id love to tell you theres a specific silver bullet that could be applied across the industry but i really think its just that basic blocking and tackling that makes a difference james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director what was the other part of your question frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc well just being more agnostic as far as whether youre selling linear video versus overthetop products whether its your own product or others that are out there how should we think about your mix a couple years out james lawrence dolan  chief executive officer  director well the way the current trajectories are headed i would suggest that well probably be agnostic about the video and not about the connectivity kristin aigner dolan  chief operating officer  director i think to your question about access we already have  networks accessible through our optimum app our optimum app gets a ton of usage and the combination of the optimum app with any network thats allowing outofhome streaming is a total win and then when you combine that with the wifi backbone its really – thats the vision for us with our customers to access any product anywhere anytime within the footprint frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc great thank you thats very helpful gregg g seibert  vice chairman  chief financial officer thank

knicks like the rangers the knicks performed abysmally in the early s and have yet to recover which fans mostly blame on dolans management missteps although the knicks made the nba finals in  they have not posted a winning season until the  season furthermore the knicks had not made the playoffs from the  season to the  season which both ended in first round four game sweeps for the knicks dolan has come under fire from many knicks fans for the teams run of consecutive losing seasons from  to  numerous mediawho and informal fan polls including a recent sports illustrated poll have ranked dolan the worst owner in the nba in  nba commissioner david stern criticized dolans management of the knicks saying theyre not a model of intelligent management one widely criticized decision was to give shooting guard allan houston a year  million maximum contract in  when no other team had offered houston more than  million houston retired due to injury after just four seasons and with over  million remaining on his contract in  dolan hired isiah thomas as team president of basketball operations and general manager to replace embattled executive scott layden thomas made aggressive moves to retool and upgrade the knicks roster through trades the nba draft and free agency despite the talent thomas imported the team did not perform up to expectations and thomas was often the target of the frustration of knick fans dolan was also on the receiving end of the ire of knicks fans for his commitment to thomas in spite of thomas sometimes questionable decisions after the  season the knicks signed head coach larry brown to a year  million contract after just one losing season brown was fired and the team boughtout browns contract for  million brown walked away with a total of  million for coaching the knicks for just one year after firing larry brown isiah thomas assumed the duties of being the head coach of the knicks during a staged interview on msg network which is the last time dolan answered questions from the media dolan gave thomas an ultimatum to show evident progress or potentially be fired in the latter half of the  season with the knicks within reach of a playoff spot dolan signed thomas to a multiyear contract extension the team subsequently fell out of contention and dolan was castigated in many quarters for his extension of thomas contract the next season dolan stripped thomas of his front office duties because thomas had taken the knicks to the playoffs just once during his tenure new team president donnie walsh removed thomas as head coach upon the conclusion of the season other coaches that also had shortlived tenures as head coaches of the knicks include don chaney – and lenny wilkens – like thomas and brown they remained on the knicks payroll following their departure from the bench due to multiyear contracts signed with the owner and in chaneys case  separate contract extensions in  dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former knicks executive anucha brownesanders brownesanders accused dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from isiah thomas the court ruled in favor of brownsanders and dolan had to pay  million of the  million settlement msg was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement in july  dolan faced criticism for allowing popular knicks point guard jeremy lin to sign with the houston rockets without matching their  million offer in february  dolan responded to a letter from irving bierman a yearold lifelong knicks fan that criticized dolans ownership of the knicks and questioned his leadership with a seething letter of his own telling the fan to root for the nets because the knicks dont want you and that bierman was a sad person and probably an alcoholic maybe dolan later addressed the issue with the press but did not apologize only saying the letter was a case of tit for tat and declaring the incident over newly appointed nba commissioner adam silver did not reprimand or penalize dolan but instead further brushed the incident under the rug by calling dolan a consummate new yorker” who received an unkind email and responded with an unkind email” on february   former knicks player charles oakley was removed from madison square garden during a knicks–clippers game following an altercation with msg security oakley contends that dolan has ignored if not ostracized him new york rangers after winning the stanley cup in  the rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of dolans increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the  season until the – nhl lockout despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years this was the longest playoff drought in the franchises history in part due to questionable expensive freeagent signings such as eric lindros pavel bure and theo fleury despite fan and media calls for the teams general manager glen sather to be fired for the organizations shortcomings sather was retained however since the resolution of the nhl lockout in  dolan has allowed sather to rebuild from the ground up which has led to a revival of the club and the organization culminating with a trip to the eastern conference finals in  their first since  however when dolan spoke of the teams stanley cup chances in january  rangers head coach john tortorella took issue with his remarks i have my owner up here talking about a stanley cup thats a bunch of bullshit tortorella said in response we need to take it one game at a time new york liberty on may   dolan announced that isiah thomas would serve as president of the wnba’s liberty considering thomas history being both a failed presidentgm of the knicks and thomas being implicated in the anucha brownesanders sexual harassment incident it was questioned by many fans and members of the press media policies dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with msg network in  dolan instituted media training for all garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media under dolans watch msg implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and knicks beat writers from interviewing players without an msg public relations official present forbidding oneonone interviews and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization the policies also forbid the msg network from being critical of the knicks and the rangers regardless of their performance such measures were not standard practice for other nba teams in addition the knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press in  longtime broadcaster marv alberts contract was not renewed by msg network
