and a statement to the world every song holds its own and still holds up today i remember the album as a young kid but wasnt old enough to understand it fully now that i have it and i know the history behind it i have a new appreciation for it and why it was so big at the time and why george wanted to get away from his sex symbol image and all of the success it was too much for himread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsso good youll meltbyadrian cooperon december  format audio cdverified purchasegay or not this man has got oodles of freakin talent this album is amazing and beyond no matter how you look at it george produced wrote and composed all the tracks but one he cowrote look at your hands with producersongwriter david austin and there was absolutely no stopping him just coming off of the few years of success with wham from the early s with his old friend andrew ridgeley george michael decided he wanted to be taken a little more seriously and dropped this bombshell of a record it has some pop a lot of rb and funk overtones some dance tunes and ballads i swear its really diverse without being unfocused it rides by pretty smoothly and after its over you are likely to play it all againand i stand corrected as much as i loved corinne bailey raes masterpiece corinne bailey rae from  this album totally trumps it not only is this a damn fine album but it is my favorite from the s and favorite overall that ive heard so far great great vocal work production is amazing hardly sounding dated and george often comes off as a gentleman on these songs which is quite endearing starsdownloadkissing a foolfather figureone more tryi want your sex parts  hard dayhonorable mentionsi want your sex part read morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsfaith is the epitome of what good pop music isbygabeon july  format audio cdverified purchasethis album was nothing new when i bought it because i had already heard most of the tracks on the internet i liked the music so much that i decided to add it to my collectioni listen to this album a lot now and it is one of my favorite albums every track on this album compliments each other and it seems that there is no filler on this track list the arrangements the vocals the lyrics they are all molded into a soulpop masterpiece each track deserves its own recognitionfaith  this track is very simple but it is also very enjoyable it has a great guitar rhythm and a hook that is really catchyfather figure  this is one of my favorite tracks even though the lyrics may point towards a more discretionary and inappropriate affair i think it is a work of art and fits this album perfectly it has a way of showing that love can be dark and misunderstood and it matches the theme of the album it has religious allusions in the title but it goes on to a more human experiencei want your sex part   this track s fun you can dance to it it also maintains a subtle theme in the album i dont need a bible just look in my eyes its a clever catchy song with some new instruments brought in like horns to give it more of a funk feel i like it but it is not one of my favorites on the albumone more try  ill admit this track took a couple of times to get into it it seemed to be the same mellow and repetitive melody and vocals after awhile though i actually found it a really great track the lyrics are so powerful here listen to feel the sadness and request for redemption for yourselfhard day  i like this song a lot on itunes i tend to put it on playlists but sometimes it throws me off when i listen to the full album it just didnt seem to have many themes of religious allusions and topics that made the album really worth listening to as a wholelook at your hands  i feel that this is a very underrated track it is my second favorite on the album it has this nice ambient feel and the vocals are soft yet outstanding in my opinionmonkey  if you can get past the corny hook than it is actually a really fun track i really like the version on the music video but this was different on the album nonetheless great track having a monkey on your back means to me that there is a person who has an addiction whether it be drugs or a lover and though this monkey is harmful the attention that it demands is givenkissing a fool  i cant even begin to describe my admiration for this track it is my favorite the lyrics the music and the vocals it is all perfect the track maintains this lovely melody throughout and then it picks up and takes you up but just as it does it settles you back down everything seems timed so precisely it is a very good track and even of you dont buy the album which you should do at least get this track you wont regret ithard day  i could handle the track once and i dont mind it two times though as i said good song to shuffle in a playlist but in this album it just gets repetitive and awkward because it just doesnt fit with the rest of the tracks well it isnt a bad remix though there are not many differences from the originali want your sex part   it wasnt a bad way to end the album it is more subtle and sensual than parts  and  its actually a pretty good track its also good that parts  and  were separated because it could have gotten very boring but they avoided the problem welloverall it is a great album i really enjoy it and i recommend it to anyone who likes popsoul musicread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review

dressing room myhairboutique press products videos review of george michael  minute conditioner karen marie shelton date  introduction when it comes to george michaels gm hair care products my hair has a very long memory the gm products were the very first  that i used for the specific care and feeding of my budding long hair photo jeff hines  hairboutiquecom all rights reserved  a little history would probably help in  i made my way to a long hair specialist in dallas texas for help growing my overprocessed totally damaged broken hair  the specialist had studied with the great long hair expert george michael in his original new york shop  my specialist insisted that i buy and use all of the gm hair care products at that particular time the only gm products that were available for at home use was the orange colored cream shampoo the pink cream rinse and the  minute conditioner i was a very obedient long hair client  i faithfully used the gm products for almost two years  i have to confess even though i might get lynched by true blue gm fans the results were less than wonderful for my hair yes i know everyones hair is different and everyones hair will react differently  the product was just not the best for my hair even though i had disappointing results  i continued to use the products religiously at the urging of my dallas long hair consultant continued below ↓   advertisement switching from george michael  after two years had passed i decided that the gm products were just not working for me or my hair  i tried several other products including bain de terre giovanni and biolage  they all worked ok for awhile  the key was that i felt they were better than the gm products for my hair eventually i discovered aveda to the great joy of my hair immediately i became a devout aveda fan and never looked back i tucked my abandoned half empty bottles of the gm orange shampoo and pink cream rinse under my sink where it sat for years nestled next to the  minute conditioner although i never again used the products i am not exactly sure why i kept them  maybe i felt guilty throwing away gm products or maybe i just loved the picture of the longed hair lady on the outside of the bottle i was always fond of the gm orange and pink hair product colors  the orange cream shampoo reminded me of my favorite orangesicle ice cream treats that i enjoyed as a child  the pink cream rinse reminded me of those bright pink spongy hair rollers that are now mostly gone from the planet years went buy and gm products became just a distant memory until a trip to new york city three years ago returning to george michael in  in  i traveled to new york city on one of my regular hair product buying trip  as part of my hair pilgrimage i found my way to the original george michael salon on madison avenue although the shop was still fully operational george was long gone having sold his business to his partner maria photo jeff hines  hairboutiquecom all rights reserved  during my visit i decided that it was only fitting that i again purchase a bottle of the orange shampoo the pink cream rinse and the  minute conditioner after all i reasoned products constantly change  i figured that the shampoo cream rinse and conditioner had certainly been overhauled since the last time i abandoned them   i had bright new visions of a great new george michael relationship it was not to be the formulas as far as i could tell from comparing the new bottles with the old was unchanged  the effect on my very long hair was also unchanged i tried for two weeks to get my hair to fall in love with the gm products  after two weeks of rebellious hair i again tucked the new  versions under the bathroom sink next to the original s gm bottles  yep they were still there  i tend to suffer from packratitis please dont get me wrong  i have nothing but the utmost respect for george michael and his expertise for long hair  my hair just doesnt thrive under the gm products year   karen retries george michaels  minute conditioner maybe i am stubborn or maybe i am unwilling to give up on some things  recently my dear friend dave tichnor from the international long hair club interviewed george michael at his home in the south  once again there was a stirring in my bones to try the george michael products i had a good friend buy and ship me the  minute conditioner along with a fresh new  version bottle of the cream shampoo and cream rinse i decided to give all three of the products another concentrated effort with my hair i had high hopes that i could get some great results with the  minute conditioner  this product has always been touted to be a deep conditioning formula designed to add new life to long hair it is designed to be used as either a preconditioner or as for a more intensive  minute treatment  i compared my three different jars of  minute conditioner and alas there appeared to be no change from the s version to the  version some people would say that if you find something that works dont change it  others would say that you need to constantly refine and improve products coming from the engineering and software world i tend to believe that a product can always be improved  i admit that is my own prejudice and may not be the best opinion on the planet it just work for me salon application of  minute conditioner i have some interesting memories of my first every  minute conditioning treatment the very first time that my original long hair specialist applied the  minute conditioner he followed a very specific and detailed process  in fact i had to talk him into doing the conditioning treatment in his salon  he cautioned me that it took quite a long time and was a very involved process i bribed my long hair stylist with hot chinese carryout  that softened him to the point where i was able to convince him to apply the george michael treatment first he brushed all the tangles out of my hair and then washed my hair with the george michael orange colored cream shampoo  he applied two applications of the shampoo and then rinsed my hair with warm water after carefully towel blotting my hair he picked all the knots out very carefully  after removing the knots and tangles he very carefully separated my hair into approximately  inch sections and applied a generous glob of the  minute conditioner from root to end  then he pinned each section into a type of weird pin curl he carefully applied a good blob of conditioner to every inch of my hair being careful to avoid the scalp area once my entire head was heavily coated in the  minute conditioner he put a special plastic cap on my hair and then added a special heat retention cap on top of the plastic  my duty at that point was to sit under a hood dryer set on medium heat for one hour when he told me that i had to sit still for one hour i freaked  i am not one to hang out and do nothing for more than about  minutes even at starbucks after  minutes i start fidgeting and cleaning off the surrounding tables since i really wanted to give this treatment a fair shot i controlled my antsiness for a solid hour while my hair baked under the dryer   initial results when the timer went off he removed all the pin curls  then he washed my hair with the gm cream shampoo  he applied a generous amount of gm cream rinse two full warm water rinses and a final blast of artic cold water after carefully detangling my hair he rolled my hair in huge spongy curlers  i looked like an alien from a ufo  once again i succumbed to a session under the dryer  my penance was  minutes while my hair dried under a moderate heat when i was finally finished i had spent close to   hours in the salon  i was so stir crazy that i was loony tunes   did my hair look great  sort of  it looked soft and very shiny  was it worth almost  hours of treatment  absolutely not was it worth the price i paid for the treatment   probably not dont get me wrong  my long hair specialist spent a lot of time on my hair  i spent even more time on my rear end under a dryer   did my stylist deserve the fee  yes he did  was it worth it for my hair  not really in my opinion i thought that the aveda conditioners cherry almond bark curessence did a great job on my hair and i accomplished similar results in just minutes not hours using the  minute conditioner at home since i tend to be outspoken i told my long hair specialist as politely as i could that i really didnt think the results were equal to the time and money that i had spent  not that i was complaining  i just didnt think it was a good value he understood my position and suggested that it would be best if i bought the gm  minute conditioner and tried a modified version of the treatment at home when i applied the at home treatment i got almost identical results as my long hair stylist did at the salon  i again invested a lot of time under my home bonnet dryer   by doing the treatment at home i saved time money and hassles  i still did not think in my opinion that the condition of my hair after the treatment was worth all the time that i spent yes it did look soft shiny and silky  however i was able to achieve the same soft shiny and silky look with other conditioners that took a lot less time and trouble and did not require the bonnet hairdryer the  version of the  minute conditioner  i decided to recreate my original insalon conditioning experience as closely as possible when i recently cracked open a  version of the gm  minute conditioner i followed all the same steps  i washed my hair with the gm cream shampoo and then towel blotted my hair  i carefully picked all the knots out and applied the gm  minute conditioner with my fingers to  inch individual sections of my hair after wrapping my hair in plastic i plopped down under a hood dryer for  minutes  i took my notebook computer and got quite a bit of work done  luckily the dryer drowned out the sound of my cell phone and any interruptions i have to admit that i enjoyed  hour of peace and not so much quiet to concentrate on business while my hair cooked   i decided that hanging out under hairdryers where i could have some quality work time was a nice new business discovery unfortunately i also decided that the  minute conditioner and my hair were never going to be soul mates yes my hair was soft and silky  however it was not any softer or more silky than when i used edwin pauls deep conditioner avedas curessence or any of the phytologie deep conditioning products  actually the gm comes in lower on the softness scale compared to all the other products when i used aveda or phytologie or edwin paul i dont have to sit under a dryer using the dryer will intensify the results for any extended period of time   yes i enjoyed the peace and quiet but i really cant give up that much time on a regular basis to condition my hair under a hairdryer  ingredients   minute conditioner the  minute conditioner always reminds me of clariols conditioner product  the jars are similar is size and shape and the conditioners are both a white waxy texture i carefully compared the old bottles from under the sink with the  and  versions  they were identical  same packaging same ingredients  i have never figured out how to describe the aroma of the  minute conditioner  it actually smells waxy to me  almost like turtle wax for my car  that is the closest i can come to describing this product the ingredients included  water glyceryl stearate glycerine quaternium  quaternium  myristal myristate c alcohols lactate quaternium  cetyl alcohol diethyl amino ethyl stearate phosphoric acid hydroxy ethyl cellulose propylene glycol diazolidinyl urea methylparaben propylparaben contains no artificial color or perfume

what’s around me” by matt peng mar    fashion      hypes  ·    comments thames recently dropped its  springsummer lookbook which founder blondey mccoy used as not only a homage to fellow brit george michael but also as a continuation of his relationship with the city of london mccoy recreated the katharine hamnett tshirt that michael wore in the music video for “wake me up before you gogo” to read “choose thames” with all profits being donated to kayany charity which helps syrians who face conflict channeling this energy the skater turned artistdesigner sits down with dazed digital to talk about how the brand is a product of his environment and the importance of charity check out some select excerpts below and read the full interview here the first release will drop march  on the thames website and at the london palace store on what was on his mind during this design process i can’t help but be inspired by what’s around me one of my favorite graphics in the line was inspired by the raymond revue bar sign on the corner of walkers court and brewer street whenever i go on long trips i come back and see that and feel okay again that’s my “green green grass of home” the elvis version not tom jones i don’t need to be away from home to appreciate it i’ve referenced thames television an old franchise holder for a region of itv its end credits seem to haunt anyone that can remember it… also pages of ‘smut’ from ’s men only mags that paul raymond published they’re from a time when british porn shoots had to be big doolally productions to disguise their obvious purpose in more prudish times but yes as i’ve said before it’s almost all an homage to the square mile i spend my day wandering around in on “choose thames” and kayany george michael and wham was and still is a constant source of inspiration for me the tshirt was originally set to be released with the autumn line but after he passed at christmas it seemed obvious to bring it forward so the tees were screen printed last minute while i was in los angeles the “wake me up before you gogo’” video which he wears the katharine hamnett “choose life” tee in is so brilliant it’s after he gained a lot of confidence as a performer but before he realized that fame and fortune weren’t the key to happiness and became a bit of a recluse and not really featuring in his solo videos like “freedom ‘’” and “too funky” the way he is in “wake me up before you gogo” is so genuine – he had totally realized his talent as a singer by that point he always looked back on it and said that the director never asked him to roll his eyes or suggested any of his mannerisms or aesthetic so he found it baffling that despite him not holding back on being himself people didn’t realist he was gay even then i get down when i think about how he is the most recent of my heroes to have died at such an early age and after all the charities and individuals whom he anonymously donated to came forward i woke up the other morning thinking it’s only right to donate the profits of this homage to a current and urgent cause i don’t want to be making my living off his death thames is my passion project not my money machine i keep my money machine elsewhere on what’s important to him right now i did two charity sales and an art show last year for the charity together for mental wellbeing which raised about k allinall unfortunately there’s just so much to do and i’ve already wasted so much time… i really think you have to be shaking the tree from the word go i see it as the duty of any influential person be they an artist or musician or designer – whatever you’re there to change people’s outlook on life and in this case i want to draw attention towards the very urgent matter of syria these children are eternally literally shaking from seeing their hometowns and families getting bombed it’s an absolute tragedy and it forces me to put my tentimesayear breakdowns into perspective kayany have built schools in refugee camps offering over three and a half thousand of these kids not just meals but psychosocial support which they need now not just whenever someone can get round to it but there are so many of them there’s too much to say here but please look at their site before you look at the thames website photographerlex kembery read full article share this article    hypes thamesblondey mccoy

jennifer the guy who trims dusts my hair is affiliated with the george michael gm salon its really not rocket science he stresses you have to sacrifice style for length ie no bangs layers etc he

clueless about styling my hair at the time i was very satisfied with my stylist except for the fact she used to overlap my perms and trim too much off my ends needless to say i did not allow her to continue and i started going to him for trims whenever my hair gets ragedy looking i guess i could say on average i go about  times a year after supergirls post about ends my feelings changed about getting them trimmed so often i cant say if he thought that i could acheive the same lengths as his white clients bc the last time i went he asked me if this was all my hair i was thinking no i am

believe many of the ideas could actually be harmful to your hair there are whole chapters on bleaching and permanents there is some very basic common sense advice in the book eat right keep the sun off of your hairbut they are lost in a sea of pseudoscience and anecdotes the author dressesup his opinions with scientific sounding jargon but does not present real evidence to justify his claims he continually refers to his training as a medical doctor in russia but he is not a doctor not that doctors really know anything about long haircare anyway he tells a lot of longwinded stories to support his claims try this laboratory test yourselftake a poodle dog and shave one leghe will begin to drop the hair on the other leg p  as a dog groomer with  years experience i consider this a rediculous assertion he also does a lot of selfaggrandizing namedropping and the majority of the long hair photos in the book are credited to clarol incorporated not george michael the sections on styling dont really help you to control your hair although they may give you some ideas if you already know how to style your hair in sum although it was easy to read this book was really a waste of time   sareca

interview with dr george michael by jennifer bahney httpwwwlonghairloverscomgminterviewhtml while talking with long hair guru dr george michael by phone from his home in florida i found that it was important to understand the man first before trying to understand his passion for long hair george michael selisky was born to russian nobility long before lenin stalin and communism took over his beloved land his mother was an opera singer with incredible floorlength hair as a child he would watch his mother and his aunts brush out their magnificent manes and create intricate updos before entertaining in their extravagant halls but the russian revolution soon caught up with them and georges entire family was killed by the ruthless stalin somehow young george was the only one to escape george attended medical school and was drafted into the russian army he moved up to lieutenant commander and then became a major at the age of  but george was captured by the nazis during world war ii and spent two years as a prisoner of war in a nazi concentration camp the years  to  were some of the most difficult of young georges life he watched beautiful european women with waistlength and longer hair forced into warehouses only to emerge with completely shaven heads according to dr michael it was the nazis way of breaking their prisoners and taking away their identities but dr michael told me the women still held their heads high unwilling to succumb to the nazis attempts at humiliation american troops eventually freed george and he decided to move to the united states with just the clothes on his back it was at this point that george michael selisky decided to drop his last name he also decided to use his medical training to help women around the world grow the beautiful hair he had seen destroyed during the war dr michael enrolled in beauty school and was told that as a doctor he was much too overqualified to work on womens hair he persisted however graduated and rented two chairs at a new york city salon he developed his own system based on medical science for growing and maintaining beautiful long hair in time he had made enough money to buy his own salon dr michaels empire has grown ever since and today at the age of  he owns some  salons around the world dedicated to long hair one of the major questions i asked dr michael during our phone conversation was is it possible to have long healthy hair in your s s s and beyond his answer was a qualified yes but he explained that there are conditions attached first of all dr michael explained that the most important step for growing the longest healthiest hair possible is to have hair thats all one length that means absolutely no bangs or fringe to our european friends dr michael told me bangs are like worms which i took to mean theyre a pretty bad thing fortunately he explained what he meant hair is not at its strongest with bangs or layers dr michael said because humans are mammals nature will try to equalize the hair by excessively shedding in order to even out all the shorter hairs this creates an abnormal loss of hair which leads to unhealthy straggly locks dr michael also explained that people especially women with bluntcut long hair have the strongest healthiest hair possible the longer the hair the stronger the root dr michael said thats because the root has to work more to support the length and stronger hair is healthier hair that falls out less to prove this point dr michael says hair thats cut in a inch style may lose up to  hairs a day hair thats inches long loses up to  hairs a day waistlength hair loses  hairs a day and floorlength hair loses just two hairs a day as far as growing hair faster dr michael says hair typically grows just  inches per year i know of just three places in the world where women grow more than halfaninch per month tehuantepec mexico the piedmont province of northern italy and in parts of minnesota those areas lack iodine in the water which causes severe thyroid dysfunctions including bulging eyes and horrible weight gain but their hair is known to grow up to  inches per month they also shed their hair  times during their lifetime as opposed to healthy people who shed most during six periods in our lifetimes from birth to age three at     and  these shedding times are all related to hormonal changes in our bodies and are the bodys way of ensuring a sixinch growth rate per year no more no less so how does one go about growing out those pesky bangs the hair grows from left to right on your forehead part your hair on the left as your bangs grow out once theyre long enough part your hair on the right so your hair does pushups and doesnt appear flat once your bangs reach chinlength youll notice a serious reduction in fallout as for my question about long hair and age dr michael told me age is irrelevant with long hair a womans beauty is timeless   last edited apr   tkj apr    tkj member blog posts  joined feb

conversations with dr george michael the premiere long hair guru in the world i had the honor of being invited to his home in west palm beach florida to discuss all things having to do with long hair the walls in dr michaels office are filled with photographs of some of the most incredible longhaired beauties in the world  all of them his clients they included singer crystal gayle playboy playmate debra jo fondren guinness book of world records holder dianne witt and countless models actresses and european nobles modelofthe moment giselle bundchen was also featured  she regularly visits the george michael salon in beverly hills i was extremely fortunate to have dr michael give me my own onehour consultation during which he explained the principles of his system it was all very scientific yet dr michael explained it in language that anyone could understand some of his most interesting points were we inherit our hair from our fathers mother and our mothers father hair becomes adult when we reach age  women go through three major stages of hair loss that coincide with stages of menopause at ages   and  most women can grow their hair to tailbone length with proper care dr michael then sent me off to prepare my hair for a minute conditioning i first applied a little of his conditioner to the outside of my hair to balance the phfactor dr michael explained that ph is the measure used to determine the amount of acid and alkiline in hair waters ph is  he also explained that i should always use a spoon or spatula to scoop the creamy conditioner out of the container to prevent bacteria from tainting the unused product once i had about a teaspoon of conditioner smoothed on the outside layer of my hair dr michael instructed me to wash and rinse twice with his cream shampoo he then showed me how to apply the minute conditioner to my damp hair from the length at my shoulders down to the tips true to its name the conditioner sat on my hair for  minutes dr michael did not apply heat explaining that it wasnt necessary for the minute conditioning although he wouldnt tell me the ingredients in the conditioner he did say that it contained special proteins that filled in any gaps in the hair shaft making it smooth and silky after the  minutes were up i rinsed my hair thoroughly and was ready to be combed out dr michael used a widetooth comb that literally slid through my hair i found this amazing since i usually have to apply detangler right after washing but the minute conditioner had done its job so well that none was needed dr michael then roller set my hair and applied a hair net to secure it i sat under a professional dryer that dr michael explained got no hotter than  degrees the perfect temperature for drying long hair it took about an hour and a half to fully dry my midback length hair this way after removing the rollers dr michael had me flip my head upside down to brush  strokes from the nape of my neck to the tips i was to follow each stroke with my other hand to prevent static from building dr michael explained that i should brush my hair this way each morning right when i got up to get the circulation properly moving to my scalp which promotes hair growth next dr michael assessed my cut he considered it too blunt or straight across the bottom and explained how tapering the cut like a halfcircle was best for hair growth he left the middle part of my hair its full  inches and tapered the sides to achieve the roundness when he was finished my hair felt incredibly silky and swung beautifully when i shook my head some of dr michaels tips for my hair growth which can be applied to most anyone include  dont wash hair every day think of hair like a piece of fine silk that begins to fade after repeated washing in addition overwashing hair can actually make it greasier  properly brushing hair every morning will distribute the scalps sebum to the thirsty ends  dont color long hair  its very damaging and should be avoided if possible surprisingly highlights are much better for long hair since only the roots are touched up each time  use only a boar bristle brush with a wooden base dr michael explained that natural materials are least likely to cause hair damage   tkj apr    candyc new member blog posts  joined dec   messages  likes received  trophy points  location uk west midlands his ideas sound great especially the layers

for caring for long hair he is considered the guru of long hair care and his clients have included famous longhaired beauties such as crystal gayle hair washing tips one doesnt lose hair through washing but rather through friction and tangling with shorter hair how one massages the scalp is not so important you can move your fingers back and forth zigzag in circles figure eights or sideways  it doesnt matter because it hardly tangles in contrast long hair gets tangled when the scalp is massaged in circles or zigzag lines by trying to untangle it tears or falls out completely  the best place to wash your hair is in the shower although some women prefer the wash basin or more especially bending over the bathtub  stand bent over with your head tucked downwards this relaxes the scalp and promotes blood circulation if your head is higher than your elbows the muscles in your scalp may cramp up try it yourself to see the difference  all the dirt and oil particles should be expelled during the first shampoo which serves as the purification of the hair during the second shampoo the scalp should be massaged and not the hair  for the correct massage begin at the hairline and work towards the top massaging the scalp keep your hands beneath your hair and move them back and forth donâ€™t use your hair as a scrub brush when youâ€™re finished massaging the scalp shampoo the rest of your hair to the ends treat it like silk and try to avoid knots  finally rinse out your hair thoroughly with warm water if any of the bubbles remain the hair will be dull and sticky feel the hair after cleansing and make sure the slightest trace of shampoo canâ€™t be found  if you can stand it rinse hair in cold water this allows the hair molecules to shrink and carries away all unnecessary layers the hair will be easier to comb  pour a dab of rinse into your palm and apply with strokes to the length of your hair then rinse once more but with lukewarm water  when you step out of the shower use a hand towel to get rid of excess water  try to comb through the hair with your fingers as long as it remains wet never brush when wet hair has a certain elasticity and can stretch fron  to  of its original length luckily the hair normalizes itself when dry when wet it behaves like an over stretched rubber band and breaks use instead a widetoothed tortoise shell comb to untangled and smooth out your hair  part the hair in small sections and begin cm above the ends to comb it out when the entire lower section is untangled go approximately cm up from the bottom and comb the hair in narrow strands through to the underside continue until you reach the scalp and all is tanglefree there are four different washing methods for you to use at different times and for different types of hair washing method  a method for medium to bra length hair washing the entire length of hair no more than twice a week order a shampoo b cream rinse a wet hair with warm water apply shampoo and swoosh around the hair on the first lather rinse with warm water apply shampoo a second time and massage scalp avoid rigorous scrubbing gently wash the hair from the scalp down using regrasping motions to avoid tangling rinse well until no suds appear in the water b apply madora george michael cream rinse to the outer layers and ends only rinse well  you may want to finish with a final cold rinse to add additional shine to your hair washing method  a method for very long hair washing the entire length of hair no more than once a week order a prewash conditioner while your hair is still dry take  tablespoon of  minute conditioner apply conditioner to the ends and the top layer of your hair be sure only these trouble areas are wellcoated at this time do not apply prewash conditioner to your scalp or the remaining area of hair wash hair immediately b shampoo after applying our prewash conditioner wet your hair and apply a tablespoon of shampoo until a rich lather develops remember to wash the ends of your hair as well as your scalp rinse and always shampoo again the first wash removes superficial dirt and oils the second deep cleans c cream rinse use madora george michael creme rinse after you condition and shampoo pour one teaspoon into your hand and apply only to the ends of your hair and halfway up the hairs shaft then rinse rinse and rinse see those tiny bubbles at the drain rinse until they are reduced to just a few finish with a cold water rinse cold water eliminates residue closes scalp pores and reduces the stretch in the hair created by hot water   last edited

conditioner will work well at room temperature c cream rinse pour one teaspoon into your hand apply only to the ends of your hair and half way up the hairâ€™s shaft not on the scalp rinse well washing method  wash scalp only every day or every other day in between regular shampoos which should be once a week many of us wash our hair daily however shampooing once a week is best for the delicate ends of the hair the solution is to wash the scalp daily or every two days in between the three methods listed below will keep your hair clean and fresh smelling while protecting the ends a have a friend hold up the ends of your hair while bending over the sink wash and rinse your scalp only then gently pat the wet portion of your hair dry with a towel b with one hand hold the ends of your hair away from the water wash and rinse your scalp with your other hand then gently towel dry your hair c loosely pull your hair back into a braid at the nape of your neck and secure well bend over the sink and wash and rinse your scalp only towel off and you have clean hair always be sure to rinse well any residue will collect oil and dirt faster when washing the scalp only the madora george michael pre  wash conditioner and the madora george michael cream rinse are not necessary if and when your shampoo stops working and they all eventually do build up will occur use the blue shampoo which acts as a stripper of build up and yet remains gentle to the hair use it when you start to notice that the cream shampoo is less effective two washings with the blue shampoo should be sufficient and then go back to the cream shampoo be sure to use the pre  wash conditioner on the ends and outer layer of hair when using the blue shampoo sometimes when you feel you still have residues left use three sudsings drying your hair airdrying is always best if you would rather dry your hair artificially first set your hair with plastic rollers then sit under a hood dryer to prevent damage to your hair keep the dryer at a constant temperature about  degrees centigrade or  degrees fahrenheit another gentle way to artificially dry your hair is to attach a diffuser to your blow dryer this device spreads the hot air evenly making the heat far less intense if you would like to air dry your hair without getting the frizzles wait until your hair is  dry and then roll it on curlers apply a hairnet and dry your hair completely under a hair dryer  the warmth of the dryer will smooth out the hair depending on the richness of your hair it will take    minutes youll be surprised at the results never use heated rollers or curling tongs these devices dry and break long hair if you must blow dry use a diffuser dry roots first then dry lengths with gentle temperature once your hair is dry you may brush it to a glorious shine brushing for a healthy head of beautiful hair you must treat nourish strengthen and stimulate the living part of the hair  the root brushing is an essential part of hair treatment it keeps the scalp supple and accelerates the blood circulation which feeds the roots and distributes needed fatty acids along the length of the hair assuring smoother combing without breaking since lubricants also serve as moisturizers we advise our clients to brush their hair as soon as they get up in the morning and only to use a natural bristle with a wooden base why brush in the morning brushing stimulates the circulation to the scalp and fluffs the hair dont think for a minute that this will make your hair more oily brushing actually distributes the oils to the ends of your hair which in turn is a natural protection for the hair against weather conditions and other stressful occurrences never brush wet hair hair is more elastic when wet than when dry and it will stretch when wet to the point of snapping if you use a brush instead use a wide tooth tortoise  shell comb start with the ends and slowly work your way up to the scalp never use a metal or rubber comb use a natural bristle brush with a wooden base the natural bristles are closest to the hair structure itself and therefore are less likely to produce tangles on long hair the wooden base reduces static electricity method stand with feet slightly apart and bend down from the waist until the hair falls in a curtain before your face brush your hair gently starting from the roots at the nape of your neck and moving toward the end of the hair follow each brush stroke with the open palm of your other hand this counteracts a build  up of static electricity start the first day with  brush strokes then add  strokes each day for oily condition or fine hair start with  strokes then add  strokes each day your goal fifty brush strokes a day remember that morning brushing produces the best results   last edited apr   tkj apr    tkj member blog posts  joined feb   messages  likes received  trophy points  location jean grey school for higher learning parting the hair you probably part your hair on the left side or use a center part we suggest that you part your hair on the right side hair follicles along the forehead grow from the left to the right a right side part adds height and has your hair doing pushups the middle part is definitely out it puts additional stress on the weakest hairs on the top of the head which results in hair thinning and the part spreading wider a center part forms a line that goes down the middle of the face which accentuates the nose and any irregularities that exist between the left and the right side of the face there are only a very very few
