management  enterprise mobile app there are many mobile app and custom software developers in the market they essentially develop highly customized enterprise applications at a price range between  to  the high pricing resulted in many small  medium enterprises smes not being able to afford their solutions as each mobile app project is highly customized the developer has to build the mobile app from scratch resulting in long development time furthermore there are no significant recurring revenues from such custom mobile app projects this makes their business model difficult to scale as each project is unique some of these notable players in singapore and malaysia include rainmaker labs and codigo  mobile pointofsale for restaurants we face competition from both mature traditional pointofsale pos providers and new mobile pos players a traditional pos they have established market share mature hardware and software they are the de facto choice when new fb outlets open for business however these traditional pos systems run on expensive proprietary hardware and are at best a cash register such traditional pos systems are difficult to integrate with other business software such as crm loyalty program accounting and inventory management software traditional pos deployments account for almost  of all pos deployment in singapore and malaysia some established players in this segment include epoint pos and raptor pos b ipad emenu ordering systems these solutions enable customers to selforder via an ipad thus reducing the need for a waiter to take orders the cost of deployment can be high as there is a need to deploy one ipad per table during operations spillage from soups and drinks can damage these devices resulting in high ongoing replacement and maintenance costs these solutions are not connected to the cloud and hence cannot process online takeaway orders running on proprietary software also makes it difficult to integrate such solutions with other business software one of the notable players in this segment is a startup called tabsquare c ipad pos ipad pos players is rapidly capturing market share from traditional pos players low cost of adoption coupled with readily available consumer grade hardware ipad and routers are the key drivers to this migration however these solutions while innovative are difficult to integrate with other business software most does not offer processing of orders from customer’s mobile phones and are not integrated with kitchen display system the leading player globally for ipad pos for restaurants is revel pos company description we are a development stage company with no earnings to date and operations and assets consistent with our age with a focus on earlystage business
