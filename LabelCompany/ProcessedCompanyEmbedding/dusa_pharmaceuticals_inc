strengthssolution containing  aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride ala hcl by weight in a plastic applicator device  contraindicationsthe levulan kerastick for topical solution plus blue light illumination using the bluu blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator is contraindicated in patients with cutaneous photosensitivity at wavelengths of  nm porphyria or known allergies to porphyrins and in patients with known sensitivity to any of the components of the levulan kerastick for topical solution  warnings and precautions  photosensitivity during the time period between the application of levulan kerastick topical solution and exposure to activating light from the bluu blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator the treatment site will become photosensitive after levulan kerastick topical solution application patients should avoid exposure of the photosensitive treatment sites to sunlight or bright indoor light eg examination lamps operating room lamps tanning beds or lights at close proximity during the period prior to blue light treatment exposure may result in a stinging andor burning sensation and may cause erythema andor edema of the lesions before exposure to sunlight patients should therefore protect treated lesions from the sun by wearing a widebrimmed hat or similar head covering of lightopaque material sunscreens will not protect against photosensitivity reactions caused by visible light it has not been determined if perspiration can spread the levulan kerastick topical solution outside the treatment site to eye or surrounding skin application of levulan kerastick topical solution to perilesional areas of photodamaged skin of the face or scalp may result in photosensitization upon exposure to activating light from the bluu blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator such photosensitized skin may produce a stinging andor burning sensation and may become erythematous andor edematous in a manner similar to that of actinic keratoses treated with levulan kerastick photodynamic therapy because of the potential for skin to become photosensitized the levulan kerastick should be used by a qualified health professional to apply drug only to actinic keratoses and not perilesional skin if for any reason the patient cannot return for blue light treatment during the prescribed period after application of levulan kerastick topical solution  to  hours the patient should call the doctor the patient should also continue to avoid exposure of the photosensitized lesions to sunlight or prolonged or intense light for at least  hours
