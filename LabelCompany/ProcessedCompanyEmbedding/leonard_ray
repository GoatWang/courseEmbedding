leonard working for a percentage of the closedcircuit gate as well as a guarantee received over  million angelo dundee counseled leonard to box to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes however leonard decided to fight duráns way flatfooted he said i will not run durán forced the issue and took the fight to leonard cutting off the ring and denying leonard space to fight his fight durán attacked at almost every turn leonard battled back again and again but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing at times simply to survive in the second durán rocked leonard with a left hook sending him into the ropes leonard started to do better by the fifth round finding some punching room and throwing numerous multipunch combinations the two fought with great intensity throughout the fight according to bill nack it was from almost the opening salvo a fight that belonged to durán the panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had he took control attacking and driving leonard against the ropes bulling him back hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner always

front of  fans leonard received  million and durán received  million dave jacobs disagreed with the decision to have an immediate rematch with durán and terminated his relationship with leonard when the rematch was made my idea is that he should have a tuneup fight before he fights with roberto again jacobs said i think he won the fight with durán but i dont think it is healthy for him to be fighting durán right away after the montreal fight durán went on a partying binge and ballooned in weight leonard was aware of this and in an interview for beyond the glory he said my intention was to fight durán asap because i knew duráns habits i knew he would indulge himself hed gain – lbs and then sweat it off to make  unlike the fight in montreal leonard used his superior speed and movement to

veteran trainers freddie brown and ray arcel i was shocked brown said there was no indication that he was in pain or getting weak arcel was angry thats it he said ive had it this is terrible ive handled thousands of fighters and never had anyone quit on me i think he needs a psychiatrist more than he needs anything else duráns manager carlos eleta said durán didnt quit because of stomach cramps he quit because he was embarrassed i know this according to randy gordon who witnessed duráns antics beforehand and was in his dressing room immediately afterwards durán quit because of his huge eating binge prior to the fight i made him quit leonard said to make a man quit to make roberto durán quit was better than knocking him out second world titleedit leonard vs bondsedit on march

he just didnt want to box anymore missing the limelight and the competition leonard announced in december  that he was returning to the ring leonard boasted that he would have a couple of tenround

risks with his surgically repaired eye a bout with philadelphias kevin howard who was –– was scheduled for february   the fight was postponed when leonard had minor surgery on his right eye to fix a

mike trainer and said i can beat hagler on may   leonard announced on a washington dc talk show that he would return to the ring to fight hagler the announcement generated a lot of controversy because of leonards inactivity and eye injuries yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier hagler took a few months to decide then agreed to the match the fight promoted as the super fight and the king of the ring was scheduled for april   at caesars palace in las vegas leonard was guaranteed  million and hagler was guaranteed  million hagler was a heavy favorite the odds started at – then settled at – a paying crowd  generated a live gate of  million according to bob arum the fight grossed  million which would equates to m in  the original fight plan for leonard was to go toetotoe with hagler and try to cut him but the plan changed about five days before the fight leonard got hit by sparring partner quincy taylor and was badly buckled he almost knocked me out leonard said after that leonard decided to box hagler many were surprised that hagler a natural southpaw opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance after the quick and slick leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards hagler started the third round as a southpaw hagler did better but leonards superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the nbc network rebroadcast gil clancy to remark and is he ever missingleonard isnt doing anything to make him miss hes just missing by the fifth leonard who was moving a lot began to tire and hagler started to get closer hagler buckled leonards knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round which finished with leonard on the ropes hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six leonard having slowed down was obliged to fight more and move less however he was able to outpunch hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against thomas hearns two years earlier when he brutalized hearns and scored a thirdround knockout haglers punches lacked snap and although he was scoring solidly to the body he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years leonards observation that the hagler who beat john mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on in rounds seven and eight haglers southpaw jab was landing solidly and leonards counter flurries were less frequent round nine was the most exciting round of the fight hagler hurt leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner leonard looked to be in trouble but he furiously fought his way out of the corner the action seesawed back and forth for the rest of the round with each man having his moments however haglers moments were more spectacular and one of haglers cornermen roger perron in an interview that took place on an episode of hbos legendary nights episode segments in  later stated that the ninth round was probably marvin haglers best round round ten was tame by comparison as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with hagler having more spectacular moments despite leonards obvious fatigue he boxed well in the eleventh every time hagler scored leonard came back with something flashier and more eyecatching if not as effective but at that point in the fight hagler appeared to be slightly more ringgeneral and clearly more aggressive between rounds eleven and twelve leonards trainer angelo dundee implored sugar ray to get up off his stool yelling we got three minutesnew champnew champ leonard yelled yeah and played to the screaming crowd haglers corner was much more reserved prompting clancy to comment theyre talking to him like its an ibm meeting or somethingno emotion in the final round hagler continued to chase leonard he hit leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner leonard responded with a furious flurry landing few punches but whipping the upsethoping crowd into a frenzy hagler backed off and leonard danced away with hagler in pursuit the fight ended with hagler and leonard exchanging along the ropes at the final bell even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding leonards effort leonard threw  punches and landed  while hagler threw  and landed  leonard was awarded a controversial splitdecision judge dave moretti scored it – for leonard while judge lou filippo had it – for hagler judge josé guerra scored the fight – for leonard many felt that hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches scottish boxing journalist hugh mcilvanney wrote that leonards plan was to steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurrieshe was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champions gloves and arms many others felt that leonard deservedly got the decision arguing that leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship jim murray longtime sports columnist for the los angeles times wrote it wasnt even closehe didnt just outpoint hagler he exposed him he made him look like a guy chasing a bus in snowshoes leonard repeatedly beat hagler to the punch when he did he hit harder he hit more often he made hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler a swarmer a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him if you moved he was lost the fight was named fight of the year and upset of the year by the ring despite requests from the hagler camp leonard was uninterested in a rematch and retired on may   ill try ill give it a shot leonard said of his

would be leonards first professional fight without angelo dundee for leonards fight with hagler dundee worked without a contract and received  which was less than  of leonards purse dundee was unhappy with that amount he requested a contract for the lalonde fight and leonard refused i dont have contracts my word is my bond leonard said janks morton and dave jacobs trained leonard for the lalonde fight lalondes size and awkwardness troubled leonard in the fourth round a right hand to the top of leonards head dropped him for just the second time in his career early in the ninth lalonde hurt leonard with a right to the chin leonard fired back and hurt lalonde with a right he drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault lalonde tried to tie up leonard but got dropped with a powerful left hook he rose but was soon down again and the fight was stopped judges chuck giampa and franz marti had leonard ahead by scores of – and – respectively judge stuart kirshenbaum had lalonde ahead – after the fight leonard vacated the light heavyweight title but kept the super middleweight title also leonard and janks morton split because of personal differences morton was

got hit by sparring partner quincy taylor and was badly buckled he almost knocked me out leonard said after that leonard decided to box hagler many were surprised that hagler a natural southpaw opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance after the quick and slick leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards hagler started the third round as a southpaw hagler did better but leonards superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the nbc network rebroadcast gil clancy to remark and is he ever missingleonard isnt doing anything to make him miss hes just missing by the fifth leonard who was moving a lot began to tire and hagler started to get closer hagler buckled leonards knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round which finished with leonard on the ropes hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six leonard having slowed down was obliged to fight more and move less however he was able to outpunch hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against thomas hearns two years earlier when he brutalized hearns and scored a thirdround knockout haglers punches lacked snap and although he was scoring solidly to the body he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years leonards observation that the hagler who beat john mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on in rounds seven and eight haglers southpaw jab was landing solidly and leonards counter flurries were less frequent round nine was the most exciting round of the fight hagler hurt leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner leonard looked to be in trouble but he furiously fought his way out of the corner the action seesawed back and forth for the rest of the round with each man having his moments however haglers moments were more spectacular and one of haglers cornermen roger perron in an interview that took place on an episode of hbos legendary nights episode segments in  later stated that the ninth round was probably marvin haglers best round round ten was tame by comparison as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with hagler having more spectacular moments despite leonards obvious fatigue he boxed well in the eleventh every time hagler scored leonard came back with something flashier and more eyecatching if not as effective but at that point in the fight hagler appeared to be slightly more ringgeneral and clearly more aggressive between rounds eleven and twelve leonards trainer angelo dundee implored sugar ray to get up off his stool yelling we got three minutesnew champnew champ leonard yelled yeah and played to the screaming crowd haglers corner was much more reserved prompting clancy to comment theyre talking to him like its an ibm meeting or somethingno emotion in the final round hagler continued to chase leonard he hit leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner leonard responded with a furious flurry landing few punches but whipping the upsethoping crowd into a frenzy hagler backed off and leonard danced away with hagler in pursuit the fight ended with hagler and leonard exchanging along the ropes at the final bell even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding leonards effort leonard threw  punches and landed  while hagler threw  and landed  leonard was awarded a controversial splitdecision judge dave moretti scored it – for leonard while judge lou filippo had it – for hagler judge josé guerra scored the fight – for leonard many felt that hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches scottish boxing journalist hugh mcilvanney wrote that leonards plan was to steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurrieshe was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champions gloves and arms many others felt that leonard deservedly got the decision arguing that leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship jim murray longtime sports columnist for the los angeles times wrote it wasnt even closehe didnt just outpoint hagler he exposed him he made him look like a guy chasing a bus in snowshoes leonard repeatedly beat hagler to the punch when he did he hit harder he hit more often he made hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler a swarmer a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him if you moved he was lost the fight was named fight of the year and upset of the year by the ring despite requests from the hagler camp leonard was uninterested in a rematch and

mugabi it was then that leonard decided to come back and fight hagler he called mike trainer and said i can beat hagler on may   leonard announced on a washington dc talk show that he would return to the ring to fight hagler the announcement generated a lot of controversy because of leonards inactivity and eye injuries yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier hagler took a few months to decide then agreed to the match the fight promoted as the super fight and the king of the ring was scheduled for april   at caesars palace in las vegas leonard was guaranteed  million and hagler was guaranteed  million hagler was a heavy favorite the odds started at – then settled at – a paying crowd  generated a live gate of  million according to bob arum the fight grossed  million which would equates to m in  the original fight plan for leonard was to go toetotoe with hagler and try to cut him but the plan changed about five days before the fight leonard got hit by sparring partner quincy taylor and was badly buckled he almost knocked me out leonard said after that leonard decided to box hagler many were surprised that hagler a natural southpaw opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance after the quick and slick leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards hagler started the third round as a southpaw hagler did better but leonards superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the nbc network rebroadcast gil clancy to remark and is he ever missingleonard isnt doing anything to make him miss hes just missing by the fifth leonard who was moving a lot began to tire and hagler started to get closer hagler buckled leonards knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round which finished with leonard on the ropes hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six leonard having slowed down was obliged to fight more and move less however he was able to outpunch hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against thomas hearns two years earlier when he brutalized hearns and scored a thirdround knockout haglers punches lacked snap and although he was scoring solidly to the body he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years leonards observation that the hagler who beat john mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on in rounds seven and eight haglers southpaw jab was landing solidly and leonards counter flurries were less frequent round nine was the most exciting round of the fight hagler hurt leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner leonard looked to be in trouble but he furiously fought his way out of the corner the action seesawed back and forth for the rest of the round with each man having his moments however haglers moments were more spectacular and one of haglers cornermen roger perron in an interview that took place on an episode of hbos legendary nights episode segments in  later stated that the ninth round was probably marvin haglers best round round ten was tame by comparison as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with hagler having more spectacular moments despite leonards obvious fatigue he boxed well in the eleventh every time hagler scored leonard came back with something flashier and more eyecatching if not as effective but at that point in the fight hagler appeared to be slightly more ringgeneral and clearly more aggressive between rounds eleven and twelve leonards trainer angelo dundee implored sugar ray to get up off his stool yelling we got three minutesnew champnew champ leonard yelled yeah and played to the screaming crowd haglers corner was much more reserved prompting clancy to comment theyre talking to him like its an ibm meeting or somethingno emotion in the final round hagler continued to chase leonard he hit leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner leonard responded with a furious flurry landing few punches but whipping the upsethoping crowd into a frenzy hagler backed off and leonard danced away with hagler in pursuit the fight ended with hagler and leonard exchanging along the ropes at the final bell even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding leonards effort leonard threw  punches and landed  while hagler threw  and landed  leonard was awarded a controversial splitdecision judge dave moretti scored it – for leonard while judge lou filippo had it – for hagler judge josé guerra scored the fight – for leonard many felt that hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches scottish boxing journalist hugh mcilvanney wrote that leonards plan was to steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurrieshe was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champions gloves and arms many others felt that leonard deservedly got the decision arguing that leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship jim murray longtime sports columnist for the los angeles times wrote it wasnt even closehe didnt just outpoint hagler he exposed him he made him look like a guy chasing a bus in snowshoes leonard repeatedly beat hagler to the punch when he did he hit harder he hit more often he made hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler a swarmer a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him if you moved he was lost the fight was named fight of the year and upset of the year by the ring despite requests from the hagler camp leonard was uninterested in a rematch and

judge jerry roth scored the fight – for hearns judge tom kazmarek scored it – for leonard and judge dalby shirley scored it – shirley was the only judge to give leonard a – margin in the twelfth if he

unfortunately never happen leonard maintained his eye was fully healed but that he just didnt want to box anymore missing the limelight and the competition leonard announced in december  that he was returning to the ring leonard boasted that he would have a couple of tenround bouts and then take on milton mccrory donald curry durán hearns and finally hagler this decision was met with a torrent of

mugabi it was then that leonard decided to come back and fight hagler he called mike trainer and said i can beat hagler on may   leonard announced on a washington dc talk show that he would return to the ring to fight hagler the announcement generated a lot of controversy because of leonards inactivity and eye injuries yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier hagler took a few months to decide then agreed to the match the fight promoted as the super fight and the king of the ring was scheduled for april   at caesars palace in las vegas leonard was guaranteed  million and hagler was guaranteed  million hagler was a heavy favorite the odds started at – then settled at – a paying crowd  generated a live gate of  million according to bob arum the fight grossed  million which would equates to m in  the original fight plan for leonard was to go toetotoe with hagler and try to cut him but the plan changed about five days before the fight leonard got hit by sparring partner quincy taylor and was badly buckled he almost knocked me out leonard said after that leonard decided to box hagler many were surprised that hagler a natural southpaw opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance after the quick and slick leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards hagler started the third round as a southpaw hagler did better but leonards superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the nbc network rebroadcast gil clancy to remark and is he ever missingleonard isnt doing anything to make him miss hes just missing by the fifth leonard who was moving a lot began to tire and hagler started to get closer hagler buckled leonards knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round which finished with leonard on the ropes hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six leonard having slowed down was obliged to fight more and move less however he was able to outpunch hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against thomas hearns two years earlier when he brutalized hearns and scored a thirdround knockout haglers punches lacked snap and although he was scoring solidly to the body he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years leonards observation that the hagler who beat john mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on in rounds seven and eight haglers southpaw jab was landing solidly and leonards counter flurries were less frequent round nine was the most exciting round of the fight hagler hurt leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner leonard looked to be in trouble but he furiously fought his way out of the corner the action seesawed back and forth for the rest of the round with each man having his moments however haglers moments were more spectacular and one of haglers cornermen roger perron in an interview that took place on an episode of hbos legendary nights episode segments in  later stated that the ninth round was probably marvin haglers best round round ten was tame by comparison as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with hagler having more spectacular moments despite leonards obvious fatigue he boxed well in the eleventh every time hagler scored leonard came back with something flashier and more eyecatching if not as effective but at that point in the fight hagler appeared to be slightly more ringgeneral and clearly more aggressive between rounds eleven and twelve leonards trainer angelo dundee implored sugar ray to get up off his stool yelling we got three minutesnew champnew champ leonard yelled yeah and played to the screaming crowd haglers corner was much more reserved prompting clancy to comment theyre talking to him like its an ibm meeting or somethingno emotion in the final round hagler continued to chase leonard he hit leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner leonard responded with a furious flurry landing few punches but whipping the upsethoping crowd into a frenzy hagler backed off and leonard danced away with hagler in pursuit the fight ended with hagler and leonard exchanging along the ropes at the final bell even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding leonards effort leonard threw  punches and landed  while hagler threw  and landed  leonard was awarded a controversial splitdecision judge dave moretti scored it – for leonard while judge lou filippo had it – for hagler judge josé guerra scored the fight – for leonard many felt that hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches scottish boxing journalist hugh mcilvanney wrote that leonards plan was to steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurrieshe was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champions gloves and arms many others felt that leonard deservedly got the decision arguing that leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship jim murray longtime sports columnist for the los angeles times wrote it wasnt even closehe didnt just outpoint hagler he exposed him he made him look like a guy chasing a bus in snowshoes leonard repeatedly beat hagler to the punch when he did he hit harder he hit more often he made hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler a swarmer a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him if you moved he was lost the fight was named fight of the year and upset of the year by the ring despite requests from the hagler camp leonard was uninterested in a rematch and

judge jerry roth scored the fight – for hearns judge tom kazmarek scored it – for leonard and judge dalby shirley scored it – shirley was the only judge to give leonard a – margin in the twelfth if he

got up quickly benitez started to do better in the fourth slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand i wasnt aware i was in a championship early because i hit him so easy leonard said but then he adjusted to my style it was like looking in a mirror in the sixth there was an accidental clash of heads which opened a cut on the forehead of benitez blood flowed down his

contender and considered the best pound for pound fighter in the world durán received  million and leonard working for a percentage of the closedcircuit gate as well as a guarantee received over  million angelo dundee counseled leonard to box to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes however leonard decided to fight duráns way flatfooted he said i will not run durán forced the issue and took the fight to leonard cutting off the ring and denying leonard space to fight his fight durán attacked at almost every turn leonard battled back again and again but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing at times simply to survive in the second durán rocked leonard with a left hook sending him into the ropes leonard started to do better by the fifth round finding some punching room and throwing numerous multipunch combinations the two fought with great intensity throughout the fight according to bill nack it was from almost the opening salvo a fight that belonged to durán the panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had he took control attacking and driving leonard against the ropes bulling him back hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner always moving forward he mauled and wrestled leonard scoring inside with hooks and rights for three rounds durán drove at sugar ray with a fury and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five unable to get away unable to counter and unable to slide away to open up the ring leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault now and then he got loose and countered—leftrightleft to duráns bobbing head—but he missed punches and could not work inside could not jab could not mount an offense to keep durán at bay durán was awarded a unanimous decision although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring the scorecard of judge angelo poletti was incorrectly added and announced as – he actually scored it – in rounds he had it three for durán two for leonard and ten even sports illustrated called his scorecard a monument to indecision judges raymond baldeyrou and harry gibbs scored the fight – and – respectively associated press had it – for durán while the new york times had leonard ahead – i did the best i could leonard said i think i pretty much fought from the heart asked if leonard was the best he ever fought durán thought for a moment and then answered si si durán said he does have a heart thats why hes living revenge in new orleansedit the rematch billed as stone vs sugar once again took place november   at the louisiana superdome in new orleans in front of  fans leonard received  million and durán received  million dave jacobs disagreed with the decision to have an immediate rematch with durán and terminated his relationship with leonard when the rematch was made my idea is that he should have a tuneup fight before he fights with roberto again jacobs said i

to hear him announce whether he would continue his career standing in a boxing ring with howard cosell the master of ceremonies leonard announced his retirement saying a bout with hagler would unfortunately never happen leonard maintained his eye was fully healed but that he just didnt want to box anymore missing the limelight and the competition leonard announced in december  that he was returning to the ring leonard boasted that he would have a couple of tenround bouts and then take on milton mccrory donald curry durán hearns and finally hagler this decision was met with a torrent of criticism from fans and the media who felt leonard was taking unnecessary risks with his surgically repaired eye a bout with philadelphias kevin howard who was –– was scheduled for february   the fight was postponed when leonard had minor surgery on his right eye to fix a loose retina this latest eye problem further fueled the flames of those who opposed leonards comeback before the fight with howard dave jacobs rejoined leonards team in a limited role jacobs had quit in  disagreeing with leonards decision to have an immediate rematch with durán leonard and howard fought on may   in worcester massachusetts howard knocked leonard flat on his back in the fourth round it was the first knockdown of leonards professional career leonard came back to stop howard in the ninth round but the stoppage was disputed with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage at the postfight press conference leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again saying he just didnt have it anymore the super fightedit on march   marvin hagler knocked out john mugabi in eleven rounds to retain the undisputed world middleweight championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to –– i was ringside leonard said im watching john the beast mugabi fight hagler of all people john the beast mugabi it was then that leonard decided to come back and fight hagler he called mike trainer and said i can beat hagler on may   leonard announced on a washington dc talk show that he would return to the ring to fight hagler the announcement generated a lot of controversy because of leonards inactivity and eye injuries yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier hagler took a few months to decide then agreed to the match the fight promoted as the super fight and the king of the ring was scheduled for april   at caesars palace in las vegas leonard was guaranteed  million and hagler was guaranteed  million hagler was a heavy favorite the odds started at – then settled at – a paying crowd  generated a live gate of  million according to bob arum the fight grossed  million which would equates to m in  the original fight plan for leonard was to go toetotoe with hagler and try to cut him but the plan changed about five days before the fight leonard got hit by sparring partner quincy taylor and was badly buckled he almost knocked me out leonard said after that leonard decided to box hagler many were surprised that hagler a natural southpaw opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance after the quick and slick leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards hagler started the third round as a southpaw hagler did better but leonards superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy leonard time and again prompting ringside commentator for the nbc network rebroadcast gil clancy to remark and is he ever missingleonard isnt doing anything to make him miss hes just missing by the fifth leonard who was moving a lot began to tire and hagler started to get closer hagler buckled leonards knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round which finished with leonard on the ropes hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six leonard having slowed down was obliged to fight more and move less however he was able to outpunch hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against thomas hearns two years earlier when he brutalized hearns and scored a thirdround knockout haglers punches lacked snap and although he was scoring solidly to the body he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years leonards observation that the hagler who beat john mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on in rounds seven and eight haglers southpaw jab was landing solidly and leonards counter flurries were less frequent round nine was the most exciting round of the fight hagler hurt leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner leonard looked to be in trouble but he furiously fought his way out of the corner the action seesawed back and forth for the rest of the round with each man having his moments however haglers moments were more spectacular and one of haglers cornermen roger perron in an interview that took place on an episode of hbos legendary nights episode segments in  later stated that the ninth round was probably marvin haglers best round round ten was tame by comparison as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with hagler having more spectacular moments despite leonards obvious fatigue he boxed well in the eleventh every time hagler scored leonard came back with something flashier and more eyecatching if not as effective but at that point in the fight hagler appeared to be slightly more ringgeneral and clearly more aggressive between rounds eleven and twelve leonards trainer angelo dundee implored sugar ray to get up off his stool yelling we got three minutesnew champnew champ leonard yelled yeah and played to the screaming crowd haglers corner was much more reserved prompting clancy to comment theyre talking to him like its an ibm meeting or somethingno emotion in the final round hagler continued to chase leonard he hit leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner leonard responded with a furious flurry landing few punches but whipping the upsethoping crowd into a frenzy hagler backed off and leonard danced away with hagler in pursuit the fight ended with hagler and leonard exchanging along the ropes at the final bell even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding leonards effort leonard threw  punches and landed  while hagler threw  and landed  leonard was awarded a controversial splitdecision judge dave moretti scored it – for leonard while judge lou filippo had it – for hagler judge josé guerra scored the fight – for leonard many felt that hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches scottish boxing journalist hugh mcilvanney wrote that leonards plan was to steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurrieshe was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champions gloves and arms many others felt that leonard deservedly got the decision arguing that leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship jim murray longtime sports columnist for the los angeles times wrote it wasnt even closehe didnt just outpoint hagler he exposed him he made him look like a guy chasing a bus in snowshoes leonard repeatedly beat hagler to the punch when he did he hit harder he hit more often he made hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler a swarmer a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him if you moved he was lost the fight was named fight of the year and upset of the year by the ring despite requests from the hagler camp leonard was uninterested in a rematch and

judge jerry roth scored the fight – for hearns judge tom kazmarek scored it – for leonard and judge dalby shirley scored it – shirley was the only judge to give leonard a – margin in the twelfth if he
