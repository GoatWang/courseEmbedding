bunk trailers to rollers  gauge steel galvanized finish rubber rollers for boats weighing up to  lbs the advantage of this style of roller bunks is that each set of rollers is wider  rollers instead of  providing more contact with the boat the rollers on this style of bunk do not have wobble capability for selfalignment like model  does the rated capacity is based on having good contact with all of the rollers and a reasonably even distribution of weight on the rollers rollers must be in contact with straight sections of the boat hull it is critical to avoid a very large load on the first set of rollers during the unloading and loading process the boat should float at least part way onto the trailer before contacting rollers so that all of its weight is not concentrated on the first set of rollers a concentrated load can crush a single set of rollers with the potential for damage to the boat hull  email friendspecifications and model comparison price   « previous  next » products   air
