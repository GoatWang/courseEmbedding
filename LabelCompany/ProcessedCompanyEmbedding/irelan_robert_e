copending us provisional patent application ser no 00 filed jul   field of the invention the present invention is directed to a mechanical pencil background of the invention mechanical pencils are known see for example us pat nos 0 0 0 0  00  0  and us publication no  these mechanical pencils are however complex and difficult to assemble there is a need for a mechanical pencil that is easily assembled and has few components summary of the invention the instant invention is a mechanical pencil the pencil includes a body having a cavity and a lead holding mechanism located in the cavity the lead holding mechanism includes a pair of arms joined together by a bridge each arm terminates with a pair of fingers the fingers close together when the lead holding mechanism is recessed into the cavity the fingers open when the lead holding mechanism is advanced out of the cavity description of the drawings for the purpose of illustrating the invention there is shown in the drawings a form that is presently preferred it being understood however that this invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities shown fig  is an isometric view of an embodiment of the present invention fig  is an exploded view of the embodiment shown in fig  figs a and b are detailed views of the embodiment shown in fig  fig  is a sectional view of the embodiment shown in fig  with the lead holding mechanism recessed within the body fig  is a sectional view of the embodiment shown in fig  with the lead holding mechanism advanced out of the body detailed description of the invention referring to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements there is shown in fig  an embodiment of the mechanical pencil 0 mechanical pencil 0 is preferably a carpenters pencil but is not so limited pencil 0 generally comprises a body  having a first body component  and a second body component  which when joined together define a cavity  best seen in figs  and  a lead holding mechanism 0 best seen in figs   and  is located within cavity  a cap  is located at one end of body  cap  optionally may include a clip  body  optionally may include grip surfaces  as a part of body components  and  body components  and  and cap  may be made of a rigid thermoplastic such as acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene abs body components  and  are joined together for example by welding thermal or ultrasonic gluing or mechanically referring to fig  lead holding mechanism 0 is seen in greater detail lead holding mechanism 0 generally comprises a pair of arms 0 and  arms 0 and  generally parallel to one another and spaced apart a bridge  joins arms 0 and  bridge  may be located off the center of arms 0 and  each arm 0 and  terminates with a pair of fingers  and 0 fingers  are associated with arm  fingers 0 are associated with arm 0 the fingers may be set at an acute angle to a line defined by their associated arms as best seen in figures  and  the fingers may be integrally molded to arms and may be flexible as will be more fully explained below catch  and stop  may be located on each arm 0 and  at the end of the arms opposite the fingers  and 0 catch  and stop  may be adapted to engage cap  via slots not shown in cap  and to fasten lead holding mechanism 0 to cap  for reasons more fully explained below lead holding mechanism 0 may be made of a thermoplastic material that is flexible such as polypropylene a spring  may be located within cavity  a spring rest  is formed within cavity  and is optionally an integrally molded part of body components  and  one end of spring  may sit on spring rest  and the other end may engage cap  referring to figs a and b clamp surfaces  and  are seen in greater detail clamp surface  optionally joins together fingers  and 0 clamp surface  in another embodiment not shown may be divided eg in half between arms 0  so that fingers  and 0 are not joined clamp surface  generally has an inverted ‘u’ shaped cross section the ‘u’ may be sized to receive and to hold when clamp surfaces  and  are closed a lead  clamp surface  optionally joins fingers  and  clamp surface  in another embodiment not shown may be divided eg in half between arms 0  so that fingers  and 0 are not joined clamp surface  has a generally planar surface which when closed mates with the open side of clamp surface  optionally at least one tooth  may be located on the planar surface of clamp surface  the use of this tooth  will be discussed in greater detail below again referring to figs a and b lead  is shown in greater detail lead  has a generally rectangular cross section optionally corners of lead  may be rounded or beveled one surface 0 of lead  has a plurality of grooves therein the grooves are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lead  the grooves are adapted to engaged the teeth  of clamp surface  when the grooves engage the teeth  and the clamp surfaces  and  are closed the lead  is held in place between the clamp surfaces  and  lead  may be made of any lead chalk crayon or grease material as is well known in the art lead  in one embodiment may be a mixture of graphite and clay referring to figs  and  the operation of pencil 0 will be discussed in fig  pencil 0 is shown with the lead holding mechanism 0 recessed within cavity  note that the clamp surfaces  and  are closed which is caused by flexible fingers  and 0 being depressed by the inner walls of body components  and  as the holding mechanism is drawn into cavity  in the closed position lead  is held firmly in place additionally cap  is at its furthermost point of travel away from body  and spring  is relatively relaxed ie the spring may be under a slight compressive load in fig  cap  is depressed onto body  note arrow a spring  is compressed lead holding mechanism 0 is advanced out of cavity  and fingers  and 0 are allowed to open in the opened position lead  may be inserted into pencil 0 or advanced in or out of pencil 0 when cap  is released note arrow b spring  returns to its relatively relaxed position and draws lead holding mechanism 0 into cavity  and fingers  and 0 close the present invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit and the essential attributes thereof and accordingly reference should be made to the appended claims rather than to
