b�er cond philharmonia orch dimitra theodossiou dmitry korchak andrew fosterwilliams camilla roberts cora burggraaf james westman mark wilde etc opera rara orr  includes elaborate pp librettobook final copy   critic reviews�anticipation is always great for new opera rara releases because the mixture of excellent studio conditions and superb packaging always makes for a luxury product on top of that we get to know interesting works from a fascinating period of music history � ones which have fallen by the wayside either because of poor librettos difficult performance conditions at the premiere or a negative critical receptionthis new cd federico riccis corrado daltamura is no exception its beautifully produced and contains excellent playing and some highquality singing and for sure the work deserves reconsideration � so much so that one wishes that opera rara could give the piece a complete recording rather than just highlights though the whole libretto is included in the lavish booklet were told that this piece was a favourite of patric schmid the late artistic director and former driving force of opera rara and its to him that the recording is dedicatedone can see why he liked the opera so much ricci had written six operas when he came to compose corrado but he was still struggling to establish himself as a writer of opere serie the failure of un duello sotto richelieu in  upset the composer so much that he fell silent for two years returning to the fray only in 4 with michelangelo e rolla notable for featuring verdis future wife giuseppina streponi in the lead female role la scala was then captivated later in the year with corrado putting ricci on the map with the criticsthe works serious tone is indeed striking from the dark grave prelude to the spellbinding final scene ricci is capable of great complexity including the interweaving of the voices with different instrumental lines in the orchestra and sophisticated largescale structures jeremy commons notes in his liner essay that the choice of ostinato figures in riccis score is unusually nuanced as well as a sense of the theatrical listen to the trumpet blares trombone scales and cymbal crashes at the start of the firstact finale to witness a composer with a forwardthinking attitude to vivid opera orchestration there is such promise in the work that its a shame that ricci did not take his career further all but one of his remaining operas it seems was unsuccessful at his premiere and as we know his works have all but sunk into obliviontop marks here to roland bo�r and the philharmonia orchestra for providing a nearideal accompaniment in this recording theres such vitality about the playing that one would imagine the orchestra had the theatre in its blood rather than spending most of its time in the concert hall boers tempo choices tend to be sprightly but never rushed and he breathes with his singers� dominic mchugh�frederico riccis corrado daltamura is a dramma lirico that opened at la scala in 4 set in thcentury sicily the highly dramatic plot tells of betrayal and then revenge between roggero the duke of agrigento and his former friend and tutor corrado to whose daughter delizia roggero has promised marriage  only to break his vows the great expert in thcentury italian opera julian budden thought riccis serious works �are worthy to stand beside mercadantes� this is the sixth opera in the essential opera rara series and once again a vivid impression of the work is captured on a single disc accompanied by a complete libretto and article by the eminent th century musical scholar jeremy commons� the guardian�riccis orchestral writing is remarkably original and he has a fine sense of theatre the closing scene in which delizia now a nun denies roggero sanctuary in her convent and hands him over to a bloodthirsty lynch mob has considerable power� gramophone�the tenor here is the young clearvoiced and stylish dmitry korchak corrado is james westman a baritone well supplied with high aflats for his cabaletta and with a well placed voice sometimes recalling sherrill milnes dimitra theodossiouhas a comparably strong dramatic instinct the voice is well contrasted with the lighter soprano of cora burggraaf who plays margarita the �other woman� good work by orchestra and chorus under roland b�er who shows a sure feeling for the style�

of lawcorrado malberti università degli studi di trento  faculty of law date written january   abstract this paper explores the italian reform of corporate governance of  which for the first time allowed corporations to choose among three different models of governance in part inspired by foreign legal systems italian corporations have three governance options first corporations may adopt the italian traditional system of governance which has been modernized by the reform of corporate law this model of governance is still the most influential and most commonly used in italy besides the traditional model two other alternative systems of governance were created by the  reform the twotier system and the onetier system the first model owes its basic structure to the german tradition where the shareholders meeting appoints a supervisory board which then appoints a management board in contrast the onetier model derives from the angloamerican tradition in this system the shareholders meeting appoints the board of directors which then appoints a number of directors to an audit committee entrusted with monitoring functions taking into account the initial goals of the italian legislator in designing the  reform we illustrate how the models have been implemented in italian practice and describe the initial predictions of their benefits and disadvantages then we provide some empirical evidence of the practical consequences of the italian reform of corporate governance three years after its enactment and we investigate whether the predictions mentioned above were accurate keywords corporate law corporate governance board structure italy european community european union ec company law comparative freedom of contract regulatory competition convergence
