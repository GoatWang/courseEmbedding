reports fiscal  first quarter results news provided by panhandle oil and gas inc feb    et share this article oklahoma city feb   prnewswire  panhandle oil and gas inc nyse phx the company today reported financial and operating results for the  fiscal first quarter ending dec   significant items for first quarter  recorded first quarter  net loss of   per share compared to net loss of   per share for the  first quarter recorded production of  mcfe compared to  mcfe for the  first quarter funded capital expenditures of  million for drilling and equipping wells for the  first quarter with cash generated by operating activities of  million during the quarter collected  million from leasing mineral acreage in the  first quarter reduced debt  million in the  first quarter for the  first quarter the company recorded a net loss of   per share compared to a net loss of   per share for the  first quarter net cash provided by operating activities decreased  to  for the  first quarter compared to the  first quarter cash flow from operating activities fully funded all capital expenditures of  for drilling and equipping wells for the quarter total revenues for the  first quarter were  compared to  for the  first quarter the decrease was largely due to increased losses on derivative contracts of   million of noncash marktomarket in the  quarter as nymex oil and natural gas futures experienced more of an increase in price in relation to the collars and the fixed price swaps oil ngl and natural gas sales decreased  or  in the  quarter compared to the  quarter as a result of a  decrease in mcfe production mostly offset by a  increase in the average sales price per mcfe of production sales prices for oil ngl and natural gas increased   and  respectively for the  first quarter when compared to the  first quarter the average sales price per mcfe during the  first quarter was  compared to  for the  first quarter compared to the  first quarter first quarter  oil production decreased  to  barrels ngl production decreased  to  barrels and natural gas production decreased  to  mcf these production volume declines are the result of normal decline in the companys producing wells drilling and completion capital expenditures for the last year have been below levels required to add new production sufficient to offset this natural decline lease operating expenses decreased  in the  quarter as compared to the  quarter the reduction was mostly the result of decreased production and operating efficiencies depreciation depletion and amortization dda decreased  mainly due to lower production and the dda rate per mcfe decreasing  in the  quarter the rate decrease was primarily due to impairment expense in fiscal  lowering our depreciable basis there was no impairment expense booked in the  quarter compared to approximately  million in the  quarter operations update drilling is now underway on five separate projects three are in the cores of lowrisk resource plays and the other two are in higher risk plays in the permian basin in the stackcana play the company is participating with a  working interest and a  net revenue interest in six woodford shale wells operated by cimarex energy the first two wells have been drilled wells three and four are drilling and wells five and six are scheduled to spud as soon as three and four finish drilling cimarex plans to drill all six wells before beginning completion operations these wells are expected to be completed and start producing in the third quarter of  in the southeastern oklahoma woodford shale panhandle is participating with an average  working interest and an average  net revenue interest in eight wells operated by bp six wells have been drilled and the last two are drilling four of these wells are currently being completed and are expected to begin production within the next  days the remaining four wells are projected to be completed and start producing early in the third quarter of  drilling has commenced with one rig on a tenwell continuous drilling program on our eagle ford leasehold the first two wells are projected to be completed and start producing in april  the next four wells are expected to start producing in the fourth quarter of  and the remaining four wells should be on production during the first quarter of  we own an average  working interest and  net revenue interest in these ten wells the activity in these three lowrisk resource plays is expected to result in a material increase in daily oil ngl and natural gas production as these wells begin to produce throughout the remainder of  and into  this activity will also result in a material increase in  capital expenditures as compared to  in the permian basin qep resources is currently drilling a twomile lateral woodford shale well on our contiguous squaremile mineral holdings in andrews and winkler counties texas panhandle has leased its  net mineral acres in the block and is entitled to a proportionately reduced  royalty we also have the right to participate with up to  working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed with full participation panhandle would have a  working interest and a  net revenue interest in wells drilled on the squaremile block also in the permian basin element petroleum is evaluating the san andres formation on a contiguous squaremile acreage block in cochran county texas panhandle leased  net mineral acres within this block to element and has a proportionately reduced  royalty we also have the right to participate with up to  working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed with full participation panhandle would have a  working interest and a  net revenue interest in wells drilled on the squaremile block thus far element has drilled and cored four pilot wells and completed one salt water disposal well on and around our block the operator has begun the process of reentering the pilot holes and drilling mile laterals to test the san andres formation the first lateral is being drilled and is scheduled to begin producing within the next  days element is in the process of staking an additional  locations on and around our block and plan to begin development activities if the initial wells are successful hedging activities prices received for oil ngl and natural gas improved during the quarter and recent nymex futures pricing suggests continued improvement for the remainder of  to protect cash flows generated by the materially increased capital expenditures planned for  and support the returns on those investments panhandle has elected to hedge a significant amount of projected  production we have  bcf and  bcf of natural gas volumes for the remainder of  and  hedged with costless collars with average floors of  and  per mcf and average ceilings of  and  per mcf respectively we also have  bcf and  bcf of natural gas volumes for the remainder of  and  hedged with swap contracts with average prices of  and  respectively the company has also hedged  barrels of remaining  oil with costless collars with an average floor price of  per barrel and an average ceiling price of  and  barrels of oil with swap contracts that have an average price of  the aforementioned timeframes are based on calendar year management comments paul f blanchard jr president and ceo said like many other oil and gas companies panhandle experienced declining sales in  due to low capital expenditures in the low product price environment prices for oil ngl and natural gas improved during first quarter  and recent nymex futures pricing suggests continued improvement for the remainder of  as a result we are experiencing a substantial increase in activity on our holdings the company has three lowrisk highpotential projects under development including drilling in the stackcana woodford shale the southeastern oklahoma woodford shale and the eagle ford shale this activity is expected to produce material increases in daily oil ngl and natural gas production as these wells come on line in  and into  this activity will also result in a material increase in  capital expenditures as compared to  we are evaluating higher risk exploration areas on our mineral acreage in the woodford shale in andrews and winkler counties texas and the san andres formation in cochran county texas in both of these projects we have the right to participate with up to  working interest in each unit as initial unit wells are proposed in addition to our proportionately reduced  royalty if successful these two permian basin plays have the potential to become panhandle core areas going forward we expect improved product prices along with material new oil ngl and natural gas production from the lowrisk drilling in the cores of our existing resource plays in  we also have the possibility of adding two highpotential plays in the permian basin which are currently being evaluated as new active core areas this multiproject and balancedrisk approach continues to demonstrate the value of panhandles proven operating strategies which have positioned the company to prosper as the industry begins

correct they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under risk factors in part  item  of panhandles  form k filed with the securities and exchange commission these risk factors include the worldwide economic recessions continuing negative effects on the natural gas business panhandles hedging activities may reduce the realized prices received for natural gas sales the volatility of oil and gas prices the companys ability to compete effectively against strong independent oil and gas companies and majors the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund reserve replacement costs panhandles ability to replace reserves and sustain production uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves unsuccessful exploration and development drilling decreases in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in writedowns the negative impact lower oil and gas prices could have on our ability to borrow drilling and operating risks and we cannot control activities on our properties as the company is a nonoperator do not place undue reliance on these
