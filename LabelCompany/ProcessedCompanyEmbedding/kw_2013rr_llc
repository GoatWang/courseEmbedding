pollutant class the peak output is still  kw  hp at  rpm and the maximum torque of  lbft  nm is reached at  rpm in the interests of excellent rideability the new rr also has a wide engine speed range

safety when braking on bends here abs pro available in the modes “rain” “sport” and “race” is able to prevent the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly this reduces abrupt
