the imperfectly perfect or perfectly imperfect marriage of director and actor blake edwards’ the pink panther film collection starring peter sellers is a riotously entertaining romp through six of the zaniest capers ever lensed there’s never been a better time to think pink” – joe marchese the digital bits “shout factory has outdone themselves with this release the best films of the bunch sport fresh new k scans as well as multiple audio tracks to choose from on top of strong av presentation for each film there are hours of terrific bonus features for fans to pick through as this series of films feature sellers best comedic efforts the pink panther film collection is a fans delight and should be considered highly recommended” – matthew hartman highdef digest “blake edward’s the pink panther film collection starring peter sellers is a pure joy there have been previous boxsets but they didn’t include the return of the pink panther since it had a different distributor now they are united and all look so marvelous…now with all the bonus features you can get a sense of the rush that greeted the movies when sellers returned to the role in the ’s” – joe corey inside pulse “the pink panther films are a compulsively bingeable series and shout factory’s new bluray set is a fantastic way to do just that every film arrives in a great transfer and on its own disc packed with extra
