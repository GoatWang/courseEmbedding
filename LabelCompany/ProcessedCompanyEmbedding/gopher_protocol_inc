with access to conventional networks wifi and cellular our gopherinsight microchips will be installed on billions of mobile devices by the year  this will allow goph to create its own private communication network which will enormously benefit the user from behind the scenes we utilize this private network to improve the computing power database management internal memory and security of mobile devices equipped with gopherinsight microchips the potential is enormous and we are constantly developing more advanced features the guardian patch is derived from gopherinsight microchips and is one example of how goph products will benefit users via the guardiantracking technology family the guardian patch can track your location anywhere on earth – with or without gps service – with

assistance or intervention in order to enhance the performance security rf capabilities and power consumption of our microchip technology we implemented iot methodologies within our eda computer program epsilon and sigma each one of these technologies are used during integrated circuit design for a wide variety of design enhancements we added a feature called “iot aware” which uniquely considers iot challenges during chip design stages this is the first time that an eda software includes iot awareness during the design of integrated circuits our goal is to create a family of devices that are internet of things native and controlled via our embedded software in various systems our devices represent themselves digitally and can be controlled from anywhere goph products are connected to our private secured communication protocol and enable our technology to control and manage more data from more places this will ensure greater efficiency of digital and interpersonal

specializes in the development of internet of things iot and artificial intelligence enabled mobile technologies announces a new release of its software product epsilon the goal of epsilon is to introduce improvements in the semiconductor development and design industrygophers initial assessment suggests that epsilon may allow semiconductor manufacturers to speed up the development process of chips as well as provide for the optimization of chip design so that it uses less powerepsilon does this by enabling designers to identify and correct faulty spots early during the design stages gopher believes that epsilon may be able reduce development time for a chip by  which could offer significant potential savings for chip manufacturersfurthermore gopher expects that using epsilon will enable microchip designers to design more powerefficient chipsepsilon completes an onthefly analysis for electrical constraints during integrated circuit ic early design stages and suggests a method for correction of such constraints this early detection eliminates problems that would be more expensive to address later in the development cyclethis release includes special algorithms that were especially targeted to analyze performance and power consumption of microchips that are designed for mobile and iot domains the requirements for these type of ics is to comply with higher standards of lowpower and highperformance for these types of circuitry and functionality epsilon includes a new mode called iot aware which specifically addresses these types of ics which fall within the rf and mixed design typesgopher protocol is pleased to announce that several semiconductor companies are in ongoing evaluation of the technology with live evaluation set to begin by the beginning of june
