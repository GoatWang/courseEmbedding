of your competitors i come across my information via public means mind you but i do read what google alerts tells me i was rightly surprised but inside delighted to see that in april  varonis systems inc nasdaqvrns initiated an app in conjunction with the great ecosystem provided by splunk inc nasdaq splk as i have been within corporate security and their related ecosystems for many years – i never understood why those same ‘security vendors’ didn’t integrate to the rest of the ecosystem in my opinion if you are not helping the ciso cio cto ‘sweat their existing assets’ more and more – you are just yet another bolt on solution that does little other than perhaps deliver on your functionality and create yet another stove pipe silo of information that’s why when i started classidocs in  we purposebuilt the integration for any siem to consume our data feeds on a live and ongoing basis – the information is just that valuable to it and orchestration systems indeed i couldn’t see building anything today that didn’t tie into other de facto standards that every customer would have – it really would be negligent as a product in my opinion so i welcome this and other players to the current generation of security operations – exposing the largest set of information risks a business has unstructured datasets to the platforms that can directly respond and otherwise action the problem – siems in general – ibm hp splunk alienvault and others i just wonder who will be next to add ransomware detection alerting to siem platforms or governance exceptions to orchestration platforms directly or structured data classifications or data at rest performance calculations or dynamic classifications based on artificial intelligence and end user feedbacktraining we’ve been doing all of that and more – since day one ihub newswire bahamas development corp bdci releases updatebdci jul    pm onci inks major dealonci jul    pm pura  puration takes strategic step on eve of
