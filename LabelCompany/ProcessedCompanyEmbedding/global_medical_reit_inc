of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included herein including the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the section entitled cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements in this report as discussed in more detail in the section entitled cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements this discussion contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements background global medical reit inc the company us we our was incorporated in the state of nevada on march   and redomiciled into a maryland corporation effective january   our principal investment strategy is to develop and manage a portfolio of real estate assets in the healthcare industry which includes surgery centers specialty hospitals and outpatient treatment centers we formed our operating partnership in march  and contributed all of our thenowned healthcare facilities to the operating partnership in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership we own global medical reit gp llc a delaware limited liability company which is the sole general partner of our operating partnership we intend to conduct all future acquisition activity and operations through our operating partnership on july   the company closed its initial public offering and issued  shares of its common stock at a price of  per share resulting in net proceeds of  recent developments we completed eight acquisitions during the current quarter during the three months ended march   we completed eight acquisitions a summary description of the facilities acquired is contained in note   property portfolio to the notes to consolidated financial statements trends which may influence results of operations we believe the following trends in the healthcare real estate market positively affect the acquisition ownership development and management of healthcare real estate � growing healthcare expenditures � an aging population � a continuing shift towards outpatient care � implementation of the affordable care act � physician practice group and hospital consolidation � healthcare industry employment growth � expected monetization and modernization of healthcare real estate � a highly fragmented healthcare real estate market and � a limited new supply of healthcare real estate we believe the following trends in the healthcare real estate market may negatively impact our lease revenues and the ability to make distributions to our shareholders � changes in demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services � changes in third party reimbursement methods and policies and � increased scrutiny of billing referral and other practices by us federal and state authorities    components of the companys revenues expenses and cash flows revenue rental revenue our operations currently consist of rental revenue earned from our tenantoperators under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations the leases have been accounted for as operating leases for operating leases with contingent rental escalators revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment if we determine that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established additionally the capitalized abovemarket lease intangible is amortized as a reduction of rental revenue and the belowmarket lease intangible is amortized as an addition to rental revenue over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases other income other income consists primarily of interest income earned on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering expenses acquisition fees acquisition fees represent expenses incurred with unaffiliated entities related to the acquisition of a facility primarily incurred with acquisitions that are accounted for as business combinations acquisition fees  related party acquisition fees  related party represented a fee paid by us to our advisor for facility acquisitions in connection with the terms of the original management agreement in accordance with the provisions of the amended and restated management agreement which became effective july   the advisor ceased charging us this acquisition fee general and administrative general and administrative expense primarily includes professional fees and services legal and accounting general office expenses ground rent related to the omaha facility and travel and related expenses management fees  related party in accordance with the terms of the companys initial management agreement between us and the advisor we owed the advisor a base management fee equal to the greater of a  per annum of our net asset value the value of our assets less the value of our liabilities or b  per calendar month historically this fee has resulted in a monthly charge to us of  upon completion of the companys initial public offering on july   the companys amended and restated management agreement which was approved by the board on june   became effective refer to note   related party transactions for details regarding the amended and restated management agreement the management fee expense incurred for the three months ended march   and march   and accrued management fees owed to the advisor as of those dates depreciation expense depreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings site improvements and tenant improvements which are generally between  and  years amortization expense amortization expense is incurred on the companys acquired lease intangible assets consisting of inplace leases and leasing cost intangible assets and is computed using the straightline method over the remaining lives of the respective leases which are generally between  and  years    interest expense interest expense is derived from interest incurred on our borrowings from third party institutional lenders as well as borrowings from related parties the funds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions additionally the amortization of deferred financing costs debt discount incurred to obtain third party financing is classified as interest expense cash flow cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities primarily represent activities related to us conducting our normal business activities and generally reflect the impact of transactions that enter into the determination of our net income or loss cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities primarily represent activities related to us acquiring healthcare facilities plants and equipment and making and collecting loans from other entities cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities primarily represent activities related to us borrowing and subsequently repaying funds from other entities as well as providing stockholders with a return on investment primarily in the form of a dividend payment competition our healthcare facilities often face competition from nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities that provide comparable services similarly our tenantoperators face competition from other medical practices and service providers at nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities from time to time and for reasons beyond our control managedcare organizations may change their lists of preferred hospitals or innetwork physicians physicians also may change hospital affiliations if competitors of our tenantoperators or competitors of the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities are strategically aligned have greater geographic coverage improve access and convenience to physicians and patients provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities expand or improve their services or obtain more favorable managedcare contracts our tenantoperators may not be able to successfully compete any reduction in rental revenues resulting from the inability of our tenantoperators or the associated healthcare delivery systems with which our healthcare facilities are strategically aligned to compete in providing medical services andor receiving sufficient rates of reimbursement for healthcare services rendered may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock qualification as a reit our business strategy is conducive to a more favorable tax structure whereby we may qualify and elect to be treated as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we plan to elect to be taxed as reit under us federal income tax laws commencing with our taxable year ending december   we believe that commencing with  we have organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under all of the us federal income tax laws and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner however we cannot provide assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit in order to qualify as a reit a substantial percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans we must elect under the us internal revenue code the code to be treated as a reit subject to a number of significant exceptions a corporation that qualifies as a reit generally is not subject to us federal corporate income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders thereby reducing its corporate level taxes management agreement on november   we entered into a management agreement with an effective date of april   with interamerican management llc our affiliate this management agreement was amended and restated on july   see note   related party transactions for additional information on these agreements    critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note   summary of significant accounting policies in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the companys financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates purchase of real estate transactions in which real estate assets are purchased that are not subject to an existing lease are treated as asset acquisitions and are recorded at their purchase price including capitalized acquisition costs which is allocated to land and building based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition transactions in which real estate assets are acquired either subject to an existing lease or as part of a portfolio level transaction with significant leasing activity are treated as a business combination under accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed including identified intangible assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair value fair value is determined based upon the guidance of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures and generally are determined using level  inputs such as rent comparables sales comparables and broker indications although level  inputs are utilized they are minor in comparison to the level  data used for the primary assumptions the determination of fair value involves the use of significant judgment and estimates we make estimates to determine the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information obtained from multiple sources including preacquisition due diligence and we routinely utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser initial valuations are subject to change until the information is finalized no later than  months from the acquisition date we expense transaction costs associated with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations in the period incurred details regarding the valuation of tangible assets the fair value of land is determined using the sales comparison approach whereby recent comparable land sales and listings are gathered and summarized the available market data is analyzed and compared to the land being valued and adjustments are made for dissimilar characteristics such as market conditions size and location we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an asifvacant basis and depreciate the building value over its estimated remaining life we determine the fair value of site improvements nonbuilding improvements that include paving and other using the cost approach with a deduction for depreciation and depreciate the site improvements over their estimated remaining useful lives tenant improvements represent fixed improvements to tenant spaces the fair value of which is estimated using prevailing market tenant improvement allowances that would be given to attract a new tenant estimated based on the assumption that it is a necessary cost of leasing up a vacant building tenant improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease details regarding the valuation of intangible assets in determining the fair value of inplace leases the avoided cost associated with existing inplace leases management considers current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in arriving at an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected leaseup period from vacant to existing occupancy in estimating carrying costs management includes reimbursable based on market lease terms real estate taxes insurance other operating expenses as well as estimates of lost market rental revenue during the expected leaseup periods the values assigned to inplace leases are amortized over the remaining term of the lease    the fair value of aboveorbelow market leases is estimated based on the present value using an interest rate which reflected the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the leases and managements estimate of market lease rates measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining term of the lease an above market lease is classified as an intangible asset and a below market lease is classified as an intangible liability the capitalized abovemarket or belowmarket lease intangibles are amortized as a reduction of or an addition to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases the capitalized abovemarket lease intangible is amortized as a reduction of rental revenue and the belowmarket lease intangible is amortized as an addition to rental revenue over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases intangible assets related to leasing costs consist of leasing commissions and legal fees leasing commissions are estimated by multiplying the remaining contract rent associated with each lease by a market leasing commission legal fees represent legal costs associated with writing reviewing and sometimes negotiating various lease terms leasing costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the respective leases impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its real estate assets for impairment periodically or whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable if an impairment indicator exists we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of an asset if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset revenue recognition the companys operations currently consist of rental revenue earned from tenants under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations these leases are accounted for as operating leases for operating leases with contingent rental escalators revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease term subject to a collectability assessment if the company determines that collectability of rents is not reasonably assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established the company consistently assesses the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments the company also monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for operating lease straightline rent amounts the companys assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease as of march   and december   no allowance was recorded as it was not deemed necessary fair value of financial instruments fair value is a marketbased measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in accordance with asc topic  the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement the company considers the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents escrow deposits accounts and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time since origination or the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization due to the shortterm nature of these instruments level  and level  inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments the fair values determined related to the companys transactions that are accounted for as business combinations primarily utilizes level  inputs since there is heavy reliance on market observable data such as rent comparables sales comparables and broker indications although some level  inputs are utilized they are minor in comparison to the level  date used for the primary assumptions as it relates to business combination valuations    stockbased compensation the company expenses the fair value of unit awards in accordance with the fair value recognition requirements of asc topic  compensationstock compensation and asc topic  equity under asc topic  the companys independent directors are deemed to be employees and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized based on the price of  per unit the closing share price for the companys common stock at the closing date of the initial public offering on july   ratably over the month service period using the straight line method under asc topic  the employees of the advisor and its affiliates are deemed to be nonemployees of the company and therefore compensation expense for these units is recognized using the share price of the companys common stock at the end of the reporting period ratably over the month or month service period respectively depending on the grant terms using the straight line method annual performance awards will vest in equal portions at the end of the oneyear performance period and one year from that date longterm performance awards vest in equal portions on the completion of the threeyear performance period and on the oneyear anniversary of that date annual and longterm award targets were granted on february   consolidated results of operations the major factor that resulted in variances in our results of operations for each revenue and expense category for the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   is the fact that as of march   our portfolio consisted of facilities from a total of  acquisitions whereas as of march   only seven of the  acquisitions had occurred as of march   the company had the following properties in its portfolio from  acquisitions � oklahoma city

alphasign in  join nowgo»global medical reit is poised to profitapr  about global medical gmre brad thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummarywhile the investment strategy is unique global medical reit is also considered an outlier for its strategy of sourcing capital both domestically and internationallythis newbie in reitdom appears to be ripe for rewardalthough global medical reit is externally managed the company expects to internalize as soon as it reaches critical massi would expect the company to normalize its payout ratio in the low s rangesubscribers to reit beat had early access to this article the author purchased shares prior to publishing this article at a price of  per share according to reitcom when global medical reit nysemktgmre went public last summer the company set its sights on a specific niche within the health care real estate sector licensed medical treatment facilities the company focuses on transactions in the range of  million and ceo david young sees a steady flow of acquisition opportunities coming from smaller cities and rural locations the bethesda marylandbased reit focuses on medical practices that deliver core medical procedures such as cardiovascular treatment cosmetic plastic surgery eye surgery gastroenterology oncology treatment and orthopedics some would argue that gmre is a nichebased reit that pursues an asset class thats underserved rather than more crowded categories such as assisted living senior housing and medical office while the investment strategy is unique gmre is also considered an outlier for its strategy of sourcing capital both domestically and internationally according to the companys ceo david young there are no other reits in our space that are sourcing capital internationally i think that does give us a competitive edge prior to listing shares gmre was established in  when hong kongbased zh international holdings ltd provided the first tranche of private equity gmre spent  months to build a portfolio worth about  million by using private equity and bank leverage in  the company raised  million through an ipo and a few months later it secured a  million syndicated bank line of credit and an accordion feature for an additional  million at the end of  gmre had acquired  million of assets and it purchased approximately  million of assets in the first quarter of  this newbie in reitdom appears to be ripe for reward and this is why i chose the article global medical reit is poised to profit image credit company overview gmre is focused on the acquisition and leasing of stateoftheart purposebuilt healthcare facilities the facilities are built or adapted to contemporary best healthcare practices and the company targets the factory where core medical procedures are delivered gmre leases to leading medical providers with dominant local market share it also focuses on singletenant net lease real estate the current portfolio consists of  facilities netleased to fourteen tenants the portfolio includes approximately  square feet of leasable area with leases averaging  years or remaining term  years average age of portfolio  the youngest of listed healthcare reits the reits closes peer is medical properties trust nysempw but gmre does not invest in ambulatory properties like mpw gmre executives have robust relationships with healthcare providers allowing for direct negotiation and generation of new longterm leases without broker intermediaries heres a snapshot of the companys portfolio as of  gmre targets annual base rent of  of projected total investment cost and leases typically have  annual rent escalations most leases are absolute nnn leases with  year initial lease terms because the leases are nnn there is minimal recurring capex exposure and minimal asset management expenses the company also insists on credit enhancements to mitigate risks subordination of tenant physician salaries and medical practice profit distributions to timely payment of rent licenses cons certificates of need stay with the real estate in the event of change in occupancy personal corporate sponsor guarantees andor thirdparty letters of credit high rent coverage ratios ebitdarm required of tenant for security gmre has right to evict and replace management of medical provider tenant crosscollateralization for portfolio investments by gmre with same operator comprehensive tenant reporting requirements and annual audits gmre has the youngest assets of listed healthcare reit peers driving highquality tenant retention the portfolio has no lease rollovers until  and the average annual base rent per square foot is  management team looks solid i took a look at gmres investor deck and i see that the management team has deep experience in healthcare for example the companys ceo has over  years of experience and was formerly vp at windrose medical properties trust wrs which was acquired by welltower nysehcn he was also an executive responsible for business development for healthcare property investors nysehcp and helped it grow from aum of  million to over  billion i also noticed there were a few heavyhitting board members including matthew cypher phd professor at georgetown universitys mcdonough school of business as the director of the real estate finance initiative another notable board member includes ronald marston founder and ceo of healthcare corporation of america otcpkhcca management company originally a subsidiary of hospital corporation of america nysehca latest earnings gmre has just one quarter of earnings under its belt but the results were promising the q highlights included total revenue increased to  million from  million net loss increased to  million from  million funds from operations of  per share adjusted funds from operations affo of  per share occupancy rate of  at both december   and december   during the first quarter gmre closed on acquisitions totaling approximately  million bringing its gross investments to approximately  million and an additional  million of acquisitions currently under contract clearly the reit is out of the gates with strong growth potential and likely strong shareholder returns although gmre is externally managed the company expects to internalize as soon as it reaches critical mass it continues to reduce ga and the path to internalization  million is obvious a small cap poised to profit heres a snapshot of gmres market cap compared to the healthcare reit peers as you can see below the dividend yield is attractive  while gmres dividend is not covered by current earnings ffoshare  the growth estimates provide a clear indication that the company will be able to cover its dividend in late  heres a snapshot of forecasted ffo using fast graph estimates same data using  gmres dividend is currently  per annualized at  per share based on estimates for  the company is likely to generate  per share which translates into a forwardlooking payout ratio of  given the composition of nnn leases in gmres portfolio i would expect the company to normalize its payout ratio in the low s range in summary gmre could be the underdog and i am initiating a buy keep in mind smallcap companies are exposed to more volatility and for that reason i am maintaining speculative  concentration clearly the market has not picked up on gmre so i need to get a seat on the train before it chugs off you can view all of my rhino reit ratings by subscribing to reit beat here author note brad thomas is a wall
