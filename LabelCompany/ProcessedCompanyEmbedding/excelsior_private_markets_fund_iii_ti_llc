although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit conflicts arise from or as a result of the contractual relationship between the funds and ust each officer may also be an officer or employee of ust or its affiliates as a result this code recognizes that the officers will in the normal course of their duties whether formally for the funds or for ust or for both be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on ust and the funds the participation of the officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the funds and ust and is consistent with the performance by the officers of their duties as officers of the funds thus if performed in conformity with the provisions of the
