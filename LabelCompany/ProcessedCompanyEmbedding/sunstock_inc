acquisition corporation “sunstock” or “the company” was incorporated on july   under the laws of the state of delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions sunstock operations to date have been limited to issuing shares of its common stock sunstock may attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with sunstock the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that sunstock will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company   in december  the company purchased  ounces of silver in  the company purchased additional precious metals for  and shifting more of its capital to the acquisition of precious metals the company holds physical coins and bullion rather than contracts for delivery of precious metals or certificates in time of economic crisis there may be no guarantee of the delivery of precious metals as contracts and certificates may exceed available stock   currently the company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment depending on market conditions the company anticipates holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds  likewise the company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the market price exceeds    basis of presentation   the condensed balance sheet as of december   which has been derived from audited financial statements and the interim unaudited condensed financial statements as of march   and  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap for interim financial information and with the instructions to securities and exchange commission “sec” form q and article  of sec regulation sx these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements therefore these unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   included in the company’s form k   the condensed financial statements included herein as of and for the three months ended march   and  are unaudited however they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that in the opinion of the company’s management are necessary to present fairly the condensed financial position of the company as of march   the condensed results of its operations and cash flows for the three months ended march   and  and the condensed cash flows for the three months ended march   and  the results of operations for three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods          use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates made by the company’s management include but are not limited to valuation of marketable securities realizability of inventories and value of stockbased transactions   inventories   inventories consist of merchandise for sale and are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a firstin firstout fifo method when a purchase contains multiple copies of the same item they are stated at average cost   inventories – silver consists primarily of silver and small amounts of gold held for sale and are stated at cost currently the company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment depending on market conditions the company anticipates holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds  likewise the company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the market price exceeds    at each balance sheet date the company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for excess quantities and obsolescence among other factors the company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offerings market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value in addition the company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net realizable value of its inventory provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values once established writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards certification asc” topic  accordingly the company recognizes revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists product delivery and acceptance have occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the transaction is assured   earnings loss per common share   basic earnings loss per share represent income loss available to common stockholders divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period which excluded unvested restricted stock diluted earnings loss per share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued as well as any adjustment to income loss that would result from the assumed issuance the potential common shares that may be issued by the company relate to outstanding stock options and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share because they would reduce the reported loss per share and therefore have an antidilutive effect   as of march   there were no potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted earnings loss per share as their effect would have been antidilutive for each of the periods presented   stock based compensation   asc  “compensation  stock compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stockbased payment awards to employees including employee stock options restricted stock employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights may be classified as either equity or liabilities the company determines if a present obligation to settle the sharebased payment transaction in cash or other assets exists a present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if a the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or b the present obligation is implied because of an entity’s past practices or stated policies if a present obligation exists the transaction is recognized as a liability otherwise the transaction is recognized as equity          the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  “equity  based payments to nonemployees” measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date   note   going concern   the company has not posted operating income since inception it has an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of march   these matters raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligaons which it has not been able to accomplish to date and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties   these condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies the company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders the ability of the company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations successfully locating and negotiating with an acquisition target   there is no assurance that the company will ever be profitable the condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note   recent accounting pronouncements   see note  of our annual report on form k as of and for the year ended december   for a

the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rules this evaluation was done as of the end of the fiscal year under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s principal executive officer who is also the principal financial officer there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation based upon that evaluation he believes that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in gathering analyzing and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in its periodic reports is recorded summarized and processed timely the

evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on the criteria establish in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of march   based on those criteria a control system can provide only reasonably not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected   material weaknesses    a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   the material weaknesses identified are    inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the company’s financial statements in accordance with gaap   we did not employ an adequate number of people to ensure a control environment that would allow for the accurate and timely reporting of the financial statements    ineffective controls to ensure that the accounting for transactions are recorded in accordance with gaap financial statements   during the three months ended march   adjustments were made to the general ledger which collectively could have a material effect on the financial statements   notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting we believe that the financial statements in this quarterly

and control organization believes the complexity of the existing exceeds our internal capabilities and    plan to implement improved accounting systems   we believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting as well as our disclosure controls and procedures we intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to overcome or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until such time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed

may attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with sunstock the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that sunstock will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company   in december  the company purchased  ounces of silver in  the company purchased additional precious metals for  and shifting more of its capital to the acquisition of precious metals the company holds physical coins and bullion rather than contracts for delivery of precious metals or certificates in time of economic crisis there may be no guarantee of the delivery of precious metals as contracts and certificates may exceed available stock   currently the company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment depending on market conditions the company anticipates holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds  likewise the company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the market price exceeds    basis of presentation   the condensed balance sheet as of december   which has been derived from audited financial statements and the interim unaudited condensed financial statements as of september   and  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap for interim financial information and with the instructions to securities and exchange commission “sec” form q and article  of sec regulation sx these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements therefore these unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   included in the company’s form k   the condensed financial statements included herein as of and for the three and nine months ended september   and  are unaudited however they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that in the opinion of the company’s management are necessary to present fairly the condensed financial position of the company as of september   the condensed results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended septmeber   and  and the condensed cash flows for the nine months ended september   and  the results of operations for the nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates made by the company’s management include but are not limited to valuation of marketable securities realizability of inventories and value of stockbased transactions          inventories   inventories consist of merchandise for sale and are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a firstin firstout fifo method when a purchase contains multiple copies of the same item they are stated at average cost   inventories – silver consists primarily of silver and small amounts of gold held for sale and are stated at cost currently the company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment depending on market conditions the company anticipates holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds  likewise the company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the market price exceeds    at each balance sheet date the company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for excess quantities and obsolescence among other factors the company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offerings market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value in addition the company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net realizable value of its inventory provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values once established writedowns are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards certification asc” topic  accordingly the company recognizes revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists product delivery and acceptance have occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the transaction is assured   earnings loss per common share   basic earnings loss per share represent income loss available to common stockholders divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period which excluded unvested restricted stock diluted earnings loss per share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued as well as any adjustment to income loss that would result from the assumed issuance the potential common shares that may be issued by the company relate to outstanding stock options and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share because they would reduce the reported loss per share and therefore have an antidilutive effect   as of september   there were no potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted earnings loss per share as their effect would have been antidilutive for each of the periods presented   stock based compensation   asc  “compensation  stock compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stockbased payment awards to employees including employee stock options restricted stock employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights may be classified as either equity or liabilities the company determines if a present obligation to settle the sharebased payment transaction in cash or other assets exists a present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if a the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or b the present obligation is implied because of an entity’s past practices or stated policies if a present obligation exists the transaction is recognized as a liability otherwise the transaction is recognized as equity   the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  “equity  based payments to nonemployees” measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date          note   going concern   the company has not posted operating income since inception it has an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of september   these matters raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations which it has not been able to accomplish to date and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties   these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies the company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders the ability of the company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations successfully locating and negotiating with an acquisition target   there is no assurance that the company will ever be profitable the condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a

with the participation of the company’s principal executive officer who is also the principal financial officer there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that

such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   the material
