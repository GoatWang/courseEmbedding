headquarters in newark delaware and key distribution points around the world supercritical fluids what are supercritical fluids and how do they work when a gas such a carbon dioxide is contained under high pressure and heated there are changes to its physical properties it becomes a supercritical fluid scf under these conditions the gas possesses the solvating power of a liquid and the diffusivity of a gas its density is similar to the density of a liquid and its very low surface tension is characteristic of a gas in short it has properties of both a gas and a liquid for this reason supercritical fluids work extremely well as a processing media for a wide variety of chemical biological and polymer matricesa powerful capability of supercritical fluid extraction sfe is the ability to precisely control which components of a complex matrix are extracted and which ones are left behind this is accomplished through precise control of several key parameters including temperature pressure flow rate and processing time it is possible to “tune” the fluid to extract those components of interest while leaving others behind additional advantages of scfs are high extraction yields and superior product purity decomposition of materials almost never occurs due to the relatively mild processing temperatures carbon dioxide which is the most commonly used scf has a critical
