kritzerland     home  cuba soundtrack patrick williams limited edition kritzerland view cart continue shopping cuba soundtrack patrick williams limited edition kritzerland composer williams patrick price  audio cd kritzerland new release product description cuba music composed and conducted by patrick williams richard lester�s  film cuba was pretty much dismissed by audiences and critics however in the years since its release people have begun to come around to its charms and the film has developed a solid following and rightfully so � it is in fact one of lester�s best and most interesting films it is visually stunning and its period detail is astonishing the films is filled with memorable performances from its large cast including sean connery brooke adams chris sarandon martin balsam hector elizando and jack weston among many others set during the buildup to the  cuban revolution the film covers the end of the batista regime and the castro takeover adding romance and thrills and intrigue to the mix sort of a cuban casablanca for the score lester turned to the great patrick williams it was as it turned out an absolutely inspired choice williams turned in an enticing exciting eclectic and excellent score the love theme is one of his most beautiful creations a haunted lament for a past romance beautifully scored with guitar and female voice taking the lead the score features a lot of driving percussion and some great dynamic dramatic cues for this cd the premiere release of the score the tracks were mastered from williams� own tapes which were in great condition we present the score as he wrote it some of the cues did not make the film or were truncated � at the time of the film�s release williams did a rough version of an album presentation that obviously never happened editing a few cues together for musical cohesion we�ve left those edited cues the way he did them and have sequenced the score into what we hope is the best listening experience � while much of it is in film sequence order we�ve moved a few things around to help balance the presentation as a bonus track we�ve included williams� wonderful arrangement of the fainwebster song �a certain smile� which appears as source music in the film in an important scene patrick williams has had an amazing career that is still going strong today he began scoring films in  with how sweet it is and since then he�s been prolific in both film and television � here is just a small sampling of his great work don�t drink the water the streets of san francisco incident in san francisco my personal favorite san francisco international apparently pat was the goto guy for all things san francisco the magician the harrad summer cannon mary tyler moore the bob newhart show the one and only casey�s shadow the cheap detective and many more williams like quincy jones johnny mandel and lalo schifrin also crossed over into the worlds of arranging for singers as well as jazz � his jazzbig band albums are fantastic and highly recommended � dreams and themes threshhold th avenue and sinatraland this release is limited to  copies only cuba first sight truck drivejulio runs for it alex remembers i
