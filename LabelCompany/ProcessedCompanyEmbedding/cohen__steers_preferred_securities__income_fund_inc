investors to risks in general the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds including credit risk and interestrate risk as nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations in addition investors face equitylike risks such as deferral or omission of distributions subordination to bonds and other more senior debt and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rights the fund is classified as a “nondiversified” fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund  however the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the us tax laws risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments in particular in the event of bankruptcy a company’s preferred securities are senior to common  stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt  throughout this presentation we will make comparisons of preferred securities to corporate bonds municipal bonds and year treasury bonds  it is important to note that corporate bonds sit higher in the capital structure than preferred securities and therefore in the event of bankruptcy will be senior to the preferred securities  municipal bonds are issued and backed by state and local governments and their agencies and the interest from municipal securities is often free from both state and local income taxes  year treasury bonds are issued by the us government and are generally considered the safest of all bonds since theyre backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as to timely payment of principal and interest the fund may invest in below investmentgrade securities and unrated securities judged to be below investmentgrade by the advisor  below investmentgrade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk of loss of income and principal and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry conditions than higher grade securities  the fund’s benchmarks do not contain below investmentgrade securities no representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved for us residents only for funds with at least a year history a morningstar rating tm is based on a riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance including the effects of sales charges loads and
