encounters which she discovers to her horror is her son isaac the seriesedit season edit a woman shows up in the present day coming out of a cab in the finale of season  bearing a striking resemblance to suzanna  season edit aidan catches a glimpse of suzanna at kats faculty mixer but when he goes outside to look for her she is nowhere to be found aidan continues to have visions and dreams about his longlost wife until she appears to him on his doorstep it is then that aidan discovers suzanna is a vampire as she is unable to enter the house aidan and suzanna try to catch up with one another with aidan asking her questions about her life over the last  years though suzanna seems reluctant to tell him much though she lies to him that isaac lived a long and happy life and died a grandfather a few days later aidan goes to visit suzanna in her hotel room ironically the hotel aidan frequently visited in season  he asks to come in though it seems to take suzanna a moment to process what hes asked she welcomes aidan in though when she turns to close the door behind him shes seen to be holding a colonial time stake shaped like a cross her expression reveals she was expecting someone else besides aidan they move into the living quarters and almost immediately aidan begins to ask her questions of the past and why she never tried to start a life with him suzanna hesitates then tells aidan that bishop would have rather had a son over a daughter and didnt think her worthy of aidan and she also couldnt believe it when she heard that bishop was dead not until she found out aidan killed him at that note aidan continued to question suzanna about her past but she only told him that the past should stay in the past later that night suzanna has just taken a shower and she is walking back toward the bed with a look of dread on her face we then see her take off her robe and a flashback begins to take place we go back to the days after she was turned into a vampire and is roaming the forest she is only stopped when a small boy runs past her the smell of his blood forcing her to the ground at this point suzanna could die at any time from lack of blood and begins to hallucinate of aidan he tells her to feed just his one time for her resulting in her using her vampire speed to run after the small boy we then are taken back to the present where we see a saddened suzanna pull a whip from over her bed it seems that in grief of this certain memory each night she whips herself then we are taken back to the past where a young suzanna takes down the small boy and drains him of his blood though it turns out the boy was her own son isaac she is then horrified and shocked that she just killed her own son once again we are taken back to the future where suzanna continues to whip herself it is then when bishop shows up to see suzanna holding to dead body of her son suzanna begs bishop to turn isaac but he refuses saying he couldnt curse a child to damnation so in turn she begs him to kill her and he again refuses telling suzanna after this life they dont get another chance it is assumed she then buries the body of her dead son while kenny and aidan are gone from one of the new vampire blood dens suzanna gets into the club where she stakes all the vampires inside  suzanna is then confronted by aiden who asks why she is really in boston she then reveals that she has been killing vampires before they kill humans when aiden asked how she can be surviving since she claims suzanna told my aiden to leave boston she doesnt drink live blood she says that she drinks a bare minimal amount once in a great while and as such she has become a powerful vampire aiden then says that she needs to leave town before kenny discovers her while leading her away from the hotel aiden asks suzanna what to do suzanna tells aiden to leave kat about kat suzanna then says that it is best he break up with her as revealing she had experienced this a humanvampire relationship wont work before leaving some time after believing she left suzanna enocunters aiden at an ally and suzanna sees aiden struggling learns that he was going to a blood den however suzanna reveals that she doesnt trust them and that they were bad places while aiden is becoming blood thirsty she takes him to the bar she works at and suzanna and aiden at the bar gives him the same amount of blood she drinks causing aiden to be disgusted as it was b blood it was during this time that aiden witnessed suzanna compelling two people at once something not even bishop achieved the two then have sex on the counter suzanna telling him that she wouldnt give him anymore blood if she had any the two then argue as aiden comments that it is unfair of her to kill vampires since they dont get an afterlife suzanna argues that she doesnt kill every vampire just the ones that completely drain a living person of their blood she then tells aiden that she is willing to believe he can change as long as he doesnt kill a human otherwise she will kill him  this leads to a sort of contest between the excouple if aiden can go without killing a person for blood she wont kill him however if suzanna can go without killing vampires he wont kill her the two unfortunately both end up slipping aiden killing a woman who bares a close resemblance to rebecca her name being amy and suzanna killing a passing vampire after aiden kills amy suzanna poisons him to drain him of any blood he drank and chains him to her sink in her hotel room to interrogate him she tells aiden that amy is dead and her death was on him when aiden suzanna poisons aiden reveals many different names of the people he killed within one day suzanna tells him that if he wants to make a game out of this she had nothing but time  after aiden breaks down suzanna unchains him and reveals that the only suzanna reveals that she killed isaac person she killed her first and last kill was their son isaac while aiden picks up her stake and prepares to kill her he doesnt and instead hugs her after suzanna reveals that she knows who the leader of boston is she tells aiden that to earn her forgiveness she needs to kill him she then gives him her stake which was made out of a cross she later reveals that she went to the church the one they both went to when she was alive after she had killed isaac to pray for forgiveness and that isaac would forgive her as well it was here that she stole the cross and fashioned it into a stake in the attempt to kill herself however she lost her nerve and was unable to when suzanna telling aiden to kill kenny aiden refuses he reveals that kenny is his son aiden not knowing that suzanna was well aware of that she lies to him by saying he has two months to change him before going to kill him herself  upon arriving at sap n sons by hiding in a body bag suzanna kills all other vampires in the room possibly including blake before drugging kenny she then suzanna vs kenny uses his phone to send a message to aiden telling him to help him when aiden arrives she tells him to kill him after he refuses she drugs him as well  and forces him to hold the stake to kenny while telling him to kill suzanna vs kenny and aiden kenny aiden tells her over and over that it wasnt her fault she killed isaac and that it was bishops while aiden tries to assure her to stop that killing isaac wasnt her fault she tells him to stop saying that revealing that in over  years she has been unable to forgive herself aiden then stabs her suzanna killed by aiden with the stake telling her that she will be able to forgive herself now and that he hopes she finds peace abilitiesedit as a vampire suzanna possessed all the basic abilities of a vampire however her strongest skill appeared to be her ability to compel others being able to compel two teenagers at once and to give them very specific and complex orders none of which failed she also has been shown to resist kennys compelling ability with it having no effect whatsoever due to her feeding on juniper giving her an immunity or tolerance to the plant she is also able to survive on very little blood and go long spans of time without it without losing any strength or feeling fatigued while she tried teaching this to aiden she was unsuccessful in the attempt suzanna has also been shown to be quite a fighter as she was able to overpower aiden easily though the latter was already exhausted from fighting werewolves and has killed multiple vampires single handedly at once she has also been killing vampires most of her life showing that her fighting skills grew she also set a trap on a vampire so that if they were touched the vampire would die through unknown means suzanna has also managed to find clean blood since the virus wiped out
