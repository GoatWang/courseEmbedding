facto uniform just look around at the mall and its nothing but a sea of blue denim yuk no imagination wranchers come in a bunch of colors that i like and they never fade btw wrangler more colors is always better and how bout a few patterns too ever look at faded black jeans just nasty my black wranchers are the same color as when i bought them i think the pressed crease is sweet toofor younger guys like me buy them a little shorter than your normal size and the crease will stay straight they fit nice and slim  the way jeans are meant to fit wear them with fun shoes like skaters or cons
