crowdfundingpeerstreetrealtyshares reviewaverage rating  reviewssummaryrealtyshares has some strong points including adequate capital support from savvy backers a userfriendly website and some good press investors also like its low minimums  for your first deal generally  thereafter and hold periods as short as six months it is also trying some innovative things such as accepting bitcoin and providing marketspecific products aimed at its core investor base among it professionals in five cities but the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators the site does have some funds and multifamilycommercial projects but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the re crowdfunding universe investors who like the deals it offers will find realtyshares a likeable and easy to navigate platform but it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved background founded in q  by ceo nav athwal realtyshares has received  million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including  million in a series a funding in april  its backers include well known venture capitalists menlo ventures general catalyst partners and  startups menlo ventures’ managing director john jarve who sits on the board of hot automated investing service betterment is on the realtyshares board realtyshares has been compared to a lending club for real estate offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects it funds about  to  projects a month the inspiration for athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on realtyshares after the financial crisis of  traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access open a realtyshares accountquick factsminimum investment assets under management unknownyear founded number of users realtyshares fees management fees for investorsexpert walkthrough pros low minimum of  for first investment otherwise usually  focus on deals with short lifecycles cons deal quality is not high weighted to single family home flip market only for accredited investors high fees bottom line realtyshares is a smaller player in the realestate crowdfunding arena it has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments but its deal flow includes many single family home flips which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms its fees are considered higher than average too philosophy realtyshares’ founder athwal says that realtyshares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served especially small real estate developers and house flippers the process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the  economic crisis they often will not lend to individuals without w income crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns in one case covered by cnbc chicago house flipper ben walhood said he can get full funding from realtyshares in as little as an hour investors in his deals would earn around  vs loans around  if backed by fannie mae and freddie mac in traditional financing realtyshares is “able to provide quicker more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards banks just aren’t meeting that need” athwal said typical projects and geography at the time of our test there were five live deals on the site including a fund two single family flips and two apartment buildings three were in california and the others in new york and florida realtyshares has done transactions in  states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from florida california illinois and texas the deals we saw ranged in size from  to  million for the realtyshares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions minimum investment ranged from  to  and hold terms from eight months to five years realtyshares says it welcomes cashflowingvalue add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investment in fix and flips in high demandlow supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate target demographic realtyshares is only open to accredited investors meaning those with net worth of  million or income of  a year the platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the  million to  million range and all types of cashflowing residential and commercial projects realtyshares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model realtyshares said in  that  to  of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate interest in innovation athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities it is creating marketspecific products to enable developers in seattle dallas austin miami and chicago to raise funding from local investors realtyshares’ interest in innovation led it in  to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment the platform says this is a more costeffective and streamlined way for investors to send money especially if they are abroad because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers website popularity as of june  realtyshares has an estimated  monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about  minute on the site with  page views about  of the traffic is from the united states as of midmay  realtyshares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the united states leadership team realtyshares’ founder athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer he worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing california and national developers and reits in the san francisco bay area he doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid the management team is rounded out by eight specialists with handson experience in operations transactions engineering and other disciplines again they have strong resumes but not high name recognition realtyshares’ leadership earned a b grade in one review what do the experts think realtyshares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as  startups so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform but it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin blogger mark robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on realtyshares while he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays he said they have met or beat expectations summary realtyshares looks like a solid platform with longterm potential while its low minimum investments are attractive it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees it is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals especially fix and flip single family home projects it’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors deal structure investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or secondposition loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of  annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period andor a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property how does realtyshares screen investments realtyshares reviews the sponsors first looking for companies with experience it says it runs background and credit checks then it reviews proposed transactions including financials geography property type and quality and investment structure “while each investment includes risk and realtyshares cannot guarantee results our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform” it says “once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity and if so how much” so like other crowdfunded real estate sites it’s up to you to do your due diligence underwritingdeal flow ceo athwal said that as of spring  realtyshares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about  in  properties that are offered to it “i think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property” he said however the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips these are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lowerquality deals than bigger budget projects fees realtyshares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications but the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement the ones we viewed were plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher as best we could tell the ongoing fees to realtyshares as manager of the transaction llc amounted to  a year realtyshares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals this article says realtyshares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of  percent to  percent it also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment including providing investors with tax documents and distributions through the platform a realtyshares presentation for a funding round in february  showed it earning fees of  that is comparatively high among re crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment ease of use realtyshares has a more involved signup process than other platforms we have test driven while some sites initially ask only for an email address and password realtyshares seeks your phone number address employer amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you if you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment that might make you leery but it also suggests realtyshares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests so it could be a plus for some it offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with  return  month hold unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals after signing up you see a countdown clock on the day cooling off period you are also directed to a helpful eightminute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it we liked this feature a lot listings the page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow there’s a deal dashboard and tabs allow you to view an overview financials documents photos background on management and faqs one closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project which provided a wealth of information what am i buying on realtyshares realtyshares explains what you are actually buying this way realtyshares sets up a separate limited liability company llc for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform that llc in turn will make a loan on a real estate property in the case of a debt investment or hold equity in an llc or lp that in turn owns real estate property in the case of an equity investment when you invest through realtyshares you own shares in that llc using this structure you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level if you invest in a debt deal the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account if you invest in an equity investment opportunity usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents andor a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold as with debt investments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account how safe is my money as we’ve said before real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices and that holds even truer for realtyshares experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals real estate by its nature can be a risky investment and realtyshares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals while offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum realtyshares could do a much better job of making its site transparent it says it is currently affiliated with wealthforge a registered brokerdealer with finra and member of sipc both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors and that wealthforge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to realtyshares but it’s unclear if sipc protections apply to realtyshares investments even if they do they do not protect against loss in value liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors they would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer in truth it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate open a realtyshares accountrealtyshares reviews investorjunkie  there are various pluses and minuses with the service but realtyshares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors crowdfunding generally democratizes investing making it available to even the smallest investors the accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals we’ll give realtyshares a rating of  out of  stars with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative crowdfunding website reviews we have singled out realtyshares for the purpose of our first real estate crowdfunding site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye not the least of which is their forwardthinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using bitcoin we love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments this move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing the tech crowd open a realtyshares account realtyshares reviews  is it a scam or legit for business log in contact us search realtyshares reviews  reviews write a review category business review topic crowdfunding investing real estate website wwwrealtysharescom about realtyshares founded by nav athwal realtyshares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in prescreened and professionally managed residential commercial retail and mixeduse projects not only does realtyshares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments how does realtyshares claim to work by now you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like kickstarter indiegogo gofundme and boostercom which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs using these websites all you have to do is list your project and if other people are interested in helping you out they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with recently though a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like realtyshares which claims to serve two primary purposes  to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects and  help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders since coming online in late  realtyshares has garnered quite a lot of media attention having been featured on the wall street journal forbes cnn money business times and more due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently in short realtyshares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects and according to the company they give you the ability to make real estate investments in  simple steps sign up for a realtyshares account browse investments securely if you find one you’re interested in you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering including “financials property information legal and financial documents and investment manager bios” finalize your investment directly through the realtyshares website the company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using docusign and funds can be transferred via balanced next each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share while you’re waiting for this to occur your money will be held in an fdic insured escrow account and if this goal isn’t reached then  of your money will be refunded all realtyshares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents you’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email and tax documents are provided once per year you’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time or are just a passing fad after all you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hardearned money but is realtyshares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions consider the following you have options when it comes to real estate investing first and foremost if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website keep in mind that realtyshares isn’t your only option as other sites such as fundrise realty mogul crowdstreet collaperty and many more are vying for your business with this said according to realtyshares’ ceo the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees complete transparency a seamless investment process and access to a wider range of investment opportunities how much risk are you willing to take on next like any other type of investment real estate projects come with a certain level of risk so you’re not guaranteed to make any money in fact in a worstcase scenario you could end up losing your entire investment also remember that real estate investments are not liquid which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time as such you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it realtyshares’ investor guidelines if you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on realtyshares the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an accredited investor according to the realtyshares faq this means you must be “a natural person with  a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding  million not including the value of the primary residence and  or  annual income of  in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding  for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year” on top of this you must have a minimum of  to contribute to a project although some investments may go as low as  there is no maximum investment amount and you can even qualify as a foreign investor realtyshares’ investment options if you qualify as an investor you’ll have two options debt investment and equity investment debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project and depending on your level of investment your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account on the other hand an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis or on the profits if the project is sold regardless of the type each investment will come with its own ‘hold period” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold this information will be available on the project’s investment overview page and can last anywhere from less than  months to more than  years realtyshares’ company guidelines according to the company’s website realtyshares only provides loans eg debt investments for  unit residential properties and some commercial properties such as apartment buildings specifically the website’s faq states projects must be cashflowingvalueadd equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investments in fix  flips located in high demandlow supply markets loans secured by residential and commercial real estate on top of this borrowers must have a minimum  credit score a loan to purchase price of less than  and an “estimated loan to after repair value once the property is rehabbed less than ” as such the realtyshares will not work for construction or groundup development projects on top of this realtyshares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed including background and credit checks comps projected returns geography property type and quality investment structure a knowledgeable team and a proven track record although realtyshares doesn’t guarantee successful funding the company claims that most projects listed are funded within  days however for any projects listed on realtyshares companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with regulation d rule b finally realtyshares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors since all funds are pooled into a single llc the difference between realtyshares  reits when compared to reits real estate investment trusts realtyshares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in whereas reits traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography in addition realtyshares claims to charge substantially lower fees than reits we’ll talk more about this in a moment what are other investors saying about realtyshares realtyshares inc has only been in business since late  and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research however most professional reviews from large websites such as forbes and techcrunch seem to be favorable not just for realtyshares but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general realtyshares pricing realtyshares is free to sign up for an account whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding however according to the company’s faq they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment” although the specific fee for each investment can vary and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement after a project has been funded the money is pooled and moved into an individual llc which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment as such you will be a shareholder in this llc compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites realtyshares accepts bitcoin for investments either through coinbase or your bitcoin address although distributions will be paid in us dollars in order to ask questions about fees payments or anything else you can contact realtyshares’ customer service department at  can realtyshares help you wisely diversify your investment portfolio chopping to the point considering the fact that realtyshares has received a fair amount of positive media attention that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company they appear to be a solid

in deep red triwest who sponsored  blairwood dr   chalon rd investment and paragon who sponsored  gilbert road have stopped making payments they have given lame excuses for delays they are running a ponzi scheme to dupe investors and realtyshares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors dont get caught in this poor dealings bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend help others find the most helpful reviews was this review helpful yes no comments  view all  commentshide comments may   ted triwest certainly has been a disaster fortunately they managed to sell the property i had investments in and made some money but nothing like their claimed return even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate i agree that realtyshares does minimal due diligence what is shocking is you cant get access to the agreement with the sponsor only the realtyshares llc you are investing in so the real terms and conditions arent available they are also easy to dupe they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered realtyshares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities a strong buyer beware not only does realityshares do little to no due diligence but they make it impossible for you to do so either go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at realityshares and they wont answer i went back to making my own hard money loans so i have access to the property the borrower and can track things closely do you have an account log in before commenting if you don’t have an account –

seems natural to approach with caution since most people dont have much experience with this specific concept my experience has been very positive realtyshares has been very professional and responsible any real estate project has risks by default but i have had no issues after making more than  investments using the realtyshares platform realtyshares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors because of that projects that might include underfunded developers crackpots slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform the returnrisk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered i would  and have  recommended realtyshares to good friends bottom line

is helping real estate investors close learn more register december     pm why crowdfunding is a potential boon for real estate investors written by mark spera crowdfunding platforms typically offer a range of investment opportunities at realtyshares investors have the ability to choose between debt and equity investments involving both residential and commercial property types that’s an important benefit for investors who want to diversify their portfolio by adding in real estate holdings but may be concerned about spreading out risk because real estate crowdfunding platforms require much lower minimum investments than traditional private real estate deals it’s possible for investors to pick and choose where they want to put their money instead of sinking  into a single property investors can break the money up into  or  different investments if one underperforms it’s less likely to drag down their entire portfolio founder and ceo athwal says that investments on the platform have paid back over  million in capital so far q saw  million of investment activity on the platform were not allowed to share specific returns because of sec regulations but there are some homes and commercial properties you can investigate further by signing up here  read to the bottom theres a way to make  courtesy of my sponsor check out wwwrealtysharescom realtyshares offers investors  million reasons to consider real estate crowdfunding investing in real estate is no longer an exclusive club like rewardsbased or loan crowdfunding real estate crowdfunding operates based on the premise of pooled funds multiple investors can hold equity stakes in a particular property or invest in the property’s mortgage note with each of them sharing in the investment returns this reflects the types of investment options available through platforms like realtyshares though still in its infancy real estate crowdfunding has had a significant impact on real estate as a whole from an investor perspective this alternative path offers a number of potential advantages over the traditional real estate investing model investing in real estate can be a rewarding venture but traditionally access to private deals has been limited to a select few specifically investing in highlevel properties meant having the right connections and a largeenough bankroll to get in on the ground floor fortunately the crowdfunding industry has eliminated some of the barriers that once prevented certain investors from gaining entry to the real estate marketinstead of needing  or  to participate in a private real estate investment it’s now possible to start at a lower price point with realtyshares for example accredited investors can gain access to deals with as little as  the fact that it costs nothing to sign up for an account and browse available deals only adds to the appeal funded deal on realtysharescom  realtyshares founder and ceo nav athwal nothing can replace great diversification but crowdfunding platforms like realtyshares can help take care of the real estate portion of your portfolio registration is free its worth a look plus if you register today link a bank account and use my code markspera they will transfer you  just for signing up real estate crowdfunding offers investors potentially more variety  looking to explore real estate investments

irreparable injury requirement  moreover trial testimony by representatives of both parties established that in addition to lost sales false advertising also inflicts substantial harm on a

 at  ed va july    thus while mead johnson is correct that it appears the jury awarded pbm some future damages the court disagrees with mead johnson’s  conclusion that an award of future damages indicates that monetary damages are an adequate and sufficient award in this case  the monetary judgment against mead johnson compensates pbm for harm that flowed from the mailer an injunction properly prevents mead johnson from infecting the marketplace with the same or similar claims in different advertisements in the future  mead johnson asserts though that the mailer is no longer in circulation and it has not made any indication that it will continue to make those claims in future advertisements  it is that uncertainty however that makes an injunction all the more appropriate as preventing the necessity of multiple suits is a classic justification for finding

third when faced with the question of whether an injunction should be entered at all an evaluation of the resulting hardships favors pbm  mead johnson simply has no equitable

 sdny   accordingly the court finds that the ebay factors each weigh in favor of pbm and therefore an injunction is appropriate in this case the parties also disagree over the scope of any available injunctive relief  mead johnson claims that because the general verdict entered by the jury did not specify which of the four statements in the mailer the jury found false or misleading the injunction must be limited to the entire mailer or “other advertisements not colorably different from the mailer”   pbm responds by claiming that the court should enjoin the two express as well as the two implied claims in the mailer because such a ruling would be supported by the record and not inconsistent with the jury’s general verdict b scope of an injunction  rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that an injunction “state its

make factual findings to support equitable relief so long as those findings are not inconsistent with factual findings essential to the jury’s verdict  fed r civ p c ohio sealy mattress mfg co v sealy inc  fd   th cir  based on the parties’ arguments and a review of the pleadings and trial transcripts the court will enjoin mead johnson from distributing the mailer or any advertisement not colorably different from the mailer  although pbm would like the court to specifically enjoin the implied claims the court finds that an injunction applicable to the mailer or anything similar sufficiently encompasses the implied claims made in the mailer as was done in the original injunction the court will also specifically enjoin the two express claims made in the mailer  mead johnson is correct that the general verdict did not specify if the jury concluded that the express claims that  store bought brands represent a cut back on nutrition and  only enfamil is clinically proven to improve brain and eye development in infants are false or misleading  but the court now concludes that the record supports an injunction including the express claims and that such an injunction would not be inconsistent with the jury’s verdict   of the two express claims in the mailer mead johnson only seriously disputes the injunction applying to the “only enfamil is clinically proven” claim  in its view neither the record nor the jury verdict supports a finding that this claim is false or misleading  the court disagrees  to make its claim that only enfamil has been clinically proven to promote infant development mead johnson primarily relied on a group of government funded clinical studies which the parties refer to as the “birch studies” sonamed after one of the studies’ authors  mead johnson’s reliance is however not justified for several reasons  although mead johnson’s formula supplemented with dha and ara was the formula used in the birch studies trial testimony established that the studies’ conclusion that dha and ara promote infant development is not limited to mead johnson’s formula but to any infant formula that makes the same or similar amounts of dha and ara bioavailable to an infant  this conclusion is drawn from testimony elicited from pbm as well as mead johnson witnesses  pbm’s dr petersen testified that the benefits shown in the birch studies were not limited to the exact formula matrix used in the studies  trial tr vol i  nov    mead johnson’s brenna and tucker agreed trial tr vol iv  nov   brenna trial tr vol iii  nov   tucker  to claim otherwise would have placed mead johnson’s own ability to rely on the birch studies in peril  the manufacturing specifications for mead johnson’s formula actually allow mead johnson to vary the ratio of dha and ara and still claim that it is enfamil lipil  trial tr  brenna trial exh   moreover since the birch studies mead johnson’s formula has undergone at least  changes  trial tr  to the extent mead johnson does dispute the injunction applying to the second literal claim that store brands are a cutback on nutrition the same evidence cited below that supports enjoining the “only enfamil is clinically proven” claim also supports enjoining the “cutback on nutrition” claim   petersen   tucker  thus mead johnson must necessarily agree that small differences in the ratio of dha and ara will not diminish the benefits of those nutrients  instead trial testimony reasonably supports the conclusion that the issue is whether a sufficient amount of dha and ara in the formula is bioavailable to an infant  trial tr  petersen  brenna  and indeed mead johnson’s dr brenna and pbm’s dr petersen agreed that pbm’s quintiles study established that the amount of dha and ara in pbm’s formula—an amount actually slightly higher than in enfamil—is bioavailable to infants  trial tr   petersen   brenna  thus the court finds that the “only clinically proven” claim is misleading that such a conclusion is consistent with the record and the jury’s verdict and that therefore the claim will be enjoined the parties have also raised several other issues that need to be briefly addressed  first mead johnson suggests that an evidentiary hearing is required to resolve all of the issues raised by a request for injunctive relief   neither the law nor the current posture of this case support that request  the court has held a sevenday jury trial and the parties have submitted a mound of posttrial motions during which each side has had a full and fair opportunity to apprise the court of the law and evidence  contrary to mead johnson’s claims an injunction including the express claims does not expand the issues in this case or affect how the case would have been negotiated or litigated in any manner that substantially prejudices mead johnson  see robinson v lorillard corp  fd   th cir   an additional hearing is simply unnecessary  see lone star steakhouse  saloon inc v alpha of va inc  fd   th cir   next mead johnson objected to the original injunction applying to all false claims made in connection with pbm asserting that such language is overly broad and difficult to enforce  at oral argument on the injunction pbm agreed that this language need not be in the permanent injunction  the court will oblige the parties on this issue the original injunction also included a requirement that mead johnson retrieve the offending mailer from the “public forum”  pbm and mead johnson agree that the mailer was sent to consumers’ homes and thus such a requirement would be futile  pbm however requests that the injunction apply to the four claims made in the mailer and that the retrieval requirement apply to any advertising or promotional material containing those claims  pbm adds that if retrieval is not possible a sticker should be placed over the offending portions of any label  mead johnson has stated the mailer is no longer distributed and that it is not making three of the claims in the mailer at all however it has continued to make the “only enfamil lipil is clinically proven” claim  mead johnson via an affidavit also notes that this claim is on all of its labels and that retrieving them would cost millions of dollars and would disrupt the entire supply of infant formula in the united states  placing a sticker mead johnson states would also cost millions of dollars  a retrieval or stickering requirement would significantly alter the balance of the hardships and thus the court declines to impose those conditions on mead johnson  the injunction does apply however to all advertising or promotional material or statements going forward lastly pbm wants the court to require mead johnson to send corrective advertising to all individuals in mead johnson’s enfamil family beginnings database stating that the four claims stated in the mailer are false or misleading   although the court acknowledges the  reputational harm that false messages can inflict pbm is not entitled to an order requiring mead johnson to issue corrective advertising because it did not seek that remedy in its complaint and has not done any prospective corrective advertising of its own suggesting that the desire for this remedy arose only after it obtained a favorable verdict  see robinson  fd at   moreover the jury’s award included damages for future harm from the mailer which encompasses the effect the mailer had on those that received it  thus the request for corrective advertising is denied for the foregoing reasons the parties’ motions are resolved as follows  mead johnson’s motion to vacate the order granting the injunction to stay the injunction pending resolution of the motions to vacate or amend the injunction and to set a schedule
