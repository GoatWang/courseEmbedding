doubt about it mahon said in an interview thursday allen loney carried out the role during the most difficult financial crisis canada has faced for a long time and i have been there beside him i have seen him provide the company with a strong and stable footing allen has brought us into a growth trajectory we are in great shapespeaking at his last annual meeting and analyst conference call as ceo loney was clearly pleased that the company is in better shape nowthe only slight complaint i have loney joked is that no one warned me that my term as ceo would exactly coincide with the worst

years in london ont after greatwest lifes acquisition of london lifeat the beginning of my career i couldnt have imagined this mahon said as wellwishers congratulated him at a reception after the agm but i would say i have seen the outstanding leadership of people like ray mcfeetors and allen loney and you can only be inspired by the work they have done and the impact they have had on the company and i want to contribute in the same wayhe said it would be presumptuous of him to talk about putting his own stamp on the company so soon after assuming the corner officethe company has  million in cash and although it hasnt even started digesting the irish life acquisition mahon said it is always on the lookout for purchaseswe are always looking to grow from an organic perspective which means being more competitive with our products and services in any market winning more clients one at a time and we are always looking for opportunities for acquisitions whenever it makes sense where we can
