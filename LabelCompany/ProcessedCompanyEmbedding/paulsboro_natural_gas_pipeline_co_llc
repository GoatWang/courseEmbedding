fingertips it provides you with multiple options for a more powerful and efficient search experience importantly though by choosing to use advanced terms you render the dropdown filters in the advanced search null hence you only can use advanced terms or use the preset filters and keywords but you cannot use both in the same search about modifiers and boolean search connectors using the term modifiers below you will be able to construct a rich query to find results for your search first some important background a query is broken up into terms and operators there are two types of terms single terms and phrases a single term is a single word such as test or hello a phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as hello dolly multiple terms can be combined together with boolean operators to form a more complex query each term can be further revised by a term modifier wildcard searches you can perform a wildcard search within a single term but not within a phrase the single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced for example to search for text or test you can use the search tet multiple character wildcard searches looks for zero or more characters for example to search for test tests or tester you can use the search test you can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term tet note however that you cannot use a  or  symbol as the first character of a search fuzzy searches fuzzy searches help find words that sound the same but are spelled differently such as roam and rome words that have alternative spellingslabor and labour those that are misspelled and those that include a base word but include prefixes andor suffixes search results for the word plan will include preplan and planning to do a fuzzy search use the tilde symbol  at the end of a singleword term for example to search for a term similar in spelling to roam use the fuzzy search roam proximity searches you can find words that are within a specific distance away from one another to perform a proximity search use the tilde symbol  followed by the number of words that can separate your search words for example federal corporation will find federal deposit insurance corporation term boosting if there is a term in your search query of particular importance you can increase its relevance to the query using the carat operator  if you want to indicate that the word treasury is more important in your search use the query treasury guidance the higher the boost factor the more relevant that term will be in your result set boolean operators of course the search query also supports the standard set of boolean operators to specify how your search terms should be combined the default operator is or so if there is no operator specified the query engine assumes an or the or operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document the and operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document the not operator excludes documents that contain the term after not it cannot be used with just one term specified in the search the near operator links terms and finds a matching document if the terms are located within five words grouping we support using parentheses to group clauses to form subqueries this can be useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query federal and guidance or regulation hide add a search term or and not near topic content type other government documents news my resources search by

ferc ¶  united states of america federal energy regulatory commission before commissioners  norman c bay chairman cheryl a lafleur tony clark and colette d honorable paulsboro natural gas pipeline company llc docket no cp order issuing certificate and granting abandonment issued september    on december   paulsboro natural gas pipeline company llc paulsboro filed an application pursuant to sections b and c of the natural gas act nga and part  of the commission’s regulations requesting authorization to relocate an approximately milelong  and inchdiameter natural gas pipeline located between delaware county pennsylvania and gloucester county new jersey delaware river pipeline relocation project  as discussed below the commission will grant the requested authorization subject to certain conditions i background and proposal  paulsboro a delaware limited liability company is a natural gas company as defined by section  of the nga  paulsboro is a subsidiary of pbf holding company llc pbf holding which is a subsidiary of pbf energy company llc pbf energy co  the pipeline was originally constructed by mobil oil corporation mobil oil in  as part of a milelong pipeline to deliver refined petroleum products from its refinery in paulsboro new jersey to a delivery terminal in philadelphia pennsylvania  the fuel oil pipeline was later decommissioned in   in  the commission issued paulsboro’s predecessor mobil natural gas pipeline co mobil natural gas a certificate to  convert a portion of the pipeline from refined petroleum products service to natural gas service  construct and operate certain appurtenant and interconnection facilities and  to transport natural gas exclusively for mobil oil  the  order allowed mobil natural gas to operate on a proprietary basis and did not require mobil natural gas to provide open access transportation services  specifically the commission waived the provisions of part  of the regulations that require the filing of a gas tariff because “mobil natural gas will serve only mobil oil and does not propose to charge mobil oil a transportation rate”  paulsboro’s pipeline is approximately  miles long originates in delaware county pennsylvania at an interconnection with texas eastern transmission lp texas eastern northwest of the philadelphia international airport philadelphia airport runs under the delaware river and terminates at the delivery point to the paulsboro refinery in gloucester county new jersey  the pipeline is currently capable of transporting the equivalent of approximately  dekatherms per day dthday  the delivery point to the refinery is adjacent to the delaware river   paulsboro proposes the delaware river pipeline relocation project to comply with a directive from the us army corps of engineers usace to remove a portion of the existing pipe from the delaware river  the existing pipeline is within the navigation channel which is currently being deepened from  feet to  feet as part of the usace’s delaware river main channel deepening project delaware river foot project  on august   a usace contractor struck and damaged the pipeline during dredging activities  paulsboro repaired the damaged pipeline pursuant to its emergency blanket authority and resumed service  on october   usace informed paulsboro that the deadline to remove and relocate the pipeline is june    paulsboro proposes to abandon  feet of and inchdiameter pipeline including the segment within the navigation channel  paulsboro will abandon by removal approximately  feet of the pipeline which includes approximately  feet of inchdiameter pipeline within the delaware river navigation channel straddling pennsylvania and new jersey and approximately  feet of inchdiameter pipeline within the philadelphia airport property in delaware county pennsylvania  paulsboro will abandon in place approximately  feet of the existing pipeline mainly located on the philadelphia airport and on property owned by the consolidated rail corporation conrail and by the city of philadelphia as well as in certain portions of the delaware river outside of the navigation channel  to replace the abandoned pipeline paulsboro proposes to install approximately  feet of inchdiameter pipeline originating at the interconnection with texas eastern and approximately  feet of inchdiameter pipeline from the entry point to paulsboro new jersey to the tiein with the refinery facilities  the increased pipe size will enable paulsboro to provide up to  dthday of service to the refinery  in addition paulsboro proposes to install a new pig launcher at the texas eastern meter station on the pennsylvania side of the pipeline and to construct a new aboveground paulsboro refinery tiein which will include a new pig receiver block valves and a reducer  paulsboro also requests waivers of certain filing reporting and other regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to an interstate pipeline owner and operator and a part  subpart f blanket construction certificate to perform certain routine activities ii public notice interventions and comments  notice of paulsboro’s application was issued on december   and published in the federal register on december    the notice established january   as the deadline for filing comments and interventions  pseg energy resources  trade llc and conrail filed timely unopposed motions to intervene which were granted by operation of rule c of the commission’s rules of practice and procedure  in its intervention conrail raised concerns that paulsboro had not contacted it to discuss safety related issues or to request a right of access to the conrail rightofway  conrail also requested that the commission condition approval of the application upon paulsboro’s adherence to conrail’s safety requirements and that paulsboro indemnify conrail of any environmental remediation obligations arising out of construction disturbances  on january   paulsboro filed a response to conrail’s comments stating that it intended to cooperate with conrail  on july   conrail filed a letter stating that it has been negotiating with paulsboro on the use of conrail’s rightofway and was hopeful that an agreement would be reached  delaware riverkeeper network filed comments about environmental and safety matters including impacts on ecosystems habits water quality and the need for an environmental impact statement eis  these comments are addressed in the environmental assessment ea and as appropriate in the environmental section of this order iii discussion  since the facilities paulsboro seeks to abandon have been used to transport natural gas in interstate commerce subject to the commission’s jurisdiction and the proposed replacement facilities will be used for jurisdictional service the proposed abandonment construction and operation of the facilities are subject to the requirements of subsections b c and e of section  of the nga a abandonment  section b of the nga allows an interstate pipeline company to abandon jurisdictional facilities only if the abandonment is permitted by the present or future public convenience or necessity  the applicant has the burden of providing evidence to show that the abandonment is permitted under this standard  the commission has stated that continuity and stability of existing service are the primary considerations in assessing the public convenience or necessity of a permanent cessation of service under nga section b  paulsboro requests authorization to abandon by removal and in place approximately  miles of pipeline extending from its interconnection with texas eastern to its tiein with the paulsboro refinery including pipeline located within the delaware river  paulsboro states that the delaware river relocation project will accommodate usace’s delaware river foot project safeguard the continued operation of its pipeline facilities ensure continuation of existing service to the paulsboro refinery and accommodate potential future commercial operations at the refinery  because the facilities to be abandoned will be replaced by the facilities discussed below the proposed abandonment will not adversely impact the existing customer the paulsboro refinery   based on the above we find that the proposed abandonment is permitted by the public convenience and necessity  therefore we will approve the abandonment b replacement pipeline  certificate policy statement  the commission’s certificate policy statement provides guidance for evaluating proposals to certificate new pipeline construction  the certificate policy statement establishes criteria for determining whether there is a need for a proposed project and whether the proposed project will serve the public interest  the certificate policy statement explains that in deciding whether to authorize the construction of major new pipeline facilities the commission balances the public benefits against the potential adverse consequences  the commission’s goal is to give appropriate consideration to the enhancement of competitive transportation alternatives the possibility of overbuilding subsidization by existing customers the applicant’s responsibility for unsubscribed capacity the avoidance of unnecessary disruptions of the environment and the unneeded exercise of eminent domain in evaluating new pipeline construction  under this policy the threshold requirement for existing pipelines proposing new projects is that the pipeline must be prepared to financially support the project without relying on subsidization from its existing customers  the next step is to determine whether the applicant has made efforts to eliminate or minimize any adverse effects the project might have on the applicant’s existing customers existing pipelines in the market and their captive customers or landowners and communities affected by the route of the new facilities  if residual adverse effects on these interest groups are identified after efforts have been made to minimize them the commission will evaluate the project by balancing the evidence of public benefits to be achieved against the residual adverse effects  this is essentially an economic test  only when the benefits outweigh the adverse effects on economic interests will the commission proceed to complete the environmental analysis where other interests are considered  as stated above the threshold requirement for pipelines proposing new projects is that the pipeline must be prepared to financially support the project without relying on subsidization from its existing customers  the pipeline was constructed as a proprietary line for use exclusively to deliver natural gas to the affiliated paulsboro refinery  paulsboro provides no service to thirdparty shippers and does not have a ferc tariff  therefore we find that the threshold nosubsidy requirement has been met  because the project is designed to maintain and augment existing service to the current customer we find the proposal will not degrade service to that customer and there will be no adverse impact on other pipelines or their captive customers  further no pipeline company or their captive customers has protested paulsboro’s application  we further find that paulsboro has taken steps to minimize any adverse impacts on landowners and communities that might be affected by the project  paulsboro refining conrail the philadelphia airport and dave henderson are the main property owners affected by the project  as discussed above conrail and paulsboro continue to negotiate and are optimistic that an agreement will be reached that will permit paulsboro to cross conrail’s property  paulsboro and mr henderson are continuing to negotiate easement agreements  the philadelphia airport and paulsboro are also working to revise existing easements and leases to address requirements for the existing pipeline on airport property  the proposed project will ensure continued transportation of natural gas supplies to the refinery and compliance with the usace directive and will shield the pipeline from further damage that could result from the delaware river foot project  based on the benefits that will result from the project with no adverse impacts on paulsboro’s existing customer and other pipelines and their captive customers and minimal impacts on landowners and surrounding communities we find that paulsboro’s proposal is consistent with the certificate policy statement and as conditioned in this order is required by the public convenience and necessity c blanket construction certificate  a part  blanket certificate gives an interstate pipeline authority automatically or after prior notice to construct acquire or abandon eligible pipeline facilities subject to the blanket certificate regulations’ costs limits and environmental conditions  because paulsboro is operating a jurisdictional pipeline facility for which this order grants certificate authorization we will also grant the requested part  subpart f blanket construction certificate authorizing paulsboro’s performance of certain routine activities in conjunction with its operation of the pipeline d rates and accounting  paulsboro requests continuation of a general waiver of the commission’s rate schedule and tariff filing requirements under part  of the commission’s regulations that would otherwise apply to its activities under the authority requested  paulsboro also requests waiver of a number of accounting and reporting requirements including those requirements under parts   including the uniform system of accounts  and  of the commission’s regulations  in addition paulsboro requests waiver of part  of the commission’s regulations which includes the requirement to file form nos  and a  although paulsboro asks for waiver from part  it acknowledges that recent commission precedent indicates that even if a pipeline receives waiver it must file pages  and  of form nos  or a with the commission   therefore paulsboro’s requested waiver excludes the annual filing of these pages and if applicable payments of the commission’s annual charges assessment in accordance with the commission’s regulations  paulsboro affirms that it does not intend to transport thirdparty gas  therefore consistent with previous certificates that were issued to companies with similar operations the commission finds the public interest would not be served by subjecting paulsboro to all of the regulatory requirements applicable to interstate natural gas pipeline companies  accordingly paulsboro’s request for waiver of the commission’s otherwise applicable regulatory requirements is granted as requested  however paulsboro is required to file page  and page  of form no a by april  of each year  moreover if paulsboro receives a bona fide request for thirdparty service the commission will reexamine these waivers  therefore this certificate is conditioned to require paulsboro to apply for blanket transportation authority under part  of the commission’s regulations within  days of paulsboro’s receipt of any bona fide request to provide service  in the event of a request for firm transportation service paulsboro must comply with the applicable part  reporting obligations and business practices e environmental analysis  on january   the commission issued a notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment for the proposed delaware river pipeline removal project and request for comments on environmental issues noi  the noi was mailed to interested parties including federal state and local officials agency representatives environmental and public interest groups native american tribes local libraries and newspapers and affected property owners  in response to the noi the commission received comments from three state agencies and one nongovernmental organization  the commission also received environmental comments with a filed intervention  the primary issues raised during the scoping process concerned cultural resources permitting requirements easement negotiations and the scope of the commission’s national environmental policy act nepa analysis  to satisfy the requirements of nepa our staff prepared an ea for paulsboro’s proposal that was placed in the public record on july

species land use recreation visual resources cultural resources air quality noise safety cumulative impacts and alternatives  no comments were received on the ea  based on the analysis in the ea we conclude that if constructed in accordance with paulsboro’s application and supplements and in compliance with the environmental conditions in the appendix to this order our approval of this proposal would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment  any state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions of this certificate  the commission encourages cooperation between interstate pipelines and local authorities  however this does not mean that state and local agencies through application of state or local laws may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by this commission  the commission on its own motion received and made a part of the record in this proceeding all evidence including the application as supplemented and exhibits thereto and all comments submitted herein and upon consideration of the

a letter based on some errant tax roll value we take the time and effort to make sure it is valued properly via your check stub detail production histories and reservoir characteristics which most of the time equates to a larger offer for you following are factors we consider when valuing your mineralsroyaltiesoverrides historical production performance reservoir characteristics commodity pricing concentration risk one well vs multiple wells like in a unit future drilling possibilities operator to determine the value of an interest we begin at looking at the specific reservoir since oil and gas are depleting resources every reservoir of petroleum has a decline rate feature anthem determines the decline rate of the reservoir and from that information we can determine how many months of reserves are probably left the number of months of reserves are indirectly proportionate to the steepness of the decline curve every reservoir has its own unique characteristics due to a vast array of reasons whether geological or even what gathering techniques the operator uses such as water or gas driven reserves once we have determined the volume and characteristics of the reserves we begin to value the interest value is then determined by current commodity price versus future pricing appropriate discount rate and how we want to ‘risk back’ value meaning the cost of capital versus some risk variable simply put reservoirs end up depleting meaning that all royalty checks eventually cease with time royalty owners are in essence selling part of their reserves each month that they receive a check our acquiring your interest is just a matter of adding all your future check amounts applying a fair discount rate to account for both interest and risk and offering you that amount upon your
