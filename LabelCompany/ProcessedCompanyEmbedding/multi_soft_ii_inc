comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with multi soft ii incs condensed financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein overview from june  through august   we were engaged in organizational efforts including obtaining initial financing and preparing to identify potential merger or acquisition candidates upon the effectiveness of our form  registration statement on august   we commenced our business operations our business purpose is to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on form  on august   we were solely engaged in organizational activities related to its corporate structure and causing its shares of common stock to become publicly tradable including the filing of the form  registration statement and had not yet engaged in identifying potential merger or acquisition candidates as of august   we commenced our investigation for potential merger or acquisition candidates and thus commenced our business operations and as of such date became a development stage entity in accordance with asc  all our results after august   have been reported as development stage operations our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry including both domestic and international companies we have negative working capital negative shareholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since  however we have issued an  revolving credit promissory note in favor of vector group ltd vector in the principal amount of up to  as amended on november   which we believe provides us with access to capital sufficient until we consummate a merger or other business combination we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations our historical operating results disclosed in this form q are not meaningful to our future results we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to i investigating and analyzing business combinations ii filing of exchange act reports and iii consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts as needed to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders management or other investors we may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business that may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company that does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering multi soft ii inc a development stage company our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders which is likely to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex in order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of multi solutions ii inc each of our officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us and multi solutions ii inc whereby they have each agreed that we will not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until multi solutions ii inc has agreed to consummate a business combination if we consummate a business combination we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the otc bulletin board the otcbb and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the otcbb subsequent to such business combination in addition subsequent to such business combination we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several nasdaq markets or the nyse mkt either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future however in  the nasdaq nyse and nyse mkt adopted a seasoning requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing sec filings during this time although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least  million we may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the  million exception which could adversely impact our ability to access us stock exchanges there can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the otcbb or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange or quotation service or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any of those or any other stock exchange or quotation service if an active trading market for our shares does not develop the value and liquidity of our shares will be materially and adversely affected multi soft ii inc a development stage company recent developments on november   we amended our credit facility in favor of vector from a principal amount of up to  to a principal amount of up to  and the outstanding balance owed to vector as of october   was  results of operations comparison of three months ended october   and  revenues we did not generate revenues for the three months ended october   and  respectively general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the three months ended october   and  were  and  respectively during the three months ended october   and

company liquidity and capital resources we do not have any revenues from operations and absent a merger or other combination with an operating company or a public or private sale of our equity or debt securities the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured we will be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from our present shareholders or management for which there is no existing commitment although we have no present commitment from any such parties to provide funding if we reach the point where we need funds to remain in operation we will attempt to raise funds from our present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt if in such situation we are unable to raise funds from those parties it is likely that our business would cease operations as of october   we had a cash balance of  total liabilities of  and a negative working capital balance of approximately  in april  we entered into an  revolving credit promissory note in favor of vector in the principal amount of up to  as amended on november   and the outstanding principal and interest balance owed to vector as of october   was  we believe this revolving credit arrangement provides us with access to capital sufficient until we consummate a merger or other business combination if we later determine that our capital reserves are insufficient we will either cease operations or we will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares or through debt there is no existing commitment to provide additional capital in such situation there can be no assurance that we shall be able to receive additional financing and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing upon acceptable terms it is likely that our business would cease operations

promissory note in favor of vector in the principal amount of up to  as amended on november   which had an outstanding principal and interest balance of  as of october   we may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt including loans from related parties to acquire sufficient liquidity to satisfy our future liabilities such additional capital may not be available timely or on terms acceptable to us if at all our plans to repay our liabilities as they become due may be impacted adversely by our inability to have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy our liabilities contractual obligations as a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b of the exchange act and in item f of regulation sk we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this section off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements multi soft ii inc a development stage company critical accounting policies and estimates our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note  to our condensed financial statements included in this quarterly report on form q we believe the policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our condensed financial position and results of operations income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets since we have determined that it is more likely than not that we may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the future as of october   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  the carryforwards expire through the year  our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in section  of the internal revenue code the tax acts of some jurisdictions contain provisions which may limit the net operating loss carryforwards available to be used in any given year if certain events occur including significant changes in ownership interests as a result of various equity transactions management believes we experienced an ownership change in  as defined by section  of the internal revenue code which limits the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to the ownership change as calculated the section  limitation does not necessarily impact the ultimate recovery of the us net operating loss although it will defer the realization of the tax benefit associated with certain of the net operating loss carryforwards multi soft ii inc a development stage company special note regarding forwardlooking statements some of the statements

any particular geographical area or industry including both domestic and international companies the company does not have any revenues from operations and absent a merger or other combination with an operating company or a public or private sale of the companys equity or debt securities the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured the company will be dependent upon future loans or equity

from a credit facility agreement the credit facility with its majority shareholder if the company reaches the point where the company needs funds to remain in operation the company will attempt to raise funds from the companys present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt if in such situation the company is unable to raise funds from those parties it is likely that the companys business would cease operations in order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because the companys directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of

results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with multi soft ii incs condensed financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein overview our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry including both domestic and international companies we have negative working capital negative shareholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since  however we have issued an  revolving credit promissory note in favor of vector group ltd vector a majority shareholder in the principal amount of up to   as amended on june    which we believe provides us with access to sufficient capital for the next twelve months we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations our historical operating results disclosed in this form q are not meaningful to our future results we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to i investigating and analyzing business combinations ii filing of exchange act reports and iii consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts as needed to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders management or other investors we may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business that may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company that does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks  multi soft ii inc our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders which is likely to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex in order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of multi solutions ii inc an entity under common control each of our officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us and multi solutions ii inc whereby they have each agreed that we will not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until multi solutions ii inc has agreed to consummate a business combination if we consummate a business combination we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the otc bulletin board the “otcbb” and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the otcbb subsequent to such business combination in addition subsequent to such business combination we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several nasdaq markets or the nyse mkt either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future however in  the nasdaq nyse and nyse mkt adopted a “seasoning” requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing sec filings during this time although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least  million we may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the  million exception which could adversely impact our ability to access us stock exchanges there can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the otcbb or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange or quotation service or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any of those or any other stock exchange or quotation service if an active trading market for our shares does not develop the value and liquidity of our shares will be materially and adversely affected  multi soft ii

commitment from any such parties to provide funding aside from the credit facility if we reach the point where we need funds to remain in operation we will attempt to raise funds from our present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt if in such situation we are unable to raise funds from those parties it is likely that our business would cease operations as of october    we

arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to income taxes and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions our significant accounting policies are
