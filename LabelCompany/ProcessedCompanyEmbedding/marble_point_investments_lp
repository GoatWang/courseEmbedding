partners august   by stan altshuller share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday marble arch investments faryan amirghassemi director of analytics every monday novus digs into the public holdings of a prominent hedge fund manager this week we take a look at marble arch investments marble arch is a prime example of the wildly successful lineage of julian robertson’s tiger management its founder scott mclellan worked at hound partners whose founder jonathan auerbach worked at tiger this “family tree” of hedge funds has produced prolific and successful longshort equity managers and marble arch investments is no exception what is particularly interesting to study is the “family resemblance” in investment style and underlying holdings for these managers about our data everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance marble arch investments and hound partners while we’ve talked extensively about the similarity in portfolio structure between tiger lineage managers many have noted the tremendous overlap between hound and its sibling marble arch as of the most recent f filings  of marble arch’s portfolio is owned by hound while that sounds a lot prior quarters have been nearly  both managers take meaty positions in names such as valeant pharmaceuticals fleetcor technologies and spirit aerosystems these are of course tiger lineage favorites as most of these names hold in excess of  participants through our capture of all tiger “family members” before you prematurely conclude that overlap is a bad thing our data shows that tiger cub consensus names greatly outperform and the same can’t be said about all unique stocks most of these are world class managers and the securities they invest in have compounded at exceptional rates so perhaps they are on to something recent marble arch outperformance marble arch’s simulated long portfolio performance has been outpacing the sp  by about bps per year since our first public data capture in jan  a large amount of the portfolio’s outperformance began after the us debt ceiling crisis in the rd quarter of  structural changes if we look at their portfolio since then a few things become apparent in terms of structural changes the portfolio has reduced the number of long positions from a peak of   to  as of the most recent filing as a corollary portfolio concentration has risen dramatically constituting a  relative increase in terms of top   top  position concentration this has led to a greater allocation of larger positions in the portfolio as positions greater than  of reported assets have gone from nonexistent to nearly  of the book in the last  months that largest position size bucket has annualized at an astounding  which shows why the move to a more concentrated portfolio explains the widening outperformance we can truly isolate position sizing value add by comparing an equal weighted portfolio to their actual return profile this allows us to measure how additive the escalation in concentration has been for marble arch’s portfolio we estimate it has added nearly  bps of outperformance since september  finally if we simply sort the names with the highest average weighting during this period we can see a strong relationship between sizing and outsized return on invested capital in fact there has only been one notable miss applied materials amongst overweight positions this phenomenon is punctuated by the firm’s positioning in valeant which has been a huge driver of outperformance delivering over bps of simulated contribution with these trends we can see the manager engaging in a higher octane investment style with a clear escalation in the median pe of the portfolio as well as a widening negative beta to value conclusion marble arch’s reported long positions have had an extended period of outperformance beginning in late  this has coincided with a strong move towards increased concentration and is dominated by a growthfactor tilt the manager continues to outperform the market and has demonstrated adaptability in the past the question is whether or not this trend of amplified concentration and growth bias will persist if the market begins to change in tenor three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success investment skill what’s in the report analysis of a top longshort equity fund analysis of a top sector specialist analysis of a top longonly manager download our
