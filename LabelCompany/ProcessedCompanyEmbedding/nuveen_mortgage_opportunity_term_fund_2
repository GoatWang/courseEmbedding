various risks including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties liquidity risks interest rate risks structure risks and geographical concentration riskscredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposesinterest rate risk fixedincome securities such as bonds preferred

is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage including swaps may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitslimited term risk it is anticipated that the fund will terminate and liquidate its assets and return the proceeds to its shareholders on or before a specific date although it could terminate sooner or later under certain conditions  the fund may be required to sell

that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmbs prepayment risk mbs represent an interest in a pool of mortgages these mortgages typically permit borrowers to prepay amounts owing often with no penalty  in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments tends to increase forcing a fund to reinvest in loweryielding securities  however prepayment risk for a mbs may not be the same as call risk for a corporate bond of

mac there is hope it’s called home affordable refinance program harp introduced in march  harp enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance harp targets borrowers with loantovalue ltv ratios equal to or greater than  percent and who have limited delinquencies over the  months prior to refinancing significant changes have been made to harp since the program was first introduced for example in  the ltv ceiling was removed property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances certain risk fees for borrowers selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated and certain representations and warranties were waived in  the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by fannie mae or freddie mac to the date on the note increasing the pool of eligible borrowers through harp you can get a lower interest rate which means less outofpocket costs each month get a shorter loan term or change from an adjustable to fixedrate mortgage there’s no minimum credit score needed either and now that harp guidelines are simpler even people who were formerly turned down may now be
