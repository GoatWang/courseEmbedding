purchased lg top of line frig within  mos have had two service calls now fridge temp is  degrees called for service and was told they would provide a list of people to call for service they refused to call for warranty service called store mgr who was busy and would call back that was tues am it is now thurs on wed called store to learn mgr was off wednesday and an assistant took info n would chk and call me back meanwhile throwing out food for the third time in three months also the water filter cracked i suspect it froze and dumped water in unit and damaged our hardwood floor would recommend

board may   by j s n poor customer service i walked into hhgregg and there are several salesman standing on the showroom floor not with customers they stare at you and wait for you to come up to them that is not my idea of a good salesman i was offered a service plan which i respectfully declined after about the fifth time he offered me the service plan he had a passive aggressive attitude with me this is very frustrating and the salesman at hhgregg should probably go through training to learn how to work better with people i will not shop here again the hhgregg on north side of indianapolis in

pains me to say buy hhgreggs no service no care and no future mar   by best buy customer worst customer service experience ever my wife and i brought a  inch samsung smart  d television from hh gregg we were told in store that it would be delivered on the following wednesday evening we were also told that we would receive a phone the night before notifying us on what time the tv would be delivered we never received the phone call we had to reschedule the deilvery twice because neither my wife or i could rearrance our schedules to meet with hh gregg at their convenient time when the tv was delivered the delivery men plugged the tv in and hooked the hdmi cable into it but never explained how to use any of the functions the last comment the men said before leaving the house was you will receive a phone call in a few minutes to rate our service please give us s i did not give them s the following monday i receive a phone call from someone asking why i gave such low rating i explained why and he said he would have someone come to our house to explain the tv on wednesday night no one ever showed up then i get an accusing phone call on thursday saying i called and left a message but you never called me back i did not receive any messages on wedanesay knowing that technology is not always  reliable i called hh gregg back they stated that we could have someone come to our and explain the tv but we would have to work our schedule around hh greggs again this is not possible both me and my wife are very busy this has got to be the worst delivery customer service i have every dealt with especially when they lie to your face in the store we will never do business with hh gregg again we will also spread the word to all those interested in buying a new appliancetv or other

back to me i have never had issues with home depot  sears etc feb   by laurie service the worst customer service i have ever seen just trying to speak to anyone regarding a problem with their rebate

in pembroke pines fl  but i had to return the product value of  and no one care the worst delivery service ever because the delivery people were unprofessional and didn’t care or had any customer service skills the refrigerator was a bit big to fit over the door but they didn’t even try to just leave the refrigerator at my home and then i would have a way to lift it up and accommodate it myself they just didn’t even try to do that their attitude was they were an outsource company and didn’t care about the sales and they were only at my home for probably  minutes didn’t make any effort to find a solution or a suggestion for this reason and this extremely bad service i returned all the product and i will never do any business with hhgregg and it is obvious they don’t care feb   by
