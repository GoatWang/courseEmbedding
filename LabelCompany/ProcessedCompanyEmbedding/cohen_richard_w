and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan yearif you plan to go to the doctor need medication or have been recommended for surgery call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
