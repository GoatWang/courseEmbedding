company information website httpwwwedenshieldcom sector agricultural products  related activities location jerusalem israel eden shield is the producer of a novel plant extract that makes crops odorless to insects this helps prevent several billion dollars worth of damage to crops annually and reduces insecticide use by up to   reasons to take a look  patented odormasking technology edenshield has developed a bioinsecticide based on a plant extract that masks the odor of crops making them undetectable to common insects it is effective for tomatoes peppers herbs medical cannabis etc by comparison traditional insecticides protect crops by poisoning insects as they eat the crops and inevitably end up being consumed by humans traditional insecticides rapidly become ineffective as insects become resistant to their effects in response farmers use increasingly higher quantities of insecticides to protect their crops eventually farmers are forced to stop using the insecticide either because the insects become immune or because of health and environmental regulations edenshield brings two key advantages over other solutions firstly since odor masking technology does not attack insects it is not subject to resistance and secondly the solution is entirely nontoxic edenshield has demonstrated in field trials that its solution reduces insects by  resulting in increased yield and a reduction of insecticide used on behalf of the farmer  progress since previous investment the company had eight successful israeli and european betasites in  which led to  orders of its gatekeeper solution in h  additionally the company has built a pipeline of potential customers and distribution partners in spain italy greece mexico and israel expecting  new orders in h  edenshield also successfully tested and began initial sales for its foliar spray products targeted at home hydroponic systems and greenhouses including medicinal cannabis growers that are particularly sensitive to toxicity due the medical application of their crops furthermore the farm used to grow edenshield’s formulayielding crops has been expanded from a  acre plot preinvestment to a  acre plot today the yield per square meter has also been increased moreover the company continues to optimize the amount of active ingredient in its formula in order to bring down the cost of the product edenshield continues to engage with regulatory authorities and expects spain to be the first country in which it receives clearance for open field spraying allowing access to this much larger market the company also received its first granted us patent and filed several additional patents  addressing large and rapidlygrowing market in the near term edenshield’s product will be applied to screens and nets used in greenhouses the greenhouse cropprotection market is valued at  billion longer term edenshield’s solution will target the market for openfield insecticides valued at  billion the solution is effective against whiteflies thrips and tuta absoluta which collectively cause over  billion in crop damage despite billions of dollars spent on greenhouse crop protection and open field insecticides additionally a new and rapidly growing market opportunity for edenshield is the market for medical cannabis the same insects against which edenshield effectively protects traditional vegetableherbflower are three of the most common insects that damage cannabis crops  skilled management team with a strong industry trackrecord edenshield’s management is comprised of an eight person

establish a distribution network and reinforce the company’s team israeli scientists have been at the forefront of agrotech for decades this has included innovations in water conservation as well as the development of safer and less expensive ways to protect crops as a nation famous for establishing new farms in the desert israel was at the head of world agrotech before there even was such a thing as height tech today its strong environmental community has been blending israeli tech innovation with green tech edenshield’s nontoxic technology for insect control is based on extracts of medicinal plants endemic to israel’s semidesert the company boasts that by leveraging the beneficial characteristics of desert plants the product masks the odor of the crop and lowers insect attraction causing the insects to simply pursue feeding options elsewhere pests cause damage of more than  billion annually by direct damage to crops or through the transmission of devastating viruses conventional chemical pesticides are ineffective as insects quickly develop resistance even in a single growing season the edenshield material the firm asserts sustains its efficacy throughout the entire growing season of the crop and insects do not develop resistance to it a natural material the edenshield product can be used close to harvest without health risks associated with conventional pesticides the company’s first product net is applied to greenhouse screens its second product direct is applied directly to greenhouses flowers and medical cannabis tests demonstrated that
