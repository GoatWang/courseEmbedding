following the june  brexit vote with unemployment falling to its lowest level since  eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region despite heightened political uncertainty emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors including attractive valuations and a weakening in the us dollar in this environment the global equity market registered a strong gain led by emerging markets returns were also positive — albeit more modest — for local currency and us dollardenominated emerging market sovereign debt and for us cre dit the treasury yield curve flattened as short rates rose and long rates dipped slightly falling oil prices contributed to a loss in the broad commodity market performance summary  eaton

oil the equity sleeve had minimal impact on global macro absolute return fund but was a slight detractor in global macro absolute return advantage fund corporate credit hurt performance for both funds in terms of regions eastern europe was the top contributor to fund performance and western europe was the nextlargest contributor the favorable results in eastern europe were due to currency sovereign credit and rates exposures including long positi ons in the russian ruble and russian rates russias economy has been recovering and inflation has fallen more quickly than expected prompting the central bank to cut interest rates and signal more rate cuts in  long investments in cypriot and turk ish sovereign credit boosted returns in the region as well in western europe a strong gain from long exposure to the icelandic krona versus the euro drove results in the region latin america also positively impacted returns helped by rates and sovereign credit exposures notable contributors included a long rates position in colombia where the central bank eased policy and a long sovereign credit position in brazil where ec onomic improvement led a major ratings agency to raise its credit outlook on the country the dollar bloc added a modest amount of value in global macro absolute return advantage fund however its performance was flat in global macro absolute return fun d within the

added significant value despite retreating in march the krona strengthened against the euro over the full quarter amid a tourism boom in iceland that is fueling strong ec onomic growth long investments in the russian ruble and turkish sovereign credit were also especially helpful other top contributors included long positions in the colombian peso and indonesian rupiah which performed well amid broad us dollar weakne ss following its rapid fourthquarter rise the dollar declined in response to concerns about how quickly trumps progrowth policies would be implemented given congressional opposition detractors  factors detracting from the funds performance during the quarter consistent with us dollar weakness the list of detractors was dominated by short currency positions chief among these were shorts in the chinese yuan omani rial euro and mexican peso investment outlook and fund positioning  we expect a wide range of potential investment outcomes due to the change in us political leadership while markets appear to have priced in fiscal spending lower taxes and less regulation trade policy remains a key factor that will have a significan t impact on the global economy and the individual countries the team covers beyond the united states chinas capital account management and multiple european elections are likely to drive volatility in financial markets and further consolidation in oi l markets may continue to stress those middle east producers with inadequate fiscal capacity to absorb lower commodity prices against this backdrop we have positioned the funds to be more sensitive to countrylevel factors rather than broad macro facto rs as we expect countrylevel factors to be the main drivers of their performance going forward at quarterend both funds foreign currency positioning was net long long us dollar and euro positions versus select emerging and frontier market currencies balance the risk credit spread duration was
