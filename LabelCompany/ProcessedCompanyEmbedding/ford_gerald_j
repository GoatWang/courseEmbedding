the gerald r ford “the president was so excited almost ebullient even though his health was fading to know that this ship was going to be named for him” willard who worked as a staff assistant to ford said earlier this weekhe recounted the conversation while surrounded by photos and mementos of the th president in the new carrier’s tribute roomnearly  years after that call the navy’s most expensive

her father like many veterans told few stories from his service he did talk about “halsey’s typhoon” which lashed the monterey with swells up to  feet and nearly knocked him overboard according to a defense department news release waves and winds tore fighter planes loose from their cables and a blaze erupted in the hangar bay as the aircraft collided igniting fuel tanks as the fire spread ford

usmanufactured productsbut trump who is expected to land by marine helicopter on the ford’s flight deck saturday will set foot on a firstinitsclass ship that has for years been hammered by congress and the government accountability office for cost overruns reliability issues and construction delaysthe gao again dinged the ford last week in a report examining the navy’s postdelivery shipbuilding processes saying it could face “unknown quality” risks because it was delivered in late may with “a substantial amount of incomplete work” the report said about four years and at least  million worth of work remains to address deficiencies complete construction and finish tests and trials before the ship becomes combatreadythat work is incorporated into the ford’s nearly  billion price tag capt thurraya kent a spokeswoman for the assistant secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition said in a statement thursday“like all newly commissioned ships cvn  will undergo postshakedown availability to correct any deficiencies deferred from its initial builder’s and acceptance trials to work out maintenance discrepancies and to update equipment” kent saidthe ford incorporates so many advanced technologies including a new nuclear reactor plant propulsion system dualband radar and systems to launch and land aircraft that navy leaders have said the new carrier class is virtually incomparable to the ship nimitz class that preceded itjerry hendrix a retired navy captain and director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the center for a new american security said with all those technologies loaded into a firstofitsclass carrier the amount of work left to do before the ford can deploy is without precedent any additional problems that arise that threaten to push the ford further into the future would only strain the rest of the fleet hendrix said“we’re almost a generation removed from the decisionmakers but now we’re dealing with

that this ship was going to be named for him” willard who worked as a staff assistant to ford said earlier this weekhe recounted the conversation while surrounded by photos and mementos of the th president in the new carrier’s tribute roomnearly  years after that call the navy’s most expensive and technologically advanced warship is poised to join the fleetas many as  people are expected to

trump’s visit to to the ford also stands as a gray bookend to the administration’s “made in america week” a campaign to highlight usmanufactured productsbut trump who is expected to land by marine helicopter on the ford’s flight deck saturday will set foot on a firstinitsclass ship that has for years been hammered by congress and the government accountability office for cost overruns reliability issues and construction delaysthe gao again dinged the ford last week in a report examining the navy’s postdelivery shipbuilding processes saying it could face “unknown quality” risks because it was delivered in late may with “a substantial amount of incomplete work” the report said about four years and at least  million worth of work remains to address deficiencies complete construction and finish tests and trials before the ship becomes combatreadythat work is incorporated into the ford’s nearly  billion price tag capt thurraya kent a spokeswoman for the assistant secretary of the navy for research development and acquisition said in a statement thursday“like all newly commissioned ships cvn  will undergo postshakedown availability to correct any deficiencies deferred from its initial builder’s and acceptance trials to work out maintenance discrepancies and to update equipment” kent saidthe ford incorporates so many advanced technologies including a new nuclear reactor plant propulsion system dualband radar and systems to launch and land aircraft that navy leaders have said the new carrier class is virtually incomparable to the ship nimitz class that preceded itjerry hendrix a retired navy captain and director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the center for a new american security said with all those technologies loaded into a firstofitsclass carrier the amount of work left to do before the ford can deploy is without precedent any additional problems that arise that threaten to push the ford further into the future would only strain the rest of the fleet hendrix said“we’re almost a generation removed from the decisionmakers but now we’re dealing with the effects of those decisions” he said courtney mabeus

conduct i have not sought this enormous responsibility but i will not shirk it those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends they were of both parties

august   the watergate investigation continued following fords appointment until chief of staff alexander haig contacted ford on august   and told him that smoking gun evidence had been found the

before becoming the first vice president to move into the new vice presidents official residence at number one observatory circle however al haig asked to come over and see me ford later related to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a monday and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation and he said im just

resignation that elevated ford to the presidency nixons chief of staff alexander haig offered a deal to ford bob woodward in his book shadow recounts the haig deal woodward recounts that haig entered fords office on august   while ford was still vice president and nixon had yet to resign haig told ford that there were three pardon options  nixon could pardon himself and resign  nixon could pardon his aides involved in watergate and then resign or  nixon could agree to leave in return for an agreement that the new president would pardon him after listing these options haig handed ford various papers one of these papers included a discussion of the presidents legal authority to pardon and another sheet was a draft pardon form that only needed fords signature and nixons name to make it legal woodward summarizes the setting between haig and ford as follows even if haig offered no direct words on his views the message was almost certainly sent an emotional man haig was incapable of concealing his feelings those who worked closely with him rarely found him ambiguous despite the situation ford never accepted the offer from haig and later decided to pardon nixon on his own terms
