point determined by the paris accord we are all together and we have to act now to create this change regardless of today’s politics” “i am the ceo of an engineering company that designs healthcare facilities around the world” said walt vernon ceo of mazzetti “here in the us we are now facing design challenges like warmer temperatures than historic requiring more air conditioning and more energy we are facing issues of flood in coastal areas that did not experience them before we are starting to think about the effects of weather disasters in ways we never did and in our international work we are seeing even more clearly the impacts of climate change on lives of people” “its a simple truth that green policies are good for our economy” said zach tucker founder of goodmeetsworld swift action is needed in the coming years to not only protect our environment but to protect the future of our economy as well” “clean technology is a major engine of job growth in the united states and is key to overcoming the challenge of climate change said dave hudson ceo of vigilent “vigilent strongly supports continued us participation in the paris agreement as the best means to address the climate challenge with global cooperation” “the paris agreement was a vital step forward but its power is in our collective action” said lara birkes chief sustainability officer hewlett packard enterprise “business and government leaders must urgently work together to drive a thriving lowcarbon economy”   “it is vital that the business community demonstrates its ongoing commitment to tackling climate change” said barry parkin chief sustainability and health and wellbeing officer at mars incorporated “this is an important moment in global political and economic history and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet climate change water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society it is imperative that global businesses like mars do their part to face down those threats” “elections change our leadership but they don’t change reality” said matthew hamilton sustainability director at aspen skiing company “thirty more frost free days are thirty fewer days we can make snow increasing the pressure on our business the paris agreement is critical to our business and the  million employees of the outdoor recreation industry” “blue cross

environmental health at blue cross blue shield of massachusetts “we strongly support continued us participation in the paris agreement to help address climate change one of our biggest public health threats today” “delivering on the paris agreement is an opportunity and responsibility for all” said feike sijbesma ceo and chairman of the managing board royal dsm “now is the time to future proof our economies by investing in among other lowcarbon infrastructure together we can create new jobs and build our infrastructure while securing clean air and sustainable energy this is key for people today and generations to come”  “reynders mcveigh capital management llc reaffirms our support of the paris climate agreement to ensure we are doing our part to get to a low carbon future” said maria arabatzis portfolio manager and shareholder engagement manager at reynders mcveigh capital management llc “kentucky needs to grow its clean economy more than many other states” said zaurie zimmerman ceo of the lion company in louisville kentucky “as ceo of the lion company inc a  year old family business i am hopeful that presidentelect trump is pragmatic enough to see the jobgrowing potential of the clean energy transition  affirming the us commitment to the paris agreement is a crucial strategy in keeping the us and eventually kentucky truly competitive in the global economy”   “sugarbush is fully committed to doing our part to reduce our carbon foot print and address climate change” said win smith president of sugarbush resort “in recent years we have converted our entire snowmaking system to using energy efficient guns installed led and florescent lighting on the majority of our resort implemented composting in all of our kitchens and in some cafeterias partnered in the development of six solar farms with a combined estimated annual generation rate of  megawatts of electricity introduced reusable plates and cutlery in key dining facilities and encouraged the use of reusable tumblers for our employees’ hydration we have also made significant progress on a longterm plan to improve our local streams and brooks in partnership with local organizations climate change is real and we are doing our part to combat it” “longterm stable financial returns are dependent upon a stable and resilient climate” said adam kanzer managing director domini social investments llc “the goal established by the paris agreement to limit average temperature increases to  degrees celsius over preindustrial levels with a target of  degrees is not simply a good idea it is an

by american sustainable business council ces ceres environmental defense fund environmental entrepreneurs the b team the climate group we mean business and world wildlife fund wwf business backs lowcarbon usa kicked off in december  with a fullpage ad in the wall street journal urging us and international leaders to adopt an ambitious climate agreement in paris companies also joined together in april  to welcome the signing of the paris agreement and to call for a just transition to a clean energy economy if your organization would like more information on how to participate please

essentially pure cnts without the use of binders and additives our process is scalable to large volume manufacturing and cost effective dexmat’s cnt fibers and films conduct electricity like metals yet have the flexibility lightweight and corrosion resistance qualities of polymers—the best of both worlds previousnext brief history of dexmat the fundamental technology used by dexmat was developed over the last ten years by a multitude of researchers in prof pasquali’s lab at rice university professor pasquali’s vision to build a  cntbased macroobject from an infinite number of nanosized cnt molecules using a process that could be scaled to large volume manufacturing culminated with the highly cited research paper published in science  jan  pp  late in  dexmat’s founders met in houston to
