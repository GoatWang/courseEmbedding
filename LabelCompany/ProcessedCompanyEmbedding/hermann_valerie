boost can ralph lauren expect fani kelesidou fanikel feb   at am word came last week that ralph lauren nyserl appointed valerie hermann president of its luxury collections a newly created post at the new yorkbased fashion powerhouse she will be responsible for strategy merchandising distribution and overall expansion of the global luxury business ralph lauren said in a press release hermann headed up operations at yves saint laurent until  and most recently served as president and ceo of reed krakoff going forward what are ralph laurens opportunities and challenges in the luxury business more importantly what will hermann bring to the table ralph lauren flagship store at madison avenue  the outlook for luxury goods research firm euromonitor remains bullish on the industrys growth prospects overall it anticipates continued momentum in asia pacific to boost global spending by more than  over the next four years according to the latest edition of its annual passport luxury goods report

lauren is pinning its hopes on chinese consumers bolstering its luxury business its spending more on advertising marketing and pr activity for the opening of the first dualgender flagship store in china this fall and plans to expand points of distribution in the region increasing brand awareness among chinese consumers is critical for the company not only because demand from china is considered to be a key driver of future growth in the industry but also because the chinese like to shop while they travel peterson pointed out that highspending tourists from china are in the top five of the companys foreign customers in the us for the most recent quarter large numbers of chinese customers were out in force in european stores as well the valerie hermann effect hermann is the woman for the job she is a wellregarded executive with an impeccable resume and an impressive track record at some of the big names in the luxury space she started her career at the comité colbert the parisbased luxury goods trade association and went on to work at various positions at louis vuitton she served as ceo of saint laurent from  to  before joining reed krakoff she made a name for herself especially by helping yves saint laurent turn things around and get back in the black since yves saint laurents own retirement from readytowear in  which is usually more profitable than haute couture the company had struggled to make ends meet but in three years of calling the shots at the iconic brand hermann managed to turn a profit the challenges in the ever competitive and enormous american market for someone who has spent her career in europe should not be overlooked however her expertise in the european markets might prove to be exactly what ralph lauren needs right now at  of consolidated revenues europe remains a significant area of opportunity for the company both in wholesale and retail channels over the past year or so macroeconomic headwinds in the region forced ralph lauren to pull back on shipments particularly in the wholesale channel going forward the company intends to make a dynamic comeback returning to its prerecession trajectory hermann knows how to turn ralph
