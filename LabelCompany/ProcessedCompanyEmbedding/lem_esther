believed in “why the  would we waste good money on that” those words spoken by the cfo of the company where i was employed erased all of the good feelings we’d developed during a weeklong team building session in the french countryside let me back up as the vice president of marketing running the only “investgrow” category in the company i was struggling to identify ideas that would accelerate growth we needed a new brand launch and i felt that axe – a successful global male brand – would be the perfect candidate after all in focus groups guys were stealing the product they loved the ads but quantitative testing showed modest results at best during that offsite event i proposed the launch opportunity repeatedly but everyone knocked it down on the last day we had a group session with all the senior executives in one location i knew this was my final shot at making something big out of something small while the idea of speaking up in the group session knowing that none of the senior executives had expressed support made my stomach turn i felt the topic had to be debated “why not invest in growing the category and launch axe” i asked crickets that led to the cfo’s question “why the  would we waste good money on that” even more crickets then another executive spoke up acknowledging this inappropriate behavior he asked to hear my case right then and there it was a watershed moment for me i learned to stand my ground and fight for what i believed in and after a few rounds of discussion my points had not only been heard but also accepted axe did launch that year and it proved to be an overwhelming success it blew away our goals and turned out to be a catalyst for company growth a second launch followed and the category became a “darling” for the company i felt victorious i’m often asked why i a female thought i could market axe the only male brand at the company “why not” i reply “throughout my entire career i’ve only ever worked for men marketing female brands” share this story share this story even better together join a lean in circle to learn from career experts—and your peers learn more read more stories rene syler tv personality melody
