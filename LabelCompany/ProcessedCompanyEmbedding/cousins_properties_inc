inc has kept pace with its evolving business environment by leveraging multiple business solutions as part of its yardi voyager property management and accounting platform “we like the idea of an integrated system we wanted yardi as our solution and it has been the right choice for us” said dennis granger vice president of information systems for cousinsthe challengetechnology upgrade neededcousins prides itself on having bestinclass assets and a strong balance sheet that allow the company to capitalize quickly on new acquisition opportunities recent acquisitions and mergers added dozens of properties and millions of square feet to its portfolio meeting increased reporting obligations and service expectations for its growing clientele required new solutions for tenant services consolidations reporting and maintenancethe solutionyardi commercial suitewith yardi voyager established as its core platform cousins connected with tenants online automated budgeting expanded reporting and extended mobility to its maintenance staffthe storyimproved tenant service“before commercialcafé and advanced maintenance tenants had to call the property management office if nobody was available the response could be delayed now our engineers can go straight to their mobile devices without any intervening steps and get right to the request it saves time for everybody and the maintenance record goes straight into the tenant ledger in voyager” said granger new dimensions for budgeting “advanced budgeting  forecasting strengthens our control of the budgeting process by making it easy to reforecast quarterly property accountants managers and others can work their pieces of the budget simultaneously in addition the solution helps us streamline rent calculations depreciations and other factors” attanucci said she added “we do our budgets to a degree that would make most people lose their minds the level of detail we expect to see and drill into equals or exceeds anybody else’s and the integrated solution from yardi makes that possible” new consolidation drilldown and reporting “yardi investment management also helped us with the special way we consolidate our legal entity structure if an asset was  owned we had to add across and make manual consolidation entries if it was  owned we multiplied it out by  booked it as a consolidating entry and added all of the consolidating entries now we have a much more efficient rollup structure in addition rolebased access to voyager lets the tax people see what went through any given legal entity” attanucci said granger added “yardi investment management gives us the ability to look from the top down which is really helpful—we can see what we’re reporting to the sec on our consolidated statements and we can see individual property information we can take those numbers drill down and create yardi spreadsheet reports to see what’s coming from certain entities and properties “we’re also pleased with the ability to deliver a battery of reports to upper management every month it no longer takes days to get them together and we don’t have to call the accountants for the information” constructing precision “yardi construction management gives us visibility into our construction budgets that we couldn’t get from the spreadsheets we previously used” granger said “we also have process consistency—development managers no longer keep track their own way with different details and update schedules with construction integrated into the general ledger we have consistent reporting and workflows for budgeting and approvals across the board” “we have good systems and a solid balance sheet in place this combination gives us the means to pursue acquisitions

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
