brownphilpot hire leaders leave to take risks stacy brownphilpot hire leaders leave to take risks leadershipwrittenstacy brownphilpot hire leaders leave to take risksthe taskrabbit ceo is used to being the first — and blazing a path for those who will followapril  by mary duan email find a job that offers exciting risks suggests taskrabbit ceo stacy brownphilpot  istockjdawnink when stacy brownphilpot took the helm in  at taskrabbit the venturebacked online marketplace that matches freelance labor called “taskers” with local demand she became the first black woman ceo of a tech company in silicon valley at the time of the announcement taskrabbit founder and ceo leah busque said brownphilpot “is someone who knows how to scale and build the kind of strong partnerships we need to really grow” stacy brownphilpot  courtesy of taskrabbit brownphilpot grew up in detroit studied her way into the ivy league the wharton school at university of pennsylvania and did a turn in investment banking where working on tech deals piqued her interest in the valley she earned her mba at stanford in  and by  she had joined google as a financial director she then became a senior director of google’s global consumer operations and an entrepreneurinresidence at google ventures along her paths she focused on filling the pipeline with diverse candidates she founded the black googler network to attract develop and retain black talent at the company she joined the board of hp inc at the invitation of meg whitman whom she met at a party for women executives at sheryl sandberg’s house and she’s on the board of black girls code the nonprofit that draws girls of color to programming engineering app development robotics and other stem fields brownphilpot spoke to insights on her way home from the airport after a multiday business trip to chicago pausing the conversation just long enough to greet an exuberant child screaming “mommy” as she walked through the door how does your own sense of values manifest in your leadership style i think that many of my lessons have been around being authentic as a leader being fully who i am as a person and allowing that authenticity to shape my leadership style i was a different leader when i worked in india with google earlier i joined companies that shared my values and now i get to shape a company that reflects my values i’ve learned to connect the individual to the collective we are trying to create i value honesty and integrity and character means everything to me my favorite quote on this is from martin luther king jr who said “the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy” that is the true representation of a leader how is taskrabbit a meaningful part of the sharing economy i like to focus on taskrabbit as a job creator a place and a platform for people to earn a living income and choosing a more flexible way to work to earn the money they need to achieve the life they want to have every day i meet someone paying for their grandchild to go to college or saving money to go to school — there are a whole bunch of reasons and we’re just creating everyday work for everyday people without the power of technology we wouldn’t have been able to create this platform for that to happen you’re coming up on a year as ceo what’s gone right one of the things that’s gone right is we’ve doubled the size of the business by investing in the mobile product we’re now half mobile more than double than before we took the experience and learned what the customer really wants and invested in the technology that really works for her you can post a task in three clicks we’re hiring for leadership and i want to know is that person going to be a strong person in my organization can they be thoughtful can they take an idea and run with it and figure out how to make something happenstacy brownphilpot at the end of the year we had an opportunity in the form of a partnership with ikea it launched in december  in london they really wanted to tackle the uk first and expand from there you can add the service to your cart and have someone come and put your furniture together they came to us on a tour of silicon valley and they were very interested in meeting with different interesting companies we sat down with their group membership we had already done thousands of ikea furniture jobs and it helped them with their customer satisfaction they realized we should work more closely together looking at your career and your involvements — from being on the board of black girls code and launching the black googler network — it’s clear that mentorship is an important part of what you do how did being mentored play a role early in your career early in my career i wasn’t mentored i grew up in detroit and everybody who was successful there was a doctor or a lawyer that’s why i spend a lot of time with women or girls who look like me to say “here’s another choice that can be equally as interesting and important” i had a lot of male mentors in my career and then at google i worked closely with sheryl sandberg who was the first female mentor i had there were people who helped push me and nudge me and nobody told me about coding or tech when i was young enough to pursue it that’s why i focus on young girls in school to let them know it’s a valuable choice but you also didn’t start out in tech i was working in investment banking at goldman sachs and was excited about working on tech deals with one company being sold and one going public and i thought “wow these companies are creating a lot of value” that’s how i got fascinated by tech and coming to stanford graduate school of business was the perfect way to learn how silicon valley works and how tech companies are creating value and the meaning of entrepreneurship it has the power to change lives further than you can imagine at stanford gsb you feel it in the school but it’s also the essence of silicon valley that’s when i decided i wanted to be a part of this work and this is where i wanted to begin the next phase of my career that next phase took you to google where you had a long run as an executive before you decided to leave how hard was that decision i like to think i had to break up with google it was a good boyfriend but i felt like “can i be in this relationship forever” i wanted to take risks and grow as a person it wasn’t that such risks didn’t exist at google but they weren’t the ones that most excited me at the time it was hard i still miss a lot of what google represents i’m a huge fan how do you keep your physical and mental health strong i swim twice a week i started swimming because my second pregnancy was very hard and my ob said “try swimming” i wasn’t very good at it but i got better and it’s very relaxing we also have meditation time once a week at taskrabbit — thursday at  pm when i’m at the office i sit in a room and meditate with other people what kind of advice do you have for the mbas coming up through stanford gsb right now we’re hiring for leadership and i want to know is that person going to be a strong person in my organization can they be thoughtful can they take an idea and run with it and figure out how to make something happen are they good at leading others and managing as a manager my no  job is to hire the best people and develop them it’s really about the team and the people you build around you taskrabbit is in  cities and in the uk and it’s a growing part of the sharing economy but there’s been some unfortunate news recently about other companies in the space — specifically the piece written by susan fowler the former uber engineer about the harassment and discrimination she faced during her time there what are your thoughts on what she wrote and how the company has responded i think the power of community is a real thing and what uber has built is a company powered by the people who make the business work — the drivers riders and people who participate in the sharing economy these things have happened at other companies and it almost never makes it to this level but the expectations of companies that touch our lives are extremely high we have a responsibility to take care of the people who work for us i’m proud fowler had the courage to say what she said and write what she wrote and that the community has supported her stacy brownphilpot won stanford gsb black business student

are afraid to fail the most successful leaders in technology started out doing the opposite of what everyone thinks they should dorelationships matter the tech industry moves fast and survives on the rapid exchange of information building your network and surrounding yourself with a diverse set of smart thinkers helps you make better faster decisionsbe comfortable with you my best employees bring their whole selves to work every day being who you are helps you align your values with those of your coworkers and the company it is only then that optimal results are achievedwhat are the three biggest lessons you’ve learned in going from a big company from google to a smaller company like taskrabbitthe pace is much faster you often have to make decisions with a lot less certainty in a short amount of time this is where intuition and judgment matters more than anything elselearning to manage my emotional energy at a startup the highs are really high and the lows are really low and as an executive your job is to absorb it all celebrate successes learn from failures and keep the team moving forwardeverything still takes longer than you think and there are always surprises it is expected at a big company that things take longer because of bureaucracy politics and other coordination costs but things also take longer at startups because market dynamics change so fast and what you thought was the easiest path from point a to b suddenly becomes very difficult because new information was introduced to manage this i make sure i understand a what is in my control and what is not and b what are the biggest levers for our business so that when one of those is impacted i can react quickly i would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who i am as a person what advice do you have for people considering executive roles in startupsi always advise people considering a career move to choose to go to something not move away from what you are already doing in the case of startups go because you want that experience and not because you are not happy in your current role at the executive level it is also important to align your personal values with that of the company and the founding team i play a critical role in shaping the culture at taskrabbit and ultimately our success i would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who i am as a person finally get ready to do the work as an executive at a large company i could depend on my team for a lot now i have to work alongside my team roll up my sleeves identify product bugs talk to unhappy users change the toilet paper in the bathroom etc it’s part of the experience and i love itwho is one person you follow on social media who you think others should followmichelle obama role model and

rapid exchange of information building your network and surrounding yourself with a diverse set of smart thinkers helps you make better faster decisionsbe comfortable with you my best employees bring their whole selves to work every day being who you are helps you align your values with those of your coworkers and the company it is only then that optimal results are achievedwhat are the three biggest lessons you’ve learned in going from a big company from google to a smaller company like taskrabbitthe pace is much faster you often have to make decisions with a lot less certainty in a short amount of time this is where intuition and judgment matters more than anything elselearning to manage my emotional energy at a startup the highs are really high and the lows are really low and as an executive your job is to absorb it all celebrate successes learn from failures and keep the team moving forwardeverything still takes longer than you think and there are always surprises it is expected at a big company that things take longer because of bureaucracy politics and other coordination costs but things also take longer at startups because market dynamics change so fast and what you thought was the easiest path from point a to b suddenly becomes very difficult because new information was introduced to manage this i make sure i understand a what is in my control and what is not and b what are the biggest levers for our business so that when one of those is impacted i can react quickly i would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who i am as a person what advice do you have for people considering executive roles in startupsi always advise people considering a career move to choose to go to something not move away from what you are already doing in the case of startups go because you want that experience and not because you are not happy in your current role at the executive level it is also important to align your personal values with that of the company and the founding team i play a critical role in shaping the culture at taskrabbit and ultimately our success i would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who i am as a person finally get ready to do the work as an executive at a large company i could depend on my team for a lot now i have to work alongside my team roll up my sleeves identify product bugs talk to unhappy users change the toilet paper in the bathroom etc it’s part of the experience and i love itwho is one person you follow on social media who you think others should followmichelle obama role model and
