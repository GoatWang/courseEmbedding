registrants bylaws item b of this registration statement provides in summary that officers and trusteesdirectors shall be indemnified by registrant against liabilities and expenses incurred by such

suite or proceeding is asserted against the registrant by such director trustee officer or controlling person or principal underwriter in connection with the shares being registered the registrant will unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against

enforcement a     review statements and confirmations or any related reporting made via the pta system will be periodically reviewed by the cco or hisher designee among the factors that will be considered in the analysis of whether any provision of the code has been violated will be actual harm to client accounts the access person’s job function with greater scrutiny applied to those involved in the investment process the access person’s prior compliance history the access person’s cooperation and demonstrated understanding of and willingness to comply with  the code including whether the violation was selfreported the size monetary value of the transaction the access person’s overall account size and historic trading volume and other extenuating circumstances eg the transaction was directed by an individual other than the access person such as a spouse or financial adviser annually the cco will prepare a written “issues and certification report” and provide such

severity of any violation or violations warrants such action any remedial action imposed upon a person will be documented in such persons personal trading file maintained by the cco the ceo must approve remedial actions involving termination monetary penalties censure or notice to regulatory authorities  the following is a list of remedial actions that may be imposed on persons who fail to comply with the code of ethics this list is not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive list and any remedial actions imposed will depend on the nature of the violation some of the remedial actions which may be imposed are • warningretraining • memorandum of reprimand which outlines the violation of the code • inperson meeting with the cco or designee or the general counsel to discuss compliance with the code • imposition of additional restrictions including prohibition on personal securities transactions • disgorgement of profits • letter of censure • fines • withholding of bonus •

transactions and any other information filed pursuant to this code shall be treated as confidential except as regards to appropriate examinations by representatives of the securities and exchange commission or other governmental or regulatory authorities i x    insider trading policy and procedures a     scope of policy statement this policy statement is drafted broadly it will be applied and interpreted in a similar manner this policy statement applies to securities trading and information handling by all access persons trusteedirectors officers temporary employees and interns referred to as “covered persons” for the purposes of this section ix  the law of insider trading is unsettled an individual legitimately may be uncertain about the application of the policy statement in a particular circumstance often a single question can forestall disciplinary action or complex legal problems you should direct any questions relating to the policy statement to an attorney in legalcompliance you must also notify the general counsel if you have any reason to believe that a violation of the policy statement has occurred or is about to occur  b     policy statement on insider trading calvert forbids any covered person from trading either personally or on behalf of others including clients on material nonpublic information or communicating material nonpublic information to others in violation of the law this conduct is frequently referred to as insider trading covered persons will be liable for any such conduct even where the covered person believes the conduct was not based on material nonpublic information calverts policy applies to each calvert fund its investment advisor its principal underwriter and every officer director and employee thereof and extends to activities within and outside their duties at calvert every covered person must read and retain this policy statement any questions regarding calverts policy and procedures should be referred to the general counsel a covered person must notify the general counsel immediately if they have any reason to believe that a violation of the policy statement has occurred or is about to occur the term insider trading is not defined in the federal securities laws but generally is used to refer to the use of material nonpublic information to trade in securities whether or not one is an insider or to communications of material nonpublic information to others while the law concerning insider trading is not static it is generally understood that the law prohibits  trading by an insider while in possession of material nonpublic information or  trading by a noninsider while in possession of material nonpublic information where the information either was disclosed to the noninsider in violation of an insiders duty to keep it confidential or was misappropriated or     communicating material nonpublic information to others who is an insider the concept of insider is broad it includes officers directors trustees and employees of a company in addition a person can be a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a companys affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the companys purposes a temporary insider can include among others a companys attorneys accountants consultants bank lending officers and the employees of such organizations in addition calvert may become a temporary insider of a company it advises or for which it performs other services what is material information trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is material material information generally is defined as information for which there is a substantial likelihood that a  reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions or information that is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a companys securities information that officers directors trustees and employees should consider material includes but is not limited to dividend changes earnings estimates changes in previously released earnings estimates significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements major litigation liquidation problems and extraordinary management developments material information also may relate to the market for a companys securities information about a significant order to purchase or sell securities may in some contexts be deemed material similarly prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press also may be deemed material it is conceivable that similar advance reports of securities to be bought or sold by a large influential institutional investor such as a fund may be deemed material to an investment in those portfolio securities advance knowledge of important proposed government regulation for example could also be deemed material information regarding companies in the regulated industry    what is nonpublic information information is nonpublic until it has been disseminated broadly to investors in the market place tangible evidence of such dissemination is the best indication that the information is public for example information is public after it has become available to the general public through a public filing with the sec or some other governmental agency the dow jones tape or the wall street journal or some other publication of general circulation and after sufficient time has passed so that the information has been disseminated widely c     penalties for insider trading penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information are severe both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers a person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violation penalties include • civil injunctions • treble damages • disgorgement of profits • jail sentences • fines for the person who committed the violation of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided whether or not the person actually benefited and • fines for the employer or other controlling person of up to the greater of  or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided  in addition any violation of this policy statement can be expected to result in serious sanctions by calvert up to and including dismissal of the persons involved d     contacts with public companies for calvert contacts with public companies represent an important part of our research efforts calvert may make investment decisions on the basis of the firms conclusions formed through such contacts and analysis of publicly available information difficult legal issues arise however when in the course of these contacts a covered person becomes aware of material  nonpublic information this could happen for example if a companys chief financial officer prematurely discloses quarterly results to an analyst or an investor relation representative makes a selective disclosure of adverse news to a handful of investors in such situation calvert must make a judgment as to its further conduct for the protection of the company and its employees the general counsel should be contacted if an employee believes that he or she has received material nonpublic information e     tender offers tender offers represent a particular concern in the law of insider trading for two reasons first tender offer activity often produces extraordinary gyrations in the price of the target companys securities trading during this time period is more likely to attract regulatory attention and produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases second the sec has adopted a rule which expressly forbids trading and tipping while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding a tender offer received from the tender offer or the target company or anyone acting on behalf of either covered persons should exercise particular caution any time they become aware of nonpublic information relating to a tender offer x    notices • obligation to report violations  any access person who has himself or herself or who discovers that another access person has violated or apparently violated any provision of this code of ethics must promptly report the matter to the cco • the cco has the authority to review records  the cco or designee may also request additional information to complete his or her compliance review and oversight  • your privacy  is extremely important and will be held in the utmost confidence but your reported information is subject to review and action by regulators and by appropriate personnel such as the ccoadvisor ccodistributor ccofunds and certain other members of the legal andor compliance departments xi    education another aspect of calverts compliance procedures will be to keep calvert associates and other access persons informed all calvert associates and other access persons will be trained on and be required to confirm their understanding and acknowledgment of the code and other specified policies and procedures periodically xii    discretionary authority of cco the cco reserves the authority to waive any provision of this code for good cause shown so long as such waiver is not contrary to the federal securities laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder additionally the cco reserves the authority to impose additional restrictions on any individual or group of individuals where necessary to uphold the general fiduciary
