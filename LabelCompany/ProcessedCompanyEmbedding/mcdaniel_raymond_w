the second quarter was  million up  operating income was  million up  and adjusted operating income of  million was up  we are defining adjusted operating income as operating income before depreciation amortization and bureau van dijk acquisition related expenses the operating margin was  up from  in the second quarter of  the adjusted operating margin was  up from  moodys diluted eps for the quarter was  per share up  from the second quarter of  adjusted diluted eps for the quarter was  up  second quarter  adjusted diluted eps excludes the  million or  per share unrealized gain from a eurodenominated purchase price hedge relating to the pending bureau van dijk acquisition as well as  million or  per share of acquisition related expenses turning to the first half performance moodys revenue for the first half  was almost  billion up  from the prior year period us revenue was  billion up  while nonus revenue was  million up  the impact of foreign currency translation was negligible moodys investors service first half revenue of almost  billion was up  from the prior year period us revenue was  million up  while nonus revenue was  million up  moodys analytics revenue for the first half of  was  million a  increase over the prior year us revenue of  million was up  while nonus revenue of  million was up  operating expense for the first half of  was almost  billion up  from the prior year period foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by  operating income was  million up  foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by  adjusted operating income of  million was up  moodys operating margin was  and its adjusted operating margin was  the effective tax rate for the first half of  was  down from  in the prior year period the decline was primarily due to a noncash nontaxable gain related to a strategic realignment and expansion involving moodys chinese affiliate ccxi as well as a benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation given the strength of the first half and a supportive market environment we are raising our full year  diluted eps guidance to a range of  to  this range includes the  per share ccxi gain the  per share purchase price hedge gain and  per share of bureau van dijk acquisition related expenses excluding these items we anticipate fullyear adjusted diluted eps to be in the range of  to  ill now turn the call over to linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates linda s huber thanks ray ill begin with revenue at the company level as ray mentioned moodys total revenue for the second quarter was a record  billion up  us revenue of  million was up  nonus revenue of  million was up  and represented  of moodys total revenue the impact of foreign currency translation on moodys revenue was negligible recurring revenue of  million was up  and represented  of total revenue looking now to each of our businesses starting with moodys investors service total mis revenue for the quarter was  million up  us revenue increased  to  million nonus revenue of  million was up  and represented  of total mis revenue the impact of foreign currency translation on mis revenue was negligible moving now to the lines of business for mis first corporate finance revenue for the second quarter was  million up  this result reflected a favorable mix within each of us leveraged finance and emea investment grade issuance as well as strong growth in emea bank loan and asian bond issuance us and nonus corporate finance revenues were up  and  respectively second structured finance revenue totaled  million up  primarily driven by the continued strength of us clo issuance us structured finance revenue was up  while nonus revenue was down  third financial institutions revenue of  million was up  this result was largely driven by an increase in issuance from infrequent issuers in emea us and nonus financial institutions revenue were up  and  respectively fourth public project and infrastructure finance revenue of  million was down  this result was primarily driven by a decline in us issuance and a change in mix of european infrastructure issuance the revenue decline was partially offset by strong growth in infrastructure issuance in asia us public project and infrastructure finance revenue was down  while nonus revenue was up  finally mis other which consist of nonrating revenue from icra in india and korea investor service contributed  million to mis revenue for the second quarter down  the decline is attributable to the divestiture of a noncore subsidiary of icra in late  turning now to moodys analytics total revenue for ma of  million was up  us revenue of  million was up  nonus revenue of  million was up  and represented  of total ma revenue the impact of foreign currency translation on ma revenue was negligible and now moving to the lines of business for ma first research data and analytics or rda revenue of  million was up  and represented  of total ma revenue growth was mainly driven by strength in sales of credit research and ratings data feeds us and nonus rda revenues were up  and  respectively second enterprise risk solutions or ers revenue of  million was flat to the prior year period this result was primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition for customer projects many of which are expected to complete in the second half of the year us ers revenue was up  while nonus revenue was down  trailing month revenue and sales for ers increased  and  respectively primarily due to the  acquisition of ggy we continue to make progress on shifting the mix of the ers business to emphasize highermargin product with trailing month product sales of  and services sales declining by  third professional services revenue of  million was down  us professional services revenue was up  while nonus revenue was down  and turning now to operating expenses moodys second quarter operating expense was  million up  the increase was primarily attributable to annual salary increases higher accruals for incentive compensation and expenses related to the pending acquisition of bureau van dijk this increase was partially offset by a decline in noncompensation expense and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of  as ray mentioned moodys operating margin was  up  basis points from  in the second quarter of  adjusted operating margin was  up  basis points from  a year ago moodys effective tax rate for the quarter was  up from  in the prior year period now ill provide an update on capital allocation during the second quarter of  moodys repurchased approximately  shares at a total cost of  million or an average cost of  per share moodys also issued approximately  shares as part of its employee stockbased compensation plan moodys returned  million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the second quarter of  and on july  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of  per share of moodys common stock this dividend will be payable on september   to stockholders of record at the close of business on august   over the first half of  moodys repurchased  million shares at a total cost of  million or an average cost of  per share and issued approximately  million shares as part of its employee stockbased compensation plan moodys also returned  million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first half outstanding shares as of june   totaled  million down  from a year ago as of june   moodys had approximately  million of share repurchase authority remaining as part of moodys financing of the pending acquisition of bureau van dijk on june   moodys closed its issuance of  billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of  million of  notes due  and  million of  notes due  prior to issuing these notes moodys had an undrawn bridge loan facility the incremental financing expenses associated with these items amounted to  per share in the second quarter at quarter end moodys had  billion of outstanding debt and  billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility and undrawn term loan total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at quarter end were almost  billion with approximately  held outside the us cash flow from operations for the first half of  was negative  million a decline from a positive  million in the first half of  free cash flow for the first half of  was negative  million a decline from positive  million in the prior year period the declines in cash flow from operations and free cash flow were due to payments the company made in the first quarter  pursuant to its  settlement with the department of justice and various states attorneys general and with that ill turn the call back over to ray raymond w mcdaniel jr okay thanks linda ill conclude this mornings prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for  a complete list of moodys guidance is included in table  of our second quarter  earnings press release which can be found on the moodys investor relations website at irmoodyscom moodys outlook for  is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending mergers and acquisitions consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook our outlook assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the british pound of  to gbp and for the euro of  to eur as i noted previously this guidance does not include revenue and operating expense estimates related to our pending acquisition of bureau van dijk moodys now expects full year  diluted eps to be  to  including the ccxi gain the purchase price hedge gain and acquisition related expenses for bureau van dijk excluding these items fullyear  adjusted diluted eps is now expected to be  to  both ranges include an estimated  per share tax benefit due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for equity compensation as well as an estimated  per share impact from financing expenses related to the pending acquisition of bureau van dijk and an estimated  per share impact related to reduction in share repurchase activity as a consequence of financing the acquisition the adjusted operating margin is now expected to be approximately  moodys now expects full year  revenue to increase in the high singledigit percent range for mis full year  revenue is now expected to increase in the high singledigit percent range also us revenue is still expected to increase in the mid singledigit percent range while nonus revenue is now expected to increase in the low teens percent range corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low teens percent range financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high singledigit percent range for ma fullyear  revenue is now expected to increase in the high singledigit percent range us revenue is now expected to increase in the mid singledigit percent range and nonus revenue is now expected to increase in the low doubledigit percent range rda revenue is now expected to increase in the low doubledigit percent range before turning to qa a reminder that we continue to expect our previously announced acquisition of bureau van dijk to close in the third quarter of  as a result we are not able to provide any updates for you regarding the pending acquisition beyond what we have said in the earnings release this concludes our prepared remarks and so joining linda and me for the questionandanswer session are mark almeida president of moodys analytics and rob fauber president of moodys investors service wed be pleased to take any questions you may have questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well go first to toni kaplan from morgan stanley toni kaplan within corporate finance you had a very strong first half and youve increased guidance for the year could you give some additional color on the drivers is it just issuance related or is pricing or share gains also playing a factor there and also just which regions have been very strong it looks like the nonus business is where youre really expecting the benefit raymond w mcdaniel jr ill turn this over to rob to provide some color but you are correct we had very strong performance in the leveraged loan and spec rate portions of the market and the nonus growth was very strong as well so rob i dont know if you wanted to provide any color commentary on that robert fauber the first point there in regards to kind of the drivers of revenue growth there were a few things that played into it for this quarter first we had a very favorable mix of issuance and by this i mean that we saw very strong issuance from issuers who are typically infrequent issuers rather than issuers on relationship based arrangements with us as ray mentioned us bank loans we saw a very healthy activity there and we benefitted from issuance that was a bit more broadbased than last year where we had several kind of superjumbo transactions included in the volume so this broader issuance generally leads to better revenue yield we had very strong growth in first time mandates also contributing to that favorable mix and as ray mentioned some pockets of very strong issuance growth particularly outside the united states emea bank loans asian corporate finance canada to spotlight three toni kaplan okay great and then you raised the ma guidance to high singles from mid and basically because of the rda line and so could you just give us some color on why your confidence has increased in that business segment and so whats really driving your higher confidence for that for the rest of the year thanks mark e almeida sure this is mark were getting some benefit from the stronger pound and euro but on a constant dollar basis growth is pushing up from high singledigits to doubledigits and were seeing good underlying performance in the business with betterthanexpected yield from price new sales production and net upgrades somewhat offset by higher attrition so overall the business is firm across all of the different product areas and its just pushing us up slightly from high single to the lower end of doubledigits operator thank you and well go next to alex kramm from ubs alex kramm just maybe stepping back and asking more broadly about the guidance here obviously a great first half of the year if i look at typical seasonality i think the guidance suggests a slowdown thats usually a little bit bigger than what we would expect typically so maybe just some commentary around what is conservatism or are there actually any particular areas that make you think that some of the current run rates are not sustainable and some of this was more onetime than usual raymond w mcdaniel jr we certainly think that there has been pullforward into the first half including the second quarter how much opportunistic financing is still going to occur in the second half pulling forward from  well just have to see but borrowing conditions do remain good rates are low spreads are narrow so thats all positive also i would say in terms of the second half were cognizant of the fact that we are going to be compared against a strong second half in  and so while we think theres going to be healthy activity the comparables are more challenging in the second half alex kramm all right makes sense and then maybe just shifting gears away from earnings for a second here i wanted to ask you about bvd when you had the call and you were pointing out the strong growth that these guys had i think like  cagr or so plus i think there was a sense that a lot of that was true growth and very little pricing and i think theres an expectation that you can do more there down the line when we do our own channel checks it actually sounds like pricing has been a fairly healthy component in some cases maybe there was even a goal to like you renew or do you want to have now maybe close to like  increases from time to time again these might be oneoff conversations but the point is can you just compare and contrast what we may have heard and kind of like the sense that youll have post the call now that you maybe have spent a little bit more time raymond w mcdaniel jr yes i mean to answer generally i think the answer is the same as how we think about pricing for the rest of moodys corporation we are going to be very focused on what kind of additional value can be provided the synergies that we talked about and that any pricing that we would seek to increase would be associated with the growth in value of the product and data that were making available operator thank you and well take our next question from manav patnaik with barclays manav patnaik the first question is just around guidance i was wondering if you could maybe flesh out the benefit you had from fx both on the top line and eps linda s huber sure manav hang on just one second raymond w mcdaniel jr it was not material in the second quarter it was negligible on revenue and i think it was  on expense linda s huber and manav to anticipate if youre wondering about the full  outlook were expecting a  favorable impact on revenue growth and as ray had said a minimal slightly unfavorable impact on expense growth does that help you out raymond w mcdaniel jr thats for the full year manav patnaik yes great thats what i was looking for okay and then just broadly i guess maybe tying into the typical expense ramp that you usually give us linda it sounds like youre generally a little bit indiscernible in the second half understanding that indiscernible and so forth but what is i guess the cost control focus look like now at the company linda s huber sure manav in answering the ramp question looking at the first quarter expense run rate to the fourth quarter now were looking at a ramp of  million to  million and previously we had said  million to  million some of that is because our projects are stretching out a little bit further into the year and we do expect some hiring in some of the businesses however were keeping very close very tight handle on hiring around here and we do continue very much to focus on expense controls focus on te but particularly using caution in hiring particularly in the higher cost areas and looking to substitute where possible in other locations so we continue that focus throughout the year operator thank you and well go next to tim mchugh from william blair timothy mchugh maybe just to ask on europe i think in the past youve had somewhat of a mixed view of the opportunity there given gdp growth versus the secular trend obviously trends are very strong lately i guess found out from one of the earlier questions has your view of the importance there or the pace of growth that we could expect to see during the next few years internationally changed at all or improved at all raymond w mcdaniel jr no i think for both europe and the us we expect growth to be modest gdp growth and then debt growth to be modest but the mix of debt that is in the banking system versus the capital markets we certainly expect to continue to see this intermediation trend continue and that is the european story actually a global story but its definitely a european story as well and given the caution in europe about the pace at which they might engage in any tapering i think were going to continue to see a good market environment good market tone going forward and that is a little more optimistic than i had been at certain points in the past linda s huber tim its linda let me just interject here the issuers were hearing from a number of the investment banks that we talk to and then rob fauber may have some more granular color for you but looking at the european markets and again this is not a moodys view but rather what were hearing from the banks they are saying they are expecting the second half of  volumes to be in line with first half activity as issuance volumes pick back up after the postsummer slowdown as ray had noted the spreads in rates remained very attractive and well see what happens with the tapering in spec rate in europe the leveraged loan market remains robust but some softness crept into highyield given where we are in the calendar year as is typical with the summer issuance weakening a bit most of the refinancing expected in  may have already occurred but fundamentals are improving economic growth looks reasonable and theres the overhang of uncertainty from brexit maybe rob might want to speak a little bit more specifically about what hes seeing in mis robert fauber the only other thing i would add to that and echo ray and lindas comments weve seen very strong issuance growth there that continued through the french and uk elections lots of investor interest lots of cash to invest there and weve also seen a pickup in first time mandate activity in emea recent activity about x what we have been seeing over the last year or two so a very good indicator about firsttime issuers coming into the market and as ray said that this in the year should trend timothy mchugh okay great and can i followup on rda mark i understand kind of the metrics you gave in terms of new sales and pricing but i guess one part is can you comment on where youve seen higher attrition and secondarily the improved sales thats leading to the higher revenue growth given theres a bunch of different solutions you provide within rda can you elaborate on what parts i guess of that segment are seeing a stronger demand or stronger growth mark e almeida on the attrition point i would characterize the higher attrition as very idiosyncratic a couple of selective cases of attrition but not anything systematic either by product or customer type or geography on the positive side this strength in the business as i said earlier is really across the board were seeing good sales production and pricing power and customer upgrades and new sales production in really all of our product areas so i really cant pinpoint it to any one thing but its just betterthanexpected performance along a number of dimensions and across a number of businesses and just to be clear were seeing good solid performance and i wouldnt characterize what were seeing as a dramatic improvement in the business we expected the business to do well its doing a bit better than we expected and if i say thats pushing us into doubledigit growth and again its no one geography or product area that i can really point to operator thank you and well go next to jeff silber from bmo capital markets jeffrey silber now that it looks like down in dc were moving away from healthcare reform back to tax reform im just wondering if youre hearing any updates about the potential change in the deductibility of corporate interest expense and what the impact might be on your business raymond w mcdaniel jr i have not heard anything that is in the public discourse about the tax reform expectations and really there are just a large number of variables and until we see how the different tradeoffs are made and interact with each other its going to be difficult to predict linda s huber tim ph its linda i just also wanted to reiterate weve said this before but i just want to make sure you have it handy if it does happen that corporate tax rates move downward a  change in our estimated tax rate is equal to  to  of eps so if you want to play around with potential scenarios you can do it with that guideline jeffrey silber okay thats helpful and then actually a couple of numbers questions for you linda what share count is embedded in your guidance for the year and can you give us an update on what your expected interest expense is for the year as well thanks so much linda s huber so im not going to give you a share count for the year you can take a look at the share count that we have we have said that given that we are committed to delevering given the acquisition expense of bureau van dijk we are reducing the guidance on our share repurchases to approximately  million for both  and  and job one for moodys right now is to delever from the financing cost for bureau van dijk so you can do some math there jeff and i think you probably could come up with something that looks reasonable im sorry your second question was jeffrey silber was on interest expense linda s huber sure so in thinking about interest expense we have been running at a rate that we had viewed as pretty normal of sort of  million a year rate in  now this year that rate has kicked up because we did do some issuance of  million in the first quarter of the year and then its pretty important that everyone understands how weve handled the financing of bureau van dijk so we announced the deal youll recall on may th and at that point we had a bridge loan in place we replaced that bridge loan on june  and we returned that bridge loan with public bonds a long fiveyear bond and a long year bond the blended interest rate on those financings is  so we are going to pay with sort of a third a third a third in cash those bond proceeds and also we have commercial paper and a term loan facility if we want to use that so again youll see that the financing impact of all of that for the year is about  million or  so hopefully that will help you out in terms of thinking about what the additional financing cost will be for the year operator thank you and well go next to joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald joseph foresi i was wondering if you could give us some idea of how conservative you are on the secondhalf performance of issuance it sounded like the environment is good things are picking up outside of comps is there anything else that we should â that you are concerned about and anything kind of holding you back raymond w mcdaniel jr again as i had mentioned the pull forward that we saw into the first half of the year creates some uncertainty for the second half there is still a sizable amount of debt that can be pulled forward and conditions remain good but whether that will happen or not i think a lot of the debt that was maturing late in  has already been refinanced so wed be looking into the out years to see what might get pulled forward rob did you want to add to that robert fauber the only thing i would add kind of touching on that is just kind of the sustainability of this bank loan refinancing cycle that were in thats a question mark another question mark just an unforeseen event market volatility and i think some potential upside if we see a pickup in public finance us public finance refunding activity linda s huber let me maybe jump in here and for the completeness of the record ill get the indications that were hearing from the issuing banks for the year on investment grade yeartodate its been about  billion of investment grade issuance and for the year now the call is for investmentgrade issuance to be down  to  rates have moved a bit higher but indiscernible stable overall condition is very constructive the first half of  was on pace with record  levels but generally there may be a slowdown in the second half as rob had just talked about the ma pipeline is a bit lighter than in the previous two years so that would be another factor that weighs on our thinking about the back half of the year in highyields  billion issuance to date calling for flat to up  in high yields the markets are resilient despite concerns about stressed retailers and a bit of weakness in the energy sector underlying demand has continued to be strong but again the same comment that the pipeline is a bit lighter given the lack of ma and many of the refinancings that were scheduled have already been completed lastly leveraged loans in the us  billion to date that is up  and as rob had said we have to think about whether that will continue spreads have been tighter very strong loan refinancing and repricing activity also note  billion of clo formation yeartodate and well have to watch the pace of that as well heavy loan mutual fund inflows and very strong investor demand so you might want to take all of that into consideration in thinking about your own views for the back half of the year joseph foresi right thanks and then just on analytics can you update us on how much of the growth this quarter was maybe related to timing or some pentup demand or regulatory change it sounded like you think that the business is just pushing forward maybe to higher growth rate but i just want to see if any of that took place just given all the political changes here in the us thanks raymond w mcdaniel jr no i dont think we saw that happening in the first half of the year youre right to observe that some of the regulatory pressure on financial institutions around the world is lightening up but the demand for what we do is being driven by other interest and other requirements on the part of the banks but i dont think we saw any pull forward in activity related to regulation in any way operator thank you and well go next to peter appert from piper jaffray peter appert so linda or mark i was hoping you could give us a little bit of commentary on margin trends in the analytics business not to be greedy but im wondering why the margin performance isnt a bit better given the strength youre seeing in your higher profit businesses and also the shift in the ers why that isnt theoretically showing up in margin performance yet mark e almeida peter i think its because weve always said that in any given quarter the margin isnt going to be that â isnt going to tell you all that much about the business and i think this quarter is a very good example of that because we had light revenue in ers due to the project timing issue so we were light on the top line the expenses were what the expenses were and we did have some additional expense coming through related to the bureau van dijk transaction so again i dont think you can gain an awful lot of information from either the operating margin or the adjusted operating margin in the quarter i think more generally were continuing to make good progress on the work were doing in ers to drive higher profitability weve talked about shifting from a business that has grown a lot through delivering these low margin implementation services we are deemphasizing that work and putting a lot more emphasis on product sales that is going well and well continue on that path so we feel like were on a good trajectory with that and i think well continue to see progress over time but again any one quarter might not be consistent with the longerterm trend linda s huber and peter i probably should help mark out here a bit mark has been pretty successful and as weve talked about before as his business is more successful it does draw a bit more in terms of corporate allocations so thats part of the issue as well peter appert got it and then linda for you im wondering what your thought is on this concept of potentially moving to an adjusted eps metric in conjunction with the bureau van dijk transaction where are you on that linda s huber peter were contemplating that we cant get the cart in front of the horse here because we dont own bureau van dijk yet so we have to wait until that closing occurs which as ray said we expect to be on schedule in the third quarter all of that appears to be going fine at that point well think about that and its something were discussing right now but well have more to say about all that on the third quarter call operator thank you well go next to craig huber from huber research partners craig huber a couple of questions your guidance for structured finance for the rest of the year id be curious as to hear what your underlying thoughts are on some of the categories rmbs cmbs the other assetbacked categories how you see them maybe playing out here in the second half of the year raymond w mcdaniel jr for structured finance we expect there to be yearoveryear growth in the second half the areas that have been strong certainly i would point you to the clo business and there is still a substantial stock of potential assets to go into clos as the loan market has been so robust recently so that would continue to be a promising area ill see if rob wants to add anything further robert fauber sure ray so abs weve experienced the market a little bit of a slowdown after a very active kind of february through may but i think issuance will be supported in particular by some of these esoteric sectors like solar and handset in cmbs kind of a stronger gen id say an active rate of inquiries the pipe is id say slightly stronger than it is this time last year id note that there is some competition from alternative funding sources in the cmbs market so banks life co et cetera so it remains to be seen how many of these mortgages actually get put into the securitization market i do think theres some optimism around the cmbs market there that the second half of  will be a bit stronger as i think the view is that the market has generally worked through some of the risk retention indiscernible clo as ray said in addition to the refi activity a healthy pipeline i think were starting to see some of the sme type deals also come into that pipeline rmbs modestly stronger id say than this time last year with again a bit of a mix of different type of assets there in europe it looks like a very healthy pipeline there and i think both in clo abs and rmbs craig huber and my other main question you have a comment in your press release where you talk about financial institutions being driven in the quarter by increased issuance from frequent issuer â of infrequent issuers in europe and middle east and africa could you just talk about that what you think it offers for the rest of the year when these banks seemingly indiscernible banks are not taking on a lot more indiscernible sit on this balance sheet indiscernible you think raymond w mcdaniel jr ill take a crack at that so youre right we typically have a more relationshipbased construct with the banks that tends to lead a very steady revenue growth we saw this quarter some very robust issuances as you say from what are typically infrequent issuers the growth in all regions so a few different drivers i think at play in the us we actually saw an increase in bank loan financing activity in the managed investment sector so that was a bit new with some infrequent issuer activity in the banking and insurance in europe a continuation of the trend that we saw in the first quarter into the second quarter which i think we may continue to see throughout the rest of the year where banks are building their bail interval capital or bail interval debt to meet those indiscernible requirements we also saw some opportunistic issuance in places like sweden and the middle east so i think were going to continue to see financing activity coming out of those middle eastern financial institutions and then lastly in asia despite the fact that we had lower fig ph issuance against the prioryear quarter that revenue grows again supported by infrequent bank and also nonbank financial issuers in china and again i think we will continue to see some of that issuance activity linda s huber and craig its linda for completeness rob might want to talk a little bit more about what hes seeing in new mandates as well so if you want to go ahead with that rob robert fauber sure a good story with the first time mandates healthy leveraged finance markets are very conducive to first time issuers tapping the market in the second quarter of  we saw over  first time mandates thats up almost  from the first quarter and up i think about  over q  that growth was in all very strong in all geographies reflecting again the same comments we had about the leveraged finance markets positive investor sentiment tight spreads in asia i would also note a record â reached a record for first time mandates in the second quarter and i had noted that the emea activity was significantly elevated over what weve seen the last couple of years the only caveat to the asian first time mandates a number of those chinese first time issuers have to get regulatory approval before they can actually issue so there some of that issuance is still sitting on the sidelines but overall we expect to see i think we could see over  first time mandates in  and thats up a bit from the levels weve seen in the last couple of years which is kind of mid to higher s craig huber if i could just squeeze one in linda your  corporate tax rate guidance for the year is that adjusted for the various onetime items weve seen in the first half because it looks like youre tracking below that so far linda s huber yes but the year isnt over yet and we have to take into account the various things that are going to happen over the course of the year also we did have the ccxi situation which was favorable from a tax perspective so give us a little bit of time as we get through the rest of the year on the tax rate but for right now were comfortable there operator thank you well go next to anjaneya singh from credit suisse anjaneya singh i think you guys have touched on this stuff in other answers but i just wanted to get your thoughts on margins clearly a strong quarter in the first half and theres many things contributing to that but what are your thoughts on the sustainability of these high s margins in your guidance as we look ahead how much of this is just the mis mix and revenue flowthrough that youve talked about versus the discipline and efficiency measures that youre also focused on just any thoughts there linda s huber sure ill take a start on this and then perhaps ray might want to add some additional color margin is always a happier story for us when we have a strong revenue quarter because we are pretty thoughtful about our expenses so if we have a good top line a lot of that comes down to operating income and helps us on the margin front for the year weve guided to approximately  and of course if the revenue line turns out to move more strongly than we think for the back half of the year there is the potential that we could do better but given everything that weve set out for the back half of the year we like this  guidance for the rest of the year and weve thought about that pretty considerably ray i dont know if you have anything else youd like to add raymond w mcdaniel jr no just i mean i think everyone is aware of this but obviously if the second half of the year slows in a way that is not expected our incentive comp accruals would flex in response to that and so we do have some ability to coursecorrect depending on whats happening with the top line anjaneya singh understood thats helpful for second question on analytics could you just touch on ers the product sales growth continues to be super strong any updated views on whats sustainable or what the outlook there could be how long do you think these doubledigit rates can continue and if you could just remind us whats driving the disparity between the us and nonus growth rates in that segment mark e almeida to take the second question first the distinction between the us and nonus is really a timing phenomenon the business is â from a sales perspective the business is doing well globally so its just what were seeing on the revenue line what projects are getting completed and what revenue is getting recognized is variable by geography its not really indicative of anything fundamental about the business itself so that really â again id just emphasize that the business is performing well inside and outside the us with respect to the strong growth in product sales that is a function of a couple of things one just generally the business is doing well but also included in that very strong product sales growth on a trailing months basis is the acquired sales from ggy so you see them coming in and they are additive so thats having a positive impact on sales growth but going forward we would expect product sales to continue to grow at a doubledigit rate i mean thats how weve built the business thats how weve constructed our product strategy we see demand to support that and thats how we expect to continue to drive growth in ers is through strong sales of product again as we deemphasize the low margin implementation services business this has been a big growth driver on the top line in years past but hasnt done much for us on the margin anjaneya singh okay got it thanks so much operator thank you and well go next to bill warmington from wells fargo william warmington so you had highlighted strength in the asian highyield issuance and i was hoping you could give us some color on the opportunity for you to rate chinese domestic bonds how thats progressing raymond w mcdaniel jr sure rob probably will want to add to my comments but we did complete the realignment of our ccxi business in domestic china so that business is now eligible to rate both parts of the chinese bond market so we are looking at opportunities with ccxi and were also looking at how we may be able to provide research and ratings either from onshore or from offshore from moodys investors service really aimed at the foreign investment community as opposed to the domestic chinese community which i think really will continue to be served by ccxi william warmington okay and then one housekeeping item that wasnt clear to me so bvd is on track to close in q are you planning to update the  guidance when you close the deal or with q earnings raymond w mcdaniel jr i think we will get the deal closed we dont know when that will happen yet we expect it to be in the third quarter but we dont know specifically when that will happen and then were going to have to get organized around what our outlook is once were able to really get in and work with the bureau van dijk team so i would expect it to be the third quarter earnings call william warmington got it all right thank you very much operator thank you well go next to vincent hung from autonomous vincent hung just one question so can you talk about the mix of frequent issuers in europe versus us how many more us frequent issuers are there versus europe raymond w mcdaniel jr europe has a higher percentage of issuers on frequent issuer programs and thats really i would say less a matter of preference in europe versus the us and more a matter of the relatively larger size of the us speculative grade market which is characterized by infrequent issuers who dont find frequent issuer arrangements as attractive so i think thats really the story there operator and at this time id like to turn the call back over to ray mcdaniel raymond w mcdaniel jr okay thank you before we end the call i want to remind everyone that moodys will be hosting our next investor day in late february of  here in new york city well get more information on the investor relations website as we get closer to the event so thank you everyone for joining todays call and we look forward to speaking with you in the fall operator and this concludes moodys second quarter  earnings call as a reminder immediately following this call the company will post the mis revenue breakdown under the second quarter  earnings section of the moodys ir homepage additionally a replay of this call will be available after  pm eastern time on moodys ir website thank you and have a good day copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the copyright

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
