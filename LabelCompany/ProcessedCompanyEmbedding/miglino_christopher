everyone thanks for joining us today were excited about our operational progress of new growth initiatives along with our cost reductions our goal is to broaden our customer base and expand our product offerings while targeting more profitable relationships while our new offerings like srax reach are doing well the growth has been offset by a legacy buy side business the first quarter results did not reflect our strategic measures however as we started reducing relationships with low margin buy side businesses in q  we expect the financial benefit of our recent initiatives will be evident in q  and build in q and beyond further as discussed on the call in late march we focused on our buy side sales team efficiency to foster more growth and reduce expenses we resized the department and consolidated our operations into our la headquarters we continue expect this action to reduce  annual expenses by  million last week we reformally branded while our roots are in social media weve grown tremendously developed with this  developed with the future of advertising technology in mind srax tools amplified performance and maximizing profits for brands in the healthcare cpg automotive wellness and lifestyle verticals we believe srax better reflects the breadth and depth of our tools offer digital marketers and content owners and our omnichannel approach that integrates every aspect of the marketing experience into one platform in early may we successfully completed a financing bringing approximately  million in net proceeds to the company we now have additional working capital with which to continue to grow the business satisfy certain obligations and help our customers execute their digital media marketing needs we continue to make advancements on both sides of our business as many of you know srax serves two primary sets of customers marketers whom we refer to as the buy side and content owners whom we refer to as the sell side turning to the buy side first sraxmd continues to be a very strong growth driver in a few moments erin deruggiero who heads up the sraxmd efforts will provide us with an overview another buy side product srax social which combines the social media management solution with the power of programmatic technology and big data to grow brand audiences is growing in magnitude weve completed the ability for brands and their agencies to utilize our platform to manage all their social media needs and pay to boost their social post all in one platform on the sell side theres a few highlights for the quarter through srax app our customers grow engage with a valuable mobile audience using the product theyre able to create unique niche audience segments based on their interest for example us located audience made up of males who are aged  to  theyre able to get location data and provide push notifications to create new messaging opportunities to their audience increase brand engagement and loyalty with exclusive content and launch promotions and contents to drive engagement turning to srax reach our custom ad unit through srax reach you can buy beyond the banner as we like to say as a combined display ads with native premium advertising imagery and story content to deliver a compelling brand experience in a single unit we doubled the number of publishers that were working with our srax reach product in q in an effort to have our investors better understand all of our offerings we intend to invite one of our executives to our earnings call each quarter our first area of focus is srax md id now like to turn the call over to erin  over to erin erin is the cofounder and chief innovation officer of srax where she spearheads srax md sales and product development as you may know erin and i first began working together in  at the last company that i had started and prior to starting social reality together in  erin please go ahead erin deruggiero thanks chris as cristin stated at the beginning of the call we had some slides to accompany the conversation ill begin on slide  i wanted to give you quick background on the digital and mobile landscape as it exits today which will help to highlight why what were doing is unique and powerful ill the overview of the technology high level since a lot can get quite technical when you get all of the minute detail but if you have specific questions or would like me to elaborate on any aspect of this ill be available for the qa at the end of the call and happy to address your questions the srax md healthcare platform came to life to service a market need for true advertising automation and innovation within the digital healthcare space pharmaceutical companies are our core customers to srax md who up until very recently didnt have many options to choose from when it came to reaching their intended audience with digital and mobile advertising the real standard was if you wanted to reach a doctor you went to a very specific doctor app or journal and brought advertising there and there is limited scale and fewer opportunity to reach these physicians with a timely deployment of ads triggered by an outside event what we call an outside event this could be a diagnosis potentially relapsing patient a rejected insurance and claim just an example our conversations with our pharma brand customers further solidify that there is a big gap between what theyre trying to achieve through digital and mobile ads targeting and what they feel is a real win that they aren’t getting from existing technology and partners and what most advertising agencies and tech companies are able to deliver we set out to close that gap with the healthcare it products weve developed doctrax doctrax match dome and mosi that were built specifically to meet these needs that weren’t being addressed by agencies and ad tech companies serving healthcare professional media while consumers were being targeted and retargeted with ads across millions of websites healthcare professionals and in particular medical doctors were much harder to reach due to legal and regulatory requirements around how and where you can engage a physician we knew there was an opportunity to change the way healthcare professionals were targeted and that we could do it in a safe way while mapping the journey of the physician and showing them ads outside of traditional medically relevant content not only reaching a doctor outside of a journal but tailoring a list of sites to the specific specialty that were targeting this approach would allow us to give our pharma clients much larger share of voice with that doctor that they care about and at the same time increase the overall level of engagement and conversion rate were seeing three times the clickthrough rates on our ad serve and nonmedical environments like a wired or espn compared to the engagement rates agencies and brands typically see within medical publisher sites weve the ability to track conversions as well which means different things for different brands it could be that were tracking whether or not that doctor writes a prescription for the drug being advertised or has watched a video through the completion we have several goals in our approach to new product development first and foremost is there a real market need for this product yes our clients are asking for this so we check that box does it exist anywhere else no not yet were breaking new ground which is always exciting to sell something that no one else is delivering and we knew we needed to create a safe environment for pharmaceutical brands to advertise we have a white list of sites and apps that have gone through rigorous medlegal and regulatory reviews and have been deemed safe contentwise for pharma advertising we partner with brand safety vendors like integral ad science and doubleverify to make sure that ads will not serve outside of the proper channels second we wanted to build a database of first and thirdparty healthcare professional data which weve done over the last four years and we continue to build upon every single day we now have more than  tag users across  specialty areas we can reach on the professional side in some specialties like oncology we have  of the total oncology universe available to target with ads on a laptop desktop or mobile device some of our partnerships with thirdparty data providers is exclusive to sraxmd allowing us to tap into timely data feeds that support the deployment to ads to a physicians device within  hours of an order being placed by a professional for a particular drug or within  hours of a diagnosis lastly we wanted to focus on mobile where professionals are spending the majority of their time browsing content our crosschannel device targeting has ramped up over the last  months which allows us to engage specific physicians on their mobile phones and tablets when theyre at a practice setting of traveling for medical meetings we have products at sraxmd that are designed to reach the healthcare professional doctors nurses nurse practitioners physicians assistant or nonprescribers and we also have exciting products that target patients and caregivers for the purpose of todays call i wanted to focus on the innovation on the healthcare professional side but if you would like to learn more about the patient offerings you can visit the website at sraxmdcom our core products on the healthcare professional side include doctrax match is a highly targeted ad campaign utilized by healthcare brands pharmaceutical agencies who want to reach a certain physician specialty most of the advertising messaging we see related to doctrax comes in the form of a branded pharmaceutical ad the offers serve unbranded ads disease awareness we recruit physicians for clinical trials we advertise medical devices and continuing medical education doctrax match is a highly targeted ad campaign that will expose only a target list of physicians that a particular client or brand is interested in and weve been working on mapping the physician journey for four years now and we can also share information related to the type of content consumed by a physician by specialty which is considered highly valuable to our clients we can also share the hcp level data back to clients integrating into their own internal software systems so that there is a constant loopback of data allowing them to understand when an ad message has been viewed or clicked dome is our mobile meeting targeting product hundreds of thousands of medical meetings take place every year across  specialty areas in the united states and in europe we have the ability to serve ads into mobile devices at hotels convention centers where these meetings are taking place we can get the ad message to a certain cellular radius a wifi network for instance provided by the meeting or isolate the targeting to reach only devices belonging to known physicians in the specialty attending the meeting finally we have mosi this is a product weve been working on for several years now that has a patent filed in process and is entirely unique in the healthcare ad targeting marketplace imagine you have a physician at their office that physician just diagnosed a patient with a rare disease that they havent yet decided on a therapy for that patient who might be diagnosed with multiple myeloma or nonhodgkins lymphoma our multiplatform can ingest what we call a triggering event like a diagnosis or a rejected claim or an order placed to distribute product and we can turn around and serve an ad to the location where the triggering event took place within  hours were in market now with this product with two of the leading blockbuster oncology drugs across several specialty areas and multiple indications overall our primary differentiator adtramd is our ability to deploy highly targeted advertising to the right physician or patient at the right time within a window of time that other healthcare it companies or ad tech companies arent able to execute were really excited about the future of our business and whats next for sraxmd and now i would like to turn the call to jp for a discussion on the financials jp hannan great thanks erin now we review the first quarter of  its important to remember that some of our initiatives began a year ago and as expected are taking time to full fruition this resulted noise when compared to the first quarter of  were pleased to say next quarter we expect our improvements begin to positively impact our financial position for the first quarter of  as compared to the first quarter of  revenues were  million that compares of  million in the prior years first quarter this reflects the intentional decrease in revenue from the significant legacy lower margin customer that weve been discussing in prior quarters and this is partially offset by an increase in revenue from our sell side clients as well as continued growth in sraxmd gross profit for the quarter was  million and that compares to  million in the first quarter of last year our gross margin was  and that compares to  in the prior years first quarter this is reflective of lower revenue and lower margin profile on our buy side business first quarter  operating expenses were  million that is included  million in sga which saw the continuation of our enhanced sales initiatives from last year we were one more quarter before these yearoveryear comparisons begin to normalize there was that  restructuring charge in quarter that related to our buy side reorganization and a  writeoff for a noncompete agreement all total this compared to  million in the first quarter of  other income included lower interest expense greater amortization and a  million benefit related to the accretion of the political warrants from our issuance in january through quarter end we expect this to be partially offset by a charge related to the repurchase of those warrants that happen in conjunction with our recently announced financing in the second quarter our net loss was  million in the quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda with a loss of  million compared to adjusted ebitda loss of  in the first quarter of  as chris mentioned earlier weve been working on enhancing liquidity and we initiated a debt financing in the first quarter that then closed in the second quarter with net proceeds of approximately  million with regard to equity there are approximately  million common shares of approximately  million warrants outstanding and i would like to end by saying the quarter performed as expected and we positioned the company for growth in  we are reaffirming  guidance we continue to expect  revenue to range between  million and  million and we reiterate  adjusted ebitda guidance of between  million and  million and now with that id like to turn the call back to chris christopher miglino thanks jp and erin over the past year weve done a lot of work to improve our revenue base expand our offerings and establish a better cost structure were posed to reap the benefits starting in the second quarter last week we held our annual sales meeting and i can assure you the team is excited about all the opportunities with these new products and with that said we now like to open the call for any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions at this time well go to james mcilree with chardan capital please go ahead james mcilree thank you and good afternoon chris in your comments you said that  hi chris in your comments you said that  million in you raise is youll have will give you working capital to grow the business and satisfy certain obligations could you elaborate on what certain obligations are how much they are when theyre due and i have a couple of others after that christopher miglino sure so we had a  as many of you know there was a put right that m had on some of their warrants which was a financial instrument which had a benefit as the value of the stock went down the value of the put warrant went up and we used around  million of the money to buy that put warrant back from empree and thus theres no more incentive to drive the price of the stock down so that was one very important piece that we had to work towards getting taking care of because they actually had the right to put that back to us and if we didnt have the ability to pay them back they wouldve had the ability to take that in stock so we had to get that taken care of so we did and i think that will be a good thing for the stock and the maximum value that they were able to glean from the put value was right down in the   range or  range so they maximize the value of that put and were able to buy that back we had certain obligations that were due from just some people that we had owed some money to and continue to owe some money to so we took care of some of those  some of those obligations there was also a put right that victory park capital had some warrants that they have in the company but they have not put that warrant to us although they have the right to do that and once they do that i think we have around  to  days to pay them back that money once they put that to us so i will mention that in the financing that we just completed there is also a green shoe that is available in that financing that can come into effect after a shareholder meeting which has been put in product so we anticipate having that meeting in the next jp whats the date of that meeting if you  do know the date of the meeting jp hannan yeah it was june  christopher miglino june  so we have the ability to  those investors have the ability to put an additional  million into the company as well which we anticipate that they will do although theres no guarantee that that will happen theyve given us the indications that provided the shareholder approval there will be an additional  million that will come into the company from that james mcilree and jp the eight million shares outstanding and  million warrants that does today or at the quarter end jp hannan actually both james mcilree okay jp hannan so the shares or both the  we repurchased  warrants as part of this financing that chris just described in the second quarter so its slightly lower james mcilree okay and so are there more  after you buy the  million of the put warrants are there  is that the entire  is that the entire amount or the put warrants or are there more out there jp hannan that is the entirety of their position the warrants that have put rate features attached to it they hold every warrants because theyre just straight warrants james mcilree yeah okay great but then the  go ahead jp hannan the ability for them to put the  the ability for them to put anything to us from empree has gone away james mcilree right got it okay and the intentional reduction in the legacy customer is that going to continue in q or that all gone now christopher miglino there is some of that in q but that really started a year ago in the second quarter so youre starting  the numbers will start to normalize in the yearoveryear disparities will start to be more clean and be more apples to apples james mcilree if we look at q this year versus q last year about what is the dollar impact on that intentional reduction christopher miglino i dont have that in front of me i can definitely get back with you offline on that though james mcilree okay great thats helpful and then to hit the guidance at the low end youre talking  million for the final three quarters which is obviously a big jump from where you are now and it sounds like q doesn’t get you back to normal it gets you kind of to better than q performance i am just wondering whats the big driver if we  if you hit  million for the final three quarters thats  per quarter whats driving that big jump and i know theres a seasonality in q lets ignore that but even if we compare it to the yearoveryear comparisons its still a pretty big jump i would just like understand what youre expecting to grow that quickly jp hannan chris could cover that christopher miglino last year we didnt have a lot of revenue coming from a couple of different products there was no revenue into the second and third quarter for our reach product because were still in development social wasnt fully developed and md wasnt having the type of year that it is having now so were definitely benefiting from those and also weve put a lot of efforts while we saw a reduction in the buy side customer that we keep talking about weve done a lot of work in improving and in building up the team on the buy side so their contribution is starting to become evident so… jp hannan if i look at that number its a decline of  million is the number you were looking for and thats whats almost entirely been made up in the quarter of their new products james mcilree okay great and i think let me ask one more before i get back in line can you talk about the percent of revenues coming from buy side versus sell side this quarter versus either  versus the prior quarter and a year ago quarter jp hannan we dont generally break that out and the different product lines weve not put that in our financials james mcilree okay so let me ask it i understand that let me ask a different one then so if we looked at the buy side ex this legacy customer did the buy side grow yearoveryear again ex that legacy customer christopher miglino i think thats a number that jp would have to do a little calculating on jp hannan i dont have that level of detail in front of me right now but i think it was flat ex that one customer james mcilree okay thats great thank you and ill jump back in line operator operator instructions well take a followup from jim mcilree with chardan capital james mcilree yeah thanks again so just looking at expenses jp i was a little bit i dont want to say confuse i just want to make sure i understand what the expense profile is going forward so you talked i think you had some comment about sga one more quarter before normalizing and im just a little bit confused as to what you mean by that jp hannan midyear last year as there was a more holistic view of the buy side business the decision was made to expand the sales team and there were a number of people hired that started in the second and third quarter that they were not there a year ago and so were just comping through that expanded share of investment james mcilree okay okay so youre talking about that yearoveryear comparison normalizing so the first half of this year is a bad comparison because weve got those extra salespeople where we didnt had them last year jp hannan right james mcilree but in the second half it will be normal because theyre in both sides right jp hannan correct yes james mcilree okay okay i get it that makes sense all right great i think that does it thank you operator operator instructions that will conclude the qa session ill turn the call back over to chris for closing remarks christopher miglino thanks for joining us today were really excited about  we think we have some great opportunity some great products are coming to market and we look forward to talking to you more about that into the
