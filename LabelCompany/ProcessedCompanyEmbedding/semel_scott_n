snack barkthins features six varieties of dark chocolate slivers studded with simple ingredients congers ny — scott semel claims he created a new food category two years ago with the introduction of barkthins billed as “snacking chocolate” the brand features six varieties of dark chocolate slivers studded with simple ingredients such as dried blueberries toasted coconut chips pretzel pieces and roasted almonds containing no artificial colors or flavors barkthins are nongmo project verified fair trade certified and certified kosher the flagship line is packaged in resealable pouches with varieties that range from pumpkin seed to peppermint to blueberry quinoa crunch the products are available in whole foods market target safeway wegmans costco and other national retailers singleserving bags and seasonal flavors are slated to debut at select locations this year “we’ve put together a very aggressive sales plan for  that represents a very significant increase over  and we’ve already surpassed our goal for the year” mr semel said “we are way ahead of our plan and we’re pretty gratified that the response has been so amazing” in an interview with food business news mr semel shared the story behind the brand’s explosive growth and his thoughts on the future of the confectionery category food business news how was this concept developed scott semel i had a private label business for many years and one of the mandates of the business was to develop product bark historically has been a seasonal item as a peppermint bark in a tin or gift box during the holidays i started thinking through how to commercialize bark because it was a product that had not been commercialized so we worked pretty hard on that and getting it right for a long period of time before showing it to respective customers how did you know the product could be successfully extended yearround mr semel it was differentiated from the beginning it was always met with positive response at holiday and intuitively i said if it sells well at holiday and if it didn’t have specific holiday ingredients why couldn’t it be an everyday snack the product tastes great it has historically been seasonal what do we need to do to make it an everyday goto snack the company offers dark chocolate peppermint pretzel as a seasonal flavor how did you decide to position this product as a betterforyou option in the confectionery category mr semel when we did it it was more about what i would buy myself i was my test audience quite simply indulgent snacking with a clean label is what i wanted the idea behind thins was that bark historically has been very thick and we just wanted to make it more snackable and approachable if you can break it and eat as much or as little as you want that is a snackable element conceptually it’s simple to explain and understand i do think we were early on in thinking of chocolate as a snack and we definitely have seen some people playing off the thin aspect including oreo i think it’s a testament to us and i think it’s creating some awareness around what we’re doing what are the challenges of developing a product with a clean label mr semel the first mandate was we wanted the chocolate to be clean fair trade and nongmo and having been in the business we had a fair amount of relationships in that genre we worked really hard with a particular chocolate supplier to get the right blend specifically for us on top of that we have a team of people here who are wellversed in sourcing clean ingredients the confectionery category and the snack category for a long time have been a lot of mainstream guys selling mainstream stuff and a lot of artisan people selling highend things at a very high price point but there haven’t been a ton of people who are firmly planted in the middle who can deliver high quality ingredients and a great tasting product and make it commercially viable that was also one of the things we wanted to do from the very beginning we wanted the ingredients to be great we wanted to the product to taste great but we didn’t want it to be exclusive barkthins started with introducing recognizable ingredients in its chocolate like almonds pretzel mint and peanuts how did you develop the flavor profiles for your core range mr semel initially the thought process was people are going to buy what they know and understand for the first four we introduced we wanted to keep it as simple as we possibly could we wanted to put products on the market that people could understand so it was almonds pretzel mint and peanut to start once we got into it we saw that almond and pretzel distanced themselves from other two and then we wanted to work toward finding a range that met our product qualifications that it needs to be simple and approachable but at the same time if we can have inclusions that resonate with people like coconut almond or blueberry quinoa and we can manufacture it in an effective way let’s go about doing that going forward if we can come up with products that speak to what people like and are still differentiated that’s certainly a direction we will go this product lends itself to innovation and inclusions so you can go in a lot of different directions which is great because the platform product is based upon the ability to innovate are there other types of product lines or formats you can expand into mr semel right now the focus is what’s on our plate we have to execute against our plan having said that we do have thought processes into what the future can look like and there’s a ton of different platforms and directions we can go that are consistent with the brand but elevated in a way that further differentiates it there are definitely things in the innovation pipeline that are interesting and compelling but we’re still new and we have to be focused and direct in giving people what they want where do you see the confectionery category headed mr semel i think the trends are going toward where we’re taking it which is indulgent and clean you read about what kitkat which is as mainstream as it gets wants to do by  to have transparent ingredients and clean label the category itself is a 0 billion category and continues to grow every year there’s room for lots of people i think we have been differentiated from the standpoint that we’re marketing it as snacking chocolate so there’s an element of category creation so we want to be a little bit ahead of it but i think that the category is only going to grow and hopefully we’re at the forefront of
