liabilities by  million at their respective completion dates the company finances its earning assets with a combination of interestbearing and interestfree funds the interestbearing funds are composed of deposits shortterm borrowings and longterm debt interest paid for the use of these funds is the second factor in the net interest income equation interestfree funds such as demand deposits and stockholders equity require no interest expense and therefore contribute significantly to net interest income the profit margin or spread on invested funds is a key performance measure the company monitors two key performance indicators  net interest spread and net interest margin the net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities the net interest spread in  was  increasing from  in  the net interest margin represents the overall profit margin  net interest income as a percentage

basis points to  for the year ended december   the accretion added  thousand per month during  and will continue over the next several years the increase in net interest margin is largely a result of

sufficient to satisfy depositors requirements and meet the credit needs of customers the company depends on its ability to maintain its market share of deposits as well as acquiring new funds the companys ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends in large measure on its profitability capitalization and overall financial condition principal sources of liquidity include assets considered relatively liquid such as shortterm investment securities federal funds sold and cash and due from banks along with its liquid assets farmers has additional sources of liquidity available which help to insure that adequate funds are available as needed these other sources include but are not limited to loan repayments the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds and borrowings on approved lines of credit at two major domestic banks at december   farmers had not borrowed against these lines of credit management feels that its liquidity position is more than adequate and will continue to monitor the position on a monthly basis the company also has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb as well as access to the
