feature providing the opportunity to invest for growth up to a performance cap rate with some downside protection it offers protection from some downside risk if the negative return is in excess of the segment buffer there is risk of significant loss of principal what is structured capital strategies® structured capital strategies® is a variable and indexlinked deferred annuity contract and a longterm financial product designed for retirement purposes simply stated an annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company that lets the investor pursue the accumulation of assets through equities and other investment options an investor may then take payments or a lump sum amount at a later date how it works the structured investment option permits an investor to invest in one or more segments each of which provides performance tied to the performance of a securities or commodities index for a set period  or  years up to a performance cap rate once a suitable index is selected its tracked in the structured investment option sio  an an investor will then have the ability to choose the segment duration and a segment buffer the segment buffer  the builtin protection feature in which axa equitable will absorb up to the first   or  of any loss an investor will absorb the loss in excess of their segment buffer an investor is protected from some downside risk if the negative return is in excess of the segment buffer there is risk of significant loss of principalsegment duration  the segment start date to segment maturity date available in one three and five yearsthe segment type  the combination of the index option duration and buffer chosen is what distinguishes the available investment optionschoice segment  generally have higher performance cap rates  and thus greater potential segment performance than corresponding standard segments while also offering buffer protection levels of      generally falling on the th of the month the segment is established keep in mind once money is invested in a segment an investor cannot transfer from the segment into another investment option until segment maturity the segment start date is also the same day the segment’s performance cap rate is set by axa the performance cap rate is the ceiling on the segment’s rate of return for example if the index rate of return is  and the performance cap rate is  the actual segment rate of return would be  because the performance cap rate will not be known until money is transferred into a segment which means an investor will not know in advance the upper limit on the return the investor may set a performance cap threshold simply stated the performance cap threshold is the minimum cap required of a segment before investing in it if the performance cap threshold is higher than the segment’s performance cap rate money will continue to be held in the segment type holding account until it is met or the entire account value is transferred out of the segment type holding account the performance cap rate threshold remains in effect for  scheduled start date opportunities if at the end of the rd opportunity the requested threshold is not met any money in the segment holding account will be swept on the next segment start date that the segments become available for contracts issued on or after august th  a performance cap threshold will remain in effect until after the third scheduled segment start date following the performance cap threshold election for policies issued prior to august th  the performance cap threshold is active for  days or if later until amounts are swept into a new segment setting a performance cap threshold is not required  there is a risk of a substantial loss of principal because an investor agrees to absorb all losses to the extent they exceed the protection provided by the structured investment option at maturity if an investor would like guarantee of principal we offer other products that provide such guarantees when a segment matures an investor has the following options available on the date of maturity transfer to the same segment type the maturity value can be transferred to the holding account of the same segment type for investment into the next available segment if no action is taken by the investor this option is the default transfer to a new segment type the maturity value can be transferred into the holding accounts of a different segment types chosen by the investor for investment on the segment start date transfer to the variable investment options the maturity value can be transferred into the variable investment options of the investors choice at maturity the segment maturity value is calculated using the segment rate of return which is based on the index’s performance rate of return adjusted by the segment buffer or performance cap rate keep in mind the segment performance is not an annual rate of return but is measured from the day invested to the day the segment matures it is important to know that an investor may lose principal if a negative return is in excess of the segment buffer at any time an investor may have the option to withdraw their money withdrawals may be subject to contractual withdrawal charges normal income tax treatment may be subject to an additional  federal income tax penalty and subject to a segment interim value please refer to the prospectus for more detailed information on the segment interim value the segment interim value is the value of an investment prior to the segment maturity date the segment interim value may be
