need my books bio  short versionlori is the author of gates of thread and stone and the infinite she has a borderline obsessive fascination with unicorns is fond of talking in capslock and loves to write about magic manipulation and family she lives in wisconsin with her husband kids and a friendly pitbulllong versionlori was born in the mountains of laos where her family relocated to a thailand refugee camp for a few years and then moved permanently to the united states when she was three she can’t remember any of it and uses this excuse to insist she was raised by invisible flying unicorns like thestrals but less morbid she’s been writing since the third grade although quality has hopefully improved her first novel was a mary sue fantasy romance she wrote when she was a preteen it contained many things preteens probably should not have been writing about she blames her older sisters other random or otherwise things about lori • she doesn’t know her real birth date her legal one was given to her in the refugee camp apparently the mountain villages don’t keep birth records this means she is allowed to lie about her age cheers • she has two older sisters who embody the words fierce and fabulous • she is married to a social worker who fancies himself a comedian she has no idea how this happened • she has a degree in creative writing • she loves unicorns in the zombies vs unicorns debate unicorns obviously prevail • her favorite category to read and write is young adult some might tell you it’s because she is mentally ten but do not listen to them ten is obviously middle grade if anything she’s mentally fifteen • she has dreamed about being an author since she was eight ♥ posted  comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments

this i hope i can reply with as much style and wit as scott lynch does here when he answers a reader who complains spelling his about the black female pirate in lynchs fantasy pirate novels real sea pirates could not be controlled by women they were vicous rapits and murderers and i am sorry to say it was a man’s world it is unrealistic wish fulfilment for you and your readers to have so many female pirates ok lets leave aside for the moment that nothing is unrealistic or impossible in a fantasy novel whose worldbuilding is thorough lets also leave aside the sheer level of fantastic in lynchs reply including shit yes zamira drakasha leaping across the gap between burning ships with twin sabers in hand to kick in some fucking heads and sail off into the sunset with her toddlers in her arms and a hold full of plundered goods is a wishfulfillment fantasy from hell i offer her up on a silver platter with a fucking bow on top i hope she amuses and delights in my fictional world opportunities for buttkicking do not cease merely because one isn’t a beautiful teenager or a musclewrapped font of testosterone my fictional universe    includes “sbf  nonsmoker  children buccaneer of no fixed abode seeks unescorted merchant for light boarding heavy plunder” leaving all that aside for a moment lets go to real sea pirates could not be controlled by women they were vicous rapits and murderers and i am sorry to say it was a man’s world i wont argue about the criminal records and probable temperament of many historical pirates and i wont argue that it was a mans world but really no real sea pirates were ever controlled by a woman i wonder what madame ching had to say about that shes regarded as possibly the most successful pirate commander of all time with thousands bowing to her rule the only way china got her out of their hair was to offer her a luxurious retirement and widespread pardons and of course anne bonny mary read and grania omalley would also beg to differ with this singular assessment of ladies on the high seas of course dear reader with his hamfisted spelling would probably flutter his soft little hands and protest that such women are outliers that overall its still unrealistic wish fulfillment to write about female pirates because overall they werent the norm well so the fuck what dont we write fiction about what is outlying what is extraordinary what bucks the trendbecause its more interesting that the norm because it makes a better story besides which you chinless commasplicing ferret it was a fantasy novel to read the whole
