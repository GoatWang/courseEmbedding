review  rating  pcmagcom subscribe reviews software small business  accounting  tax kathy yakal patriot software full service payroll patriot software full service payroll does an exceptional job of supporting its customers but it lacks some important features and its interface lags behind those of the best services patriot software full service payroll by kathy yakal march   pm est march   editors rating good view gallery view all  photos in gallery msrp  pros free live setup assistance excellent online guide to state employer setup good framework for records and tasks integrated basic accounting free email phone and chat support cons lacks online setup wizard weak dashboard cant pay contractors  software costs extra no payroll total after processing no mobile apps bottom line patriot software full service payroll does an exceptional job of supporting its customers but it lacks some important features and its interface lags behind those of the best services small businesses that choose to manage their own payroll typically need a lot of support especially during setup patriot software full service payroll challenges even such competitors such as editors choice gusto when it comes to providing help to its customers and its nofrills user interface handles creating employee records defining deductions and contributions and processing a payroll run at  per month for the first employee and  per month for additional employees full service payrolls cost can add up however this would be fine if it stood above its competition in ways other than support but it doesnt compare similar products compare gusto   paychex flex   surepayroll   intuit enhanced payroll   sage payroll essentials   prep work patriot softwares exceptional customer service options which include free chat email and phone support are immediately apparent like some of its competitors patriots payroll service makes its experts available to complete this onerous task for you if you prefer its possible to set up employees on your own but i would recommend that you let the company help you if youve never done a payroll for two reasons first the software doesnt include a setup wizard to walk you through doing it yourself youll have to figure out which navigation links to visit in order to complete the groundwork for your payroll runs second payroll is the most complex part of small business accounting and it requires absolute precision and timeliness you not only have to get employee compensation exactly right but youll also be making payments to benefits providers and other agencies if your employees have multiple deductions thats a lot of coordinating to do id definitely recommend letting patriot help you get it set up right view all  photos in gallery note that in addition to its full service payroll service patriot also offers basic payroll for  for the first employee with additional costs for more employees if you opt to go this route however youll need to file your own payroll taxes which may be more work than the savings is worth note that even if you pay the higher fee the full service in this services name doesnt apply to paying contractors as  software costs extra this is a significant omission  navigation tools the website for full service payroll is laid out like those of many of its competitors a vertical pane on the left contains your primary navigation links when youve clicked on one the center of the screen displays the tools needed to complete that task click on the payroll bar at the top of the menu or the dashboard link in the horizontal toolbar at the top and your dashboard home page opens this is divided into two vertical panes one contains links to recent payroll runs tax collections and tax deposits the other displays links to things you might want to do finish a payroll add an employee and so on as well as to popular help articles surepayroll and other competitiors populate their dashboards with more data and links however because youll spend so much time in the dashboard this mediocre dashboard is a weakness of patriot softwares payroll service the left navigation pane divides its task and data links into employees payroll tasks time  attendance tasks human resource tasks reports settings and training you click on the plus or minus signs to the right of these labels to expand or collapse the subitems once youve clicked on a link the working screens themselves are intuitive they use standard online dataentry conventions basically you fill in blanks or click links or select from dropdown lists sometimes there are directional arrows marked next step to guide you as on the pay employees screen again this is the way most online payroll sites work but others most notably gusto are more graphically interesting and aesthetically pleasing gusto has managed to tuck away much of the sites functionality so that the overall look is spare but comprehensive which makes it easier to use setting up settings when youre getting started you mostly work with the settings menu the first submenu payroll settings contains links to the screens on which you build the framework for your payroll operations patriot software is quite flexible when it comes to letting you create items for both the hours employees can work holiday regular and doubletime and the types of pay they can receive bonus commission and expense reimbursement these will of course appear as options when you start processing paychecks if you offer your employees benefits like health insurance and retirement plans you can set these up so that they can be assigned to employees when you create their records information about both companylevel deductions and companypaid contributions is entered the same way though their data fields are slightly different to create a deduction for your k for example you select the type from a dropdown list write a description to be displayed on reports and paychecks and enter the default dollar amount to be subtracted from paychecks this can either be a percentage or a flat dollar amount if its different for each employee you leave it blank you can also enter any limits required and specify the correct w box if needed and the activeinactive status more settings next up are company tax settings and state unemployment rates patriot software has assembled an excellent page with links to statespecific information that you can consult if you dont have those numbers it also tells you how to apply for a federal employer identification number ein and meet any state registration requirements and it provides links to forms that new employees must complete and that you must file you also have to supply bank account information for payroll withdrawals fill out an authorization form and enter your paycheck printing or direct deposit settings youre not finished yet if you want your employees to be able to log into passwordprotected portals on which they can view paystubs and other personal payroll information you have to create user names and temporary passwords for each staff member and send invitations to the employees this is why patriot software and competitors like surepayroll offer to help new users through the setup process its complicated and it all has to be completed before you can run your first payroll though i was allowed to complete a payroll without adding tax or bank account information the site warns you if you try to start processing a payroll without completing all of the steps but it would be really helpful if there were some kind of wizard or checklist that laid out all of the steps required such as the excellent one that intuit enhanced payroll offers personal information once your company payroll settings are completed you can create a record for each employee this is a simple process but a timeintensive one you fill in blank fields for information that hasnt been introduced yet name address ssn hire date and so on and select from lists of the options you just created such as pay type and frequency when youve supplied all of the data requested you can access individual records from one screen by clicking on tabs that open different sections of the record pay information paycheck history deductions and contributions this is an effective way to make all of these details available no one does it much better really though some of the sites make more economical use of screen space and emphasize the screens looks as well as their content gusto manages to display employee records on one page with a lot of links so either you scroll a lot or you click a lot time for payday setup is by far the most challenging element of processing payroll youll probably need to go back into these screens occasionally to make changes but patriot software makes that process simple with its add and edit and delete buttons you click on the run a new payroll entry in the left navigation pane to get ready for payday to define your payperiod start and end dates and your pay date you click on the calendars next to the blank data fields at the top of the screen that appears a list of your hourly employees is displayed below those boxes each line contains boxes for standard pay types regular overtime as well as the individuals hourly rate you just enter the number of hours in the correct boxes and click on the dropdown arrow in the box under additional hours and money if you need to enter hours for things such as vacation time and bonuses the same goes for your salaried staff except you dont enter hours of course when you click on the next step arrow youll see a list of employees with their gross pay and net pay in summary view details takes you to each employees paystub which is easy to understand the middle section of the screen showing totals for deductions contributions and taxes is not as clear your total tax debit appears clearly at both the top and bottom of the page but you have to hunt for the net pay number on both the summary and detail view what payroll managers want—and what other sites like gusto provide—is one clearly visible total the amount that will come out of the bank account on the specified date before you approve payroll your only options here are to approve or cancel the payroll or return to the first step after youve approved a payroll the screen that appears has no numbers on it just links to new screens that contain basically the same data youve already seen at the bottom of the final linked page you see totals for payroll taxes and for compensation but again no total thats a problem the sum total patriot software full service payroll includes many preformatted reports—more than gusto in fact—but i wish some were consolidated and others were formatted in a more standard fashion still the compiled information is there as for mobile access there are no dedicated apps though the company says it is working on optimizing the site for eventual remote access the site does have one attribute thats unique in this group it can be integrated with patriot softwares basic cashbasis accounting application for  per month which includes bill paying invoicing and contractor payments if you have a very simple business id recommend taking advantage of the free trials available but if you want the best user experience combined with the overall best set of commonly used payroll features gusto is the smart choice today pcmag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page these commissions do not affect how we test rate or

gallery msrp  pros free live setup assistance excellent online guide to state employer setup good framework for records and tasks integrated basic accounting free email phone and chat support cons lacks online setup wizard weak dashboard cant pay contractors  software costs extra no payroll total after processing no mobile apps bottom line patriot software full service payroll does an exceptional job of supporting its customers but it lacks some important features and its interface lags behind those of the best services small businesses that choose to manage their own payroll typically need a lot of support especially during setup patriot software full service payroll challenges even such competitors such as editors choice gusto when it comes to providing help to its customers and its nofrills user interface handles creating employee records defining deductions and contributions and processing a payroll run at  per month for the first employee and  per month for additional employees full service payrolls cost can add up however this would be fine if it stood above its competition in ways other than support but it doesnt compare similar products compare gusto   paychex flex   surepayroll   intuit enhanced payroll   sage payroll essentials   prep work patriot softwares exceptional customer service options which include free chat email and phone support are immediately apparent like some of its competitors patriots payroll service makes its experts available to complete this onerous task for you if you prefer its possible to set up employees on your own but i would recommend that you let the company help you if youve never done a payroll for two reasons first the software doesnt include a setup wizard to walk you through doing it yourself youll have to figure out which navigation links to visit in order to complete the groundwork for your payroll runs second payroll is the most complex part of small business accounting and it requires absolute precision and timeliness you not only have to get employee compensation exactly right but youll also be making payments to benefits providers and other agencies if your employees have multiple deductions thats a lot of coordinating to do id definitely recommend letting patriot help you get it set up right view all  photos in gallery note that in addition to its full service payroll service patriot also offers basic payroll for  for the first employee with additional costs for more employees if you opt to go this route however youll need to file your own payroll taxes which may be more work than the savings is worth note that even if you pay the higher fee the full service in this services name doesnt apply to paying contractors as  software costs extra this is a significant omission  navigation tools the website for full service payroll is laid out like those of many of its competitors a vertical pane on the left contains your primary navigation links when youve clicked on one the center of the screen displays the tools needed to complete that task click on the payroll bar at the top of the menu or the dashboard link in the horizontal toolbar at the top and your dashboard home page opens this is divided into two vertical panes one contains links to recent payroll runs tax collections and tax deposits the other displays links to things you might want to do finish a payroll add an employee and so on as well as to popular help articles surepayroll and other competitiors populate their dashboards with more data and links however because youll spend so much time in the dashboard this mediocre dashboard is a weakness of patriot softwares payroll service the left navigation pane divides its task and data links into employees payroll tasks time  attendance tasks human resource tasks reports settings and training you click on the plus or minus signs to the right of these labels to expand or collapse the subitems once youve clicked on a link the working screens themselves are intuitive they use standard online dataentry conventions basically you fill in blanks or click links or select from dropdown lists sometimes there are directional arrows marked next step to guide you as on the pay employees screen again this is the way most online payroll sites work but others most notably gusto are more graphically interesting and aesthetically pleasing gusto has managed to tuck away much of the sites functionality so that the overall look is spare but comprehensive which makes it easier to use setting up settings when youre getting started you mostly work with the settings menu the first submenu payroll settings contains links to the screens on which you build the framework for your payroll operations patriot software is quite flexible when it comes to letting you create items for both the hours employees can work holiday regular and doubletime and the types of pay they can receive bonus commission and expense reimbursement these will of course appear as options when you start processing paychecks if you offer your employees benefits like health insurance and retirement plans you can set these up so that they can be assigned to employees when you create their records information about both companylevel deductions and companypaid contributions is entered the same way though their data fields are slightly different to create a deduction for your k for example you select the type from a dropdown list write a description to be displayed on reports and paychecks and enter the default dollar amount to be subtracted from paychecks this can either be a percentage or a flat dollar amount if its different for each employee you leave it blank you can also enter any limits required and specify the correct w box if needed and the activeinactive status more settings next up are company tax settings and state unemployment rates patriot software has assembled an excellent page with links to statespecific information that you can consult if you dont have those numbers it also tells you how to apply for a federal employer identification number ein and meet any state registration requirements and it provides links to forms that new employees must complete and that you must file you also have to supply bank account information for payroll withdrawals fill out an authorization form and enter your paycheck printing or direct deposit settings youre not finished yet if you want your employees to be able to log into passwordprotected portals on which they can view paystubs and other personal payroll information you have to create user names and temporary passwords for each staff member and send invitations to the employees this is why patriot software and competitors like surepayroll offer to help new users through the setup process its complicated and it all has to be completed before you can run your first payroll though i was allowed to complete a payroll without adding tax or bank account information the site warns you if you try to start processing a payroll without completing all of the steps but it would be really helpful if there were some kind of wizard or checklist that laid out all of the steps required such as the excellent one that intuit enhanced payroll offers personal information once your company payroll settings are completed you can create a record for each employee this is a simple process but a timeintensive one you fill in blank fields for information that hasnt been introduced yet name address ssn hire date and so on and select from lists of the options you just created such as pay type and frequency when youve supplied all of the data requested you can access individual records from one screen by clicking on tabs that open different sections of the record pay information paycheck history deductions and contributions this is an effective way to make all of these details available no one does it much better really though some of the sites make more economical use of screen space and emphasize the screens looks as well as their content gusto manages to display employee records on one page with a lot of links so either you scroll a lot or you click a lot time for payday setup is by far the most challenging element of processing payroll youll probably need to go back into these screens occasionally to make changes but patriot software makes that process simple with its add and edit and delete buttons you click on the run a new payroll entry in the left navigation pane to get ready for payday to define your payperiod start and end dates and your pay date you click on the calendars next to the blank data fields at the top of the screen that appears a list of your hourly employees is displayed below those boxes each line contains boxes for standard pay types regular overtime as well as the individuals hourly rate you just enter the number of hours in the correct boxes and click on the dropdown arrow in the box under additional hours and money if you need to enter hours for things such as vacation time and bonuses the same goes for your salaried staff except you dont enter hours of course when you click on the next step arrow youll see a list of employees with their gross pay and net pay in summary view details takes you to each employees paystub which is easy to understand the middle section of the screen showing totals for deductions contributions and taxes is not as clear your total tax debit appears clearly at both the top and bottom of the page but you have to hunt for the net pay number on both the summary and detail view what payroll managers want—and what other sites like gusto provide—is one clearly visible total the amount that will come out of the bank account on the specified date before you approve payroll your only options here are to approve or cancel the payroll or return to the first step after youve approved a payroll the screen that appears has no numbers on it just links to new screens that contain basically the same data youve already seen at the bottom of the final linked page you see totals for payroll taxes and for compensation but again no total thats a problem the sum total patriot software full service payroll includes many preformatted reports—more than gusto in fact—but i wish some were consolidated and others were formatted in a more standard fashion still the compiled information is there as for mobile access there are no dedicated apps though the company says it is working on optimizing the site for eventual remote access the site does have one attribute thats unique in this group it can be integrated with patriot softwares basic cashbasis accounting application for  per month which includes bill paying invoicing and contractor payments if you have a very simple business id recommend taking advantage of the free trials available but if you want the best user experience combined with the overall best set of commonly used payroll features gusto is

and news how to price a productby amanda cameron on march   product pricing can make or break your small business if you set prices higher than what customers will spend you lose sales but if you set prices too low you don’t earn at your highest potential price points need to meet somewhere in the middle to generate the most revenue do you know how to price a product for your small business there is no simple formula for getting prices right however you can use different strategies to find prices that satisfy you and your customers’ needs research your market conducting a market analysis on your customers and competition can help you find out what your customers are willing to pay customers understanding your customers is essential to product pricing conduct interviews surveys or focus groups to find out your target customers’ needs you can also look at industryspecific statistics look for trends in the places that your target customers spend money and how much they spend competition be aware of how other companies in your industry price products you don’t need to set your prices lower than your competitors racing to set the cheapest prices could push your revenue below your bottom line instead market your products as valuable and worth their costs how to price a product use your market analysis to decide what your customers are willing to pay you will also want to consider the costs of running your business look at your gross margin to decide your bottom line for pricing for how to price a product try one or more of the following strategies price segmentation price segmentation is not a onesizefitsall product pricing method instead you address the needs of smaller more specific groups within your market separate the groups by the amount customers will pay for your products offer discounts to the groups that tend to pay less offering different prices for the same product allows you to cover more ground in your market you include lowspending customers without lowering all your prices for example a coffee shop next to a college might have market groups that show the lower paying customers are students the owner offers a student discount deal on coffee and bagels the discount allows the coffee shop to serve students without lowering all the prices tiered pricing with tiered pricing you give all customers different price options for the same product each option includes more features than the one beneath it this method addresses customers with different levels of needs and budgets for an example of pricing your products at different levels you might include basic upgraded and superior the majority of customers are in the middle spending range but the expensive option is available for those willing to spend more for extra features the expensive option is not just for reaching the occasional high spender it also exists to motivate the majority midrange spending customers average spenders are more willing to buy a midpriced item when it is placed next to a more expensive option the midpriced item looks like a valuable product and a deal bundle packages when you bundle you sell packages for less than the total of each individual product’s price bundling can get customers to buy more products than they initially intended for example if you own a furniture store you could bundle a couch and a chair the package deal would be less expensive than if you charged the couch and chair separately if a customer only wanted a couch the bundled price might persuade them to buy more to take advantage of the deal this product pricing method helps you sell larger amounts of inventory while only incurring onetime marketing costs if you need to get rid of old inventory quickly you may want to create some bundle deals most significant digit pricing for this method of how to price a product you lower prices slightly to make the most significant digit smaller this works because many customers pay more attention to the most significant digit this digit is the one furthest to the left on a price think of selling an item for  instead of  most people will focus on the furthest left digits meaning the one and the two respectively one is smaller than two so  seems cheaper though there’s only a five cent difference  might seem less expensive to some customers do you need a simple way to track your

the topperforming hr software products frontrunners quadrants highlight the top software products for north american small businesses all products in the quadrant are top performers small businesses can use frontrunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them to create this quadrant we evaluated over  human resource information system hris products those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant scores are based largely on reviews from real software users along with other product performance details eg what features they offer how many customers they have is one quadrant better than the others nope products in any quadrant may fit your needs every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability how much the products can do and value whether they’re worth their pricecost that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success frontrunners has four subquadrants upper right  leaders leaders are allaround strong products they offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers these products are considered highly valuable by customers   upper left  masters masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than leaders do if you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles then a product in the masters quadrant might be right for you   lower right  pacesetters pacesetters may offer a strong set of features but are not rated as highly on value for example a pacesetter might offer greater functionality but cost more   lower left  contenders contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point this makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs depending on the specific needs of a software buyer a product in any of these subquadrants could be a good fit why to even be considered for this frontrunners a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of  for both capability and value this means that all products that qualify as frontrunners are topperforming products in their market they appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed for some buyers a specific frontrunners subquadrant might be best for example buyers wanting a core system with a strong focus on personnel tracking and workforce management capabilities might consider software in the contenders subquadrant while those looking for a more comprehensive platform with features like performance management and applicant tracking might look in the leaders subquadrant you can download the full frontrunners for hris management report it contains individual scorecards for each product on the frontrunners quadrant how are frontrunners products selected products are scored based on user reviews and other data you can find the full frontrunners methodology here but the gist is that products are scored in two areas capability and value to be considered at all products must have at least  reviews and meet minimum user rating scores they also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example to be considered for frontrunners hris products must offer personnel tracking benefits administration and reporting capabilities from there user reviews and other product performance details such as the products

help organizations manage every aspect of their hr operations including sourcing recruiting applicant tracking personnel tracking onboarding time and attendance payroll performance reviews learning management we created this guide to help you determine which hr applications are best for your organization here’s what we’ll cover what is human resources softwareoverview of hr applicationscommon features of hr softwarewhat type of buyer are youmarket trends to understandrecent events you should know about what is human resources software human resources hr software solutions make managing a large or growing workforce more efficient vendors and buyers alike often refer to this category of software as human resources information systems hris human resources management systems hrms or human capital management hcm software though if you want to get specific each of those categories has its own nuances what all hr solutions have in common is their ability to streamline the traditional hr functions of benefits administration personnel tracking and payroll but in addition to increasing your productivity by automating many of these administrative processes hr software can also support you on a strategic level by helping you to recruit develop and manage your company’s most valuable resource its people overview of hr applications  industry watchers break down the field of hr software into three main categories core hr workforce management and strategic hr—also called talent management or talent administration software core hr encompasses the three traditional human resources management functions benefits administration personnel tracking and payroll every company will require these functions once it has reached a critical mass of employees you need core hr functionality when for instance manually running payroll and managing employees with spreadsheets becomes too burdensome a task workforce management or workforce administration as it is also called comprises the range of software solutions intended to effectively schedule and track your workforce these solutions are ideal for organizations whose employees work in shifts and include applications to track time and attendance monitor compliance with labor laws and usually include payroll functionality or integrate well with other payroll software its important to note that there are industryspecific systems that offer attendance functionality outside of human resources software specifically school administration software provides education organizations a means of tracking student attendance this can include providing online portals for parents and teachers to monitor attendance online strategic hr involves growing your company by attracting and developing the best people as well as better managing your workforce overall strategic hr applications generally provide some combination of applicant tracking and recruiting learning management as well as performance review functionality this type of software streamlines these strategic processes to ensure that a company is using its staff as efficiently as possible and also that employees are continuing to grow and develop—increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates of course core hr workforce management and strategic hr functions often overlap while there are bestofbreed solutions for individual functions in each category there are also integrated suites boasting acrosstheboard functionality common features of hr software core hr benefits administration manages employee benefits such as paid time off medicaldentallife insurance policies and k participation example vendors omniprisehrm epicor hr triton hr personnel tracking centralizes employee data such as ssn contact information past employment and demographic information example vendors sage hrms ascentis lawson hr payroll tracks employee salaries bonuses k contributions health and other deductions calculates withholding for taxes and cuts paychecks most solutions provide integration for direct deposit as well example vendors halogen vista hrms tribe hr workforce management time  attendance helps staff track employee attendance and absences and enables employees to clock in and out many solutions also track pto and sick days rulesbased engines provide alerts when employees miss or perform established amounts of work example vendors timeforge labor management laborview kronos employee scheduling provides functionality for scheduling employee shifts and attendance to ensure compliance with staffing needs systems can schedule employees across departments locations and projects and provide alerts to employees when schedules change and when staffing levels are inadequate example vendors ascentis sage hrms ultipro strategic hr applicant tracking systems ats provides a centralized database that lets recruiters store applicant information and employment applications throughout the application process features include candidate tracking applicant status monitoring and direct integration with other hr applications in addition many vendors include onboarding features like the ability to perform background checks example vendors icims marketrate nuviewhr employee evaluation also known as performance review software these applications offer a centralized system where supervisors can conduct and track reviews with employees features performance measuring tracking and goal management example vendors empower by eci cornerstone csb peopletrak learning  development establishes a centralized hub to monitor new employee training and the ongoing skills development of existing employees features include content authoring and management curriculum and certification path definition testing and reporting example vendors prosperity lms halogen talent management suite smartteam what type of buyer are you given the wide variety of popular hr software available the task of choosing one solution is daunting to help you narrow the field below we present four common buyer goals one or more of these goals might align with your needs streamline hr administrative tasks if you’re a small to mediumsized company with no hr software or you are using a few standalone solutions that you want to consolidate you should consider an integrated hr suite this will automate your more basic hr functions with a single system representative vendors sage hrms sap  hr vista hrms boost efficiency when recruiting and hiring candidates if you need to scale your workforce quickly a bestofbreed recruiting and applicant tracking solution might be your best option many of these solutions can automatically post jobs to job boards and social media outlets in addition to simplifying candidate

company and continue to do great work the broad category of talent management solutions help you do that with everything from performance appraisal solutions to systems for gathering peer feedback to employee training tools benefits include increased retention rates higher morale and greater employee productivity representative vendors halogen talent management suite kenexax nuview hr market trends to understand as you evaluate a human resources management system it is helpful to understand a few current trends in this industry consolidation of cloudbased hr software startup vendors recently there has been a trend in the hr software world toward consolidating as many applications as possible under one vendor as such companies have focused on developing integrated suites that allow hr departments to track an employee’s entire life cycle within an organization to that end many bestofbreed providers have been acquired by larger vendors looking to extend the breadth of their integrated suite solutions for instance in  sap acquired successfactors oracle bought taleo one of successfactors’ competitors and salesforcecom completed its integration of rypple a social performance platform for buyers this offers the opportunity to benefit from larger corporate resources but it can also lead to disruptions as acquired companies are integrated and product offerings are rationalized in anticipation buyers should lock in rates and servicemaintenance terms in their contract as this can save them a headache down the line adoption of software as a service hr software vendors have widely embraced the softwareasaservice saas or “webbased” deployment method saas applications are easily implemented and updated and can be accessed by hr staff and employees from almost any device with an internet connection although most saas applications allow for some level of customization it is important to realize that customization options to support your company’s unique needs can be somewhat limited vendors such as timeforce allow employees to request timeoff through their webbased system consumerization of hr software technology a major shift in the development of enterprise software has been the emergence of consumer markets as a primary source of technology innovation—a trend called consumerization from social media as a recruiting tool to mobile apps for managing hr on the go consumer technologies are changing the way hr technology is being used vendors are beefing up collaborative capabilities in their systems and developing more intuitive user interfaces when selecting the human resources system that’s best for you thirdparty reviews of product features are a great way to distinguish which vendors will deliver vendors such as bullhorn feature mobile accessibility recent events you should know about sage announces stake in fairsail in may  sage announced a minority investment of £ million in fairsail a cloudbased hr software vendor

mike kappel on may   in entrepreneur marketing startup marketing can be incredibly expensive in fact for many startups after initial investment and any payroll obligations marketing campaigns can easily be the most expensive part of your business if you’re a rookie entrepreneur heck even if you’re a veteran entrepreneur you may feel enticed to blast news and advertisements about your new company and its products through every marketing channel you can across every demographic available and when someone asks you why you’re advertising so broadly — citing concepts like marketing segmentation customer profiles and cost of conversion coc — you might be inclined to respond with “it’s okay we’re building brand awareness” if this is you i’m sorry to tell you but the term “building awareness” wasn’t meant to be the catchall justification of wasteful marketing spending a brand awareness strategy has just as many tactical elements as any marketing segmentation strategy don’t “spray and pray” there are so many ways to get out news about your new business these days that instead of picking the best fit for your product or service choosing “all of the above” can sure makes things easier  unfortunately it can also really make things expensive if you’re trying to convert potential customers into actual customers using the fewest marketing dollars possible then you should be focusing on building a profile of who your customer is where they shop what motivates them what marketing channels reach them and when they consume media you can advertise in don’t be afraid to conduct a market analysis even an informal one to gain more insight the more of these questions you can answer the more precise you can be with your advertising and the fewer advertising mediums where you’ll need to purchase ad space sure expenses of a business include marketing and advertising but why spray marketing money all over creation when you can spend it to reach your best potential customers you might also consider the chamber of commerce membership benefits for small business locally targeted marketing opportunities and resources are a great way to increase your reach without breaking the bank when building brand awareness makes cents during my time as a ceo i’ve been told that the number of “touches” or interactions required for a potential customer to even consider incorporating your product into their life is somewhere between  and  now whether that number was the product of legitimate research on consumers or a marketer selling “touches” is hard to say but what’s easy to see is that it takes a lot of advertising to reach those touch numbers awareness building is a natural byproduct of many advertising campaigns but it can also be something you strategically leverage an example of this is advertising before your prime selling season comes up for example here at patriot software we know that december and january are our prime selling months for our accounting and payroll software because many small business owners are thinking about yearend closing procedures in accounting and better methods for how to do payroll with minimum cost however if we started running our ads during that time frame alone many small business owners might be unsure about who we are since they would have never heard of us before by advertising in advance we ensure that we’re a familiar name when they enter that point in the year when they’re thinking about switching to or trying out a product like ours it’s the old “hey i know them i should try that” technique consultants and agencies know to that you need to properly position yourself before launching any campaigns for building your business simply put when you build brand awareness before a more segmented and focused marketing campaign you can increase that campaign’s efficacy create a business budget with these awareness concepts in mind don’t forget about pr one of the best ways to get nearly free advertising — advertising which is both an effective form of awarenessbuilding and conversion — is to invest in public relations efforts sadly many entrepreneurs go about public relations all wrong members of the media are tasked with presenting new and noteworthy developments to their or their employer’s readership every entrepreneur thinks their new startup is newsworthy and of course it’s interesting—it’s your business however entrepreneurs looking for publicity are biased heck even if you’re not you’ll sound like you are to a reporter who has heard a zillion pitches just like yours not every reporter is going to find your business as fascinating and cutting edge as you do so spamming them to take notice and validate your arrival is a serious misstep as it not only relegates your requests to a trash can but it relegates you to a block list online payroll is not exactly a product full of mystery and intrigue so my team and i know how important it is to frame and pitch the product correctly to have success in the pr game think about the reporter you’re pitching what they cover and who their readership is when you pitch don’t tell them the things you find unique and interesting things about your company tell them what is interesting and relevant in relation to the topics they cover support your claims with numbers and examples and if possible supply multiple angles that make your news more engaging the more interesting and appealing you can make your company to a reporter’s readership the more relevant your company will be to that reporter if your first pitch gets no response that’s not a reason to stop pitching members of the media wake up to boxes stuffed with pitches like yours every day your pitch may be excellent but the sheer volume of demand especially for more prominent members of the media means there will be more rejects and silence than success even so stay persistent  pr is advertising building your brand and an endorsement
