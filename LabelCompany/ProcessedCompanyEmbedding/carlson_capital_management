shares an organization founded to advance philanthropy inspire volunteerism and promote collective leadership greg and his wife nancy live in northfield where they have raised their three daughterspersonal thoughts i have learned that wisdom comes from experience and experience is gathered over time over the past  years i have seen and worked with most of the technical issues people face in developing financial plans but more importantly i have been a part of our clients’ lives i have seen the joys and challenges of wealth i have experienced births and deaths nursing homes divorces retirements and layoffs i have witnessed the best and worst of families the ups and downs of the stock markets the comings and goings of trends and fads i have seen goals set and achieved and opportunities created that no one thought existed i have seen good and bad investments and even invested in a few bad ones myself in the earlier years through all of this i have learned the importance of being technically strong disciplined and trustworthy and to be of uncompromising integrity i am proud to have formed and to be a part of a firm which has these principles at its coremuch of who we are as adults is steeped in our formative years as children and young people i grew up on the prairies of western minnesota where i was exposed to hard work discipline and honesty as one of five children of a school teacher and mother who stayed at home during the childrearing years my life revolved around family church and sports i was expected to do well which meant only my best in my education sports and work but always with a respect and concern for those around mewhen i was  and in the sixth grade one afternoon my teachers gathered the entire class together to review a math test that we had all taken before beginning the review mrs halvorson wanted to draw attention to two students who had done exceptionally well–i was one of them as she proceeded to go through the correct answer and method to each question it became clear to me that she had not corrected my paper accurately as i watched my “a” slip to a “c” i began erasing the wrong answers for which i had received credit and replaced them with the new correct answers at the conclusion of the review i stared at my paper now  correct it took me only moments to reerase the correct answers and replace them with the wrong answers and trudge to the front of the class to inform mrs halvorson that i wasn’t the bright shining student on that examhonesty is a value i hold sacred honesty means always telling the truth even when it hurts honesty means being transparent in how i conduct business and in all aspects of my life most importantly honesty means being authentic even when it shows my flawsit is the foundation of the first  years of my life with the experiences of the following  years that have guided me in working with the clients of carlson capital management and developing our firm into a successful wealth management firm i have a strong desire to excel at both the client and company level but only by earning it it is my philosophy that we need to always excel at taking care of our clients first and that in turn will shape who we are as a firmour success will followjeffrey r carlson cfp®founderjeffrey r carlson cfp®founder666 faxjeffcarlsoncapcom  it is the ability to put data

stacy live in hastings minnesota where they raised their three childrenpersonal thoughts sports have and always will play an important part in my life it is through these activities that i have learned hard work discipline and teamwork let me provide a few examplesas a sophomore on the st olaf basketball team i was disenchanted with my playing time and the lack of opportunities to prove myself with my speech to my coach memorized i walked into his office to make my case for increased playing time before i was even able to say my opening line i was presented with these words “you are slow you make poor decisions and have an inability to score”so i asked myself “do i quit or do i try to prove him wrong” by the end of the season i was the first guard off the bench lettered and was given the “mr hustle” award by my teammates i may not have been the most talented but i understood the value and reward in working hard and doing my best to help the teamanother example recalls how i always wanted to follow in my father’s footsteps as a strategist and coach i can picture my dad days before a tennis match shuffling and reshuffling line ups to get the best opportunity for success against the opposing team to a degree what i really enjoy doing at carlson capital management i learned from my father first i know that to best serve our clients requires expertise and strategy from many different angles including tax estate and investment perspectives understanding data and information is important but it is the ability to put information together into a cohesive plan and structure that requires true expertise experience and leadership second to meet the needs of our clients i am able to act as a coach to incorporate the best game strategies to “prevent unsuccessful outcomes” and create the best opportunity to win – that is how to best accumulate manage and distribute their assets in such a manner as to help them accomplish what is most important to themjustin d

house of the twin cities he also recently completed a term on the schwab advisor services advisory board justin and kristin live in northfield minnesota where they raised their four childrenpersonal thoughts i strongly believe that knowing someone’s personal history creates a window of insight for a client three pieces of information may help describe who i am first i am the last child of ten college educated siblings raised in northeast ohio during the 6′s′s second our family of twelve lived in a three bedroom one bathroom apartment above a store which was owned and run by my mother third i was raised and educated until high school as a catholic graduated from a lutheran college and attended a nondenominational theological graduate schoolwith these three data points you and i can have a great deal of conversation we can discuss the value of money as represented by a household of twelve that rarely ate meat because it was so expensive drank powdered milk and gave recycled birthday cards out as gifts we can discuss hard work – a mother who simultaneously raised  children and ran a successful business we can converse about the value of an education and the persistence and sticktuitiveness required to accomplish such goals we can talk about the political stress of the 6′s and the economic hardships of the ′s in comparison to today’s environment our dialogue could cover sibling relationships how to pay for college how to care for elderly parents and issues of ethical and moral responsibility because no one is immune in my opinion from the wanderings of the human spirit we could enjoy conversation about the role of religion in one’s life our community and our global environmentall of these conversations are part of who carlson capital management is but perhaps not identified in a traditional format along with the years of experience and hundreds of stories of my colleagues all the influences and experiences that we have collectively received dramatically shape our current philosophy and relationship with our clients placing the client in the center of all our actions is not just a nice business slogan to have it is rooted in the fabric of who we are as individuals and what we believe as a firm advocating for a transparent clear and academically proven investment philosophy is not a marketing gimmick it is the foundational equivalent of a “bible” for us as investment advisors establishing delivery channels for our trust tax and philanthropic work so that our clients are truly experiencing an integrative wealth management platform points to our philosophy of broadbased thinking and intelligent holistic planning and actioni am hopeful that when you come to carlson capital management and meet our team you experience not only competency but

work or why things happen the way they do i often would take things apart to see what was happening ‘inside’ frequently with limited success at being able to put them back together little has changed

become a critical commodity” when i was younger i wasn’t sure why he would share such things with me though i knew that in this case he was passing along a quote from his own father then one day during high school track practice his words became quite valuable for me i envisioned that the work of a blacksmith was very repetitive difficult and required focus in addition to physical discipline i realized that success might mean continuing to “pound away” at something as my coach was requiring me to do in sprints i was ultimately rewarded for my hard work with success on the track but even more i was rewarded with discipline as a core value that i continue to carry with me i certainly don’t claim to practice this perfectly it is something toward which i strive and that i try to impart to my own childrenthe importance of being disciplined can demonstrate itself in multiple aspects of our lives it is central to what we do at carlson capital management as well when the financial markets are challenging it requires us to practice the discipline we speak of in theory when the markets are working in our favor – that is “staying the course” we also integrate discipline into the

and their sonpersonal thoughts when i was younger my dad bought me a  john deere model g tractor for the two of us to restore i remember watching as the tractor was unloaded onto our back driveway it was covered in rust smelled like gas and oil but was the most beautiful thing i had ever seeni was tasked with the job of filling a tennisball sized dent on the tractor’s hood then sanding the filler until it was flush with the metal i sanded for hours stopping periodically as my father reviewed my progress and waiting patiently for him to say that my work looked complete i was eager to get the dent filled so the tractor could be painted and the sanding process felt like it was taking forever but my father would consistently find ridges and bumps that i had missed and i would be back to sandingit was through the restoration of this tractor that i learned the importance of patience i learned the importance of putting time and attention into the “little things” as they impact the bigger picture i keep this lesson close to me as an adult and find that patience and attention to detail play key roles in my marketing and communications work at ccm i am constantly seeking to

professionally and become a husband and fatherthough hard work was always emphasized in my family so too was the importance of taking the time to stop now and then to appreciate its benefits – such as

two fantastic children and helping them grow up has been one of the greatest joys of my life i believe that one of the most important life lessons i have attempted to impart upon my kids revolves around the concept of financial wellness as we have discussed on many occasions money truly can’t buy you happiness but the lack of it can make life much more challenging being a good steward of your financial resources is a critical part of creating longterm financial wellbeingmy work with business owners and their employees has allowed me to see firsthand that we are at a critical juncture in society people are far less likely to be covered by a pension plan at their place of work than they were even just twenty years ago the responsibility for a secure retirement has fallen squarely on the shoulders of employees who by and large count on the resources provided by their employer to educate themselves and plan for a successful retirementmy mission is to play my part in creating the most effective and efficient retirement plans for employers then tirelessly serve the needs of their plan participants by educating and motivating them to save the right amount in the right way in order to be able to retire when theyd like to ultimately for me it is about helping more people to enjoy a financially successful retirementcallie geist cfp® jd mbaintegrated wealth advisorcallie

familypersonal thoughts like many minnesotans i grew up with the privilege of “going to the lake” in the summer much to the chagrin of my spouse who hails from the west we midwesterners never really bother to specify which lake it’s just the lake not unlike many families in this area i am fortunate in that early ancestors from norway had the foresight to purchase lake front land where they wasted no time establishing family traditions – including an annual july th celebration and while land is simply land it’s our “landscape” that helps describe the essence of who we are for me that landscape and more precisely “the lake” is really all about familyi recall my wedding day as guests came out of the chapel to greet us in the receiving line my new motherinlaw from out of state stood next to me as i introduced her to many unfamiliar faces she remarked later that every other person was “a cousin from the lake” how right she was in our family it doesn’t matter if one is a first cousin a third cousin twiceremoved or the spouse of a second cousin – we are just cousins cousins range from several months old to those in their nineties and oddly enough we consider ourselves part of an “immediate” family even though the number of us easily exceeds a couple hundred we all grew up spending summers at the lake and we were always accountable to the aunts in the generation or two ahead of us we are there for one another’s weddings funerals and sometimes birthdays we look forward to sharing kransekake and rommegrot we are intent on ensuring that our children know our cousins’ children so to know me is to know that i am a wife and a mother a daughter and a sister a granddaughter and of course “a cousin”all of us at ccm look forward to learning your story because that is how we at ccm have defined ourselves as a company and that is how we will continue to define ourselves in the future we must know you and your story before we can help you accomplish what is important to
