pierce july   home › gardening experts qa with david kennedy author of “eat your greens” share article dave kennedy is the founder and director of leaf for life a nonprofit organization dedicated to the elimination of global malnutrition through the optimum use of leaf crops to support human health he has designed and implemented projects and workshops involving smallscale agriculture and innovative food processing in  different countries on four continents the author of st century greens and the leaf for life handbook david is a tireless advocate for the development of wholesome food systems worldwide  in his latest book eat your greens kennedy demonstrates the surprising power of homegrown leaf crops  read on to learn more enter to win one of two copies from new society publishing  how did you become an advocate for leaf crops when i began gardening many years ago i was fascinated with the idea of growing all the food i needed as i studied the subject it became obvious that leaf crops could produce more of the essential nutrients in less space and in less time than other food crops or livestock curiosity led me to get a masters degree focusing on food systems and to begin working on building more equitable and durable food systems  why is it important that we embark on a reenvisioned home vegetable garden movement which has a greater focus on leafy vegetables what are the advantages i think the home vegetable garden has the potential to address two of our biggest food system problems lack of diversity and low nutrient density we derive something like  of our calories from just four plant species corn rice wheat and soybeans there are over  species of plants with edible leaves greater variety builds greater resiliency at all levels of ecosystems including our food ecosystems calorie rich nutrient poor foods like soda candy and chips force us to consume more calories than we need in order to obtain the required micronutrients this is a primary cause of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes  how does your book help us take leafy vegetables to the next level eat your greens was written to encourage people to explore the possibilities of home gardens i wanted to share my passion for growing leaf crops in a way that was practical and nontechnical but that provided a bit more depth on the subject than most popular gardening books  when it comes to leafy vegetables most of our thoughts likely turn to lettuce and other more traditional choices but the fact remains that there is quite a diverse catalog to choose from just how many species of plants have edible leaves and are there any plants that you would highly recommend for the adventurous gardeners among us and why there are over a thousand plant species with edible leaves in helping people choose which ones to grow i lean towards perennials high nutritional value ease of growing and plants with multiple usesflavor is obviously very important as well but i would suggest that this is not an absolute the north american palate is actually evolving quite rapidly and we are beginning to embrace foods like kale arugula and kimchi that have more complex flavors than those offered by macaroni and cheese and iceberg lettuce there is a good argument to be made for learning to enjoy some plant foods that are nutritious and easy to grow rather than insisting on growing plants that we already enjoy eating even though they may be not be welladapted to our climate or especially useful to our bodies perennial leaf crops such as chaya moringa goji garlic chives pacific hibiscus okinawan spinach and longevity spinach are good choices in many gardens perennials don’t need to be replanted from new seed every year that saves money and it reduces soil disturbance they can all be easily propagated and shared with friends at no cost perennial vegetable crops are also better at capturing carbon from the air and adding it to the soil where it feeds beneficial microbes if you have a little extra space in your garden i recommend experimenting with several new leaf crops to see what grows well where you are and what tastes good to you the internet is making it much easier to track down seeds and cuttings to start unusual garden plants  in your book you mention the importance of seeing plants in their entirety what crops would our readers be surprised to know are actually multiuse this may be a bit of a round about answer but i like to think of home gardens as intimate ecosystems that we manage in a way that is beneficial to us a key to this approach is learning more about the lives of the plants we are growing as we learn a bit of botany we start to see leaves as the dynamic engines of growth stems as supports and transport systems roots as anchors and gatherers of nutrients and water in this view most of the fruits seeds and tubers that are familiar vegetables are where food created in the leaves is stored  food created in leaves can often be intercepted at various point in the plants growth though they are primarily grown primarily for their fruits and roots and seeds the leaves of pumpkins okra sweet potatoes grapes beans peas wheat and many other common food crops are edible and nutritious usually they are more nutritionally dense than the primary product probably the most important category of multiuse garden plants are edible cover crops such as blackeyed peas barley and cowhorn  turnips that can improve the soil while providing nutritious leafy vegetables  your book not only discusses the growing of leafy greens but also in how to prepare them in the kitchen with a section of recipes what is one of your favorite recipes from the book there are a lot of good ways to prepare mild flavored greens like spinach i am especially interested in recipes that encourage us to eat meaningful amounts of some of the nutritionally impressive but stronger flavored and tougher textured greens one that we eat often at home is pasta  made with  dried moringa leaf powder we make up big batches of five pounds of so of dried pasta and pack it in meal sized bags it offers the convenience of ramen noodles with a lot more nutritional punch for milder flavored greens i like malabar bars they are pretty delicious for a snack food that is good for you win one of two copies of ‘eat your greens’ to enter simply

did you become an advocate for leaf crops when i began gardening many years ago i was fascinated with the idea of growing all the food i needed as i studied the subject it became obvious that leaf crops could produce more of the essential nutrients in less space and in less time than other food crops or livestock curiosity led me to get a masters degree focusing on food systems and to begin working on building more equitable and durable food systems  why is it important that we embark on a reenvisioned home vegetable garden movement which has a greater focus on leafy vegetables what are the advantages i think the home vegetable garden has the potential to address two of our biggest food system problems lack of diversity and low nutrient density we derive something like  of our calories from just four plant species corn rice wheat and soybeans there are over  species of plants with edible leaves greater variety builds greater resiliency at all levels of ecosystems including our food ecosystems calorie rich nutrient poor foods like soda candy and chips force us to consume more calories than we need in order to obtain the required micronutrients this is a primary cause of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes  how does your book help us take leafy vegetables to the next level eat your greens was written to encourage people to explore the possibilities of home gardens i wanted to share my passion for growing leaf crops in a way that was practical and nontechnical but that provided a bit more depth on the subject than most popular gardening books  when it comes to leafy vegetables most of our thoughts likely turn to lettuce and other more traditional choices but the fact remains that there is quite a diverse catalog to choose from just how many species of plants have edible leaves and are there any plants that you would highly recommend for the adventurous gardeners among us and why there are over a thousand plant species with edible leaves in helping people choose which ones to grow i lean towards perennials high nutritional value ease of growing and plants with multiple usesflavor is obviously very important as well but i would suggest that this is not an absolute the north american palate is actually evolving quite rapidly and we are beginning to embrace foods like kale arugula and kimchi that have more complex flavors than those offered by macaroni and cheese and iceberg lettuce there is a good argument to be made for learning to enjoy some plant foods that are nutritious and easy to grow rather than insisting on growing plants that we already enjoy eating even though they may be not be welladapted to our climate or especially useful to our bodies perennial leaf crops such as chaya moringa goji garlic chives pacific hibiscus okinawan spinach and longevity spinach are good choices in many gardens perennials don’t need to be replanted from new seed every year that saves money and it reduces soil disturbance they can all be easily propagated and shared with friends at no cost perennial vegetable crops are also better at capturing carbon from the air and adding it to the soil where it feeds beneficial microbes if you have a little extra space in your garden i recommend experimenting with several new leaf crops to see what grows well where you are and what tastes good to you the internet is making it much easier to track down seeds and cuttings to start unusual garden plants  in your book you mention the importance of seeing plants in their entirety what crops would our readers be surprised to know are actually multiuse this may be a bit of a round about answer but i like to think of home gardens as intimate ecosystems that we manage in a way that is beneficial to us a key to this approach is learning more about the lives of the plants we are growing as we learn a bit of botany we start to see leaves as the dynamic engines of growth stems as supports and transport systems roots as anchors and gatherers of nutrients and water in this view most of the fruits seeds and tubers that are familiar vegetables are where food created in the leaves is stored  food created in leaves can often be intercepted at various point in the plants growth though they are primarily grown primarily for their fruits and roots and seeds the leaves of pumpkins okra sweet potatoes grapes beans peas wheat and many other common food crops are edible and nutritious usually they are more nutritionally dense than the primary product probably the most important category of multiuse garden plants are edible cover crops such as blackeyed peas barley and cowhorn  turnips that can improve the soil while providing nutritious leafy vegetables  your book not only discusses the growing of leafy greens but also in how to prepare them in the kitchen with a section of recipes what is one of your favorite recipes from the book there are a lot of good ways to prepare mild flavored greens like spinach i am especially interested in recipes that encourage us to eat meaningful amounts of some of the nutritionally impressive but stronger flavored and tougher textured greens one that we eat often at home is pasta  made with  dried moringa leaf powder we make up big batches of five pounds of so of dried pasta and pack it in meal sized bags it offers the convenience of ramen noodles with a lot more nutritional punch for milder flavored greens i like malabar bars they are pretty delicious for a snack food that is good for you win one of two copies of ‘eat your greens’ to enter simply leave a

pinterest youtube snapchat archivedavid a kennedy by peter carlsonposted on may   at pm edt sharetweetemail pinterest on saturday night three days before he died david kennedy asked robert driscoll to paint a flower for him a longtime friend of the kennedy family driscoll  exhibits his paintings at the brazilian court the elegant palm beach hotel where david was spending easter accompanied by a date chestnuthaired leslie griffin  of greenwich conn kennedy spotted the artist wandering among the palms and orange trees on the grounds and asked him to paint a red anemone “david asked for it because it is a very sexy flower” says driscoll “the girl showed an interest in having the painting but i told david he must keep it for himself he thanked me and agreed it became his farewell his last request” for driscoll that is a fond memory one that illuminates the softer side of a sensitive young man whom he loved as “a kindred spirit” it was not however a scene typical of this tormented young kennedy’s final days david had arrived in palm beach two days earlier on april  fresh from a stay in a drug program at st mary’s rehabilitation center in st paul minn there was no room for him and some other family members at the mansion of his ailing grandmother rose  but along with the rest of the kennedy clan he made dutiful daily visits there the rest of his days and nights were spent in a relentless pursuit of oblivion he started drinking in the morning double vodkas often three at a time smuggled into the perpetual dusk of his curtained room even before the hotel bar opened at  in the afternoons he lounged around the hotel pool at night he hit the local bars sometimes with relatives and friends sometimes alone “he could really slam ’em back double vodkas on the rocks” recalls shaun donnelly the bartender at doherty’s a preppy piano bar “he’d drink that much and it didn’t show” donnelly saw kennedy during the afternoon at night the drink sometimes did show “he looked a mess” says kim waldron a cocktail waitress in the same bar she didn’t recognize the haggard unshaven young man until he paid for his drinks with an american express card bearing the name mrs robert kennedy david threw waldron a lame line—he said he was new in town and asked her to show him around—but she declined “i didn’t want to be seen with anybody who looked like that” she says a member of the brazilian court staff says david appeared sickly “he had an old body for such a young man” on sunday the day after painting the flower driscoll saw david at a splash party cohosted by leslie around a pearshape pool on a nearby estate “by that time david had begun to look pretty bad” he says “he was out of it taking demerol and drinking a lot of vodka he had been on methadone he was the wrong person to be drinking” he certainly was david anthony kennedy in his short  years of life already had caused himself more than enough trouble with drink and drugs once he’d been mugged in a sleazy harlem hotel known as a drug supermarket and “shooting gallery” twice he’d been arrested for drunk driving at least five times he had been in and out of drug treatment programs although he wasn’t the only kennedy boy to use drugs david had long been identified as the problem child the one in constant crisis “david died of despair” says a kennedy friend in boston “he really did believe that everyone in the family regarded him as merely a skeleton to be kept closeted” even before tragedy blasted his family david was a dreamy introvert in a crowd of outgoing boisterous competitors his father robert kennedy—like david the scrawny shy third son in a large family—understood him best he took pains to nurture the boy to bring him to his senate office on saturdays to make sure that the frail towhead saw his share of action in the family’s trademark touchfootball games on june   while california democrats cast their votes in their presidential primary bobby took david for a swim at malibu the ocean not particularly pacific that day snatched the scared yearold from the surf and dragged him out into the deep water bobby kennedy swam after the boy clutching him to his chest and carrying him back to shore it was the last service bobby performed for david that night alone for hours in a hotel room and overlooked in the commotion david stared at the live television coverage of his father’s assassination he didn’t speak for days afterward the magnitude of his loss is hinted at in the touching tribute he wrote six months later as a christmas surprise for his mother “daddy was very funny in church because he would embarrass all of us by singing very loud daddy did not have a very good voice there will be no more football with daddy no more sailing with him no more riding and no more camping with him but he was the best father their sic ever was and i would rather have had him for a father for the length of time i did than any other father for a million years” his father’s death seemed to end any sense of order or direction in david’s life that summer his mother sent him to austria where he had his first sexual encounter it was with a yearold girl who in the process mumbled something about feeling sorry about his father later that year his older brother bobby gave him a tab of mescaline at  david hitchhiked with his cousin chris lawford to new york where they panhandled in grand central station and with the money bought heroin in central park for the first time by then david was a dedicated doper starting his days at middlesex academy in concord mass with a morning joint and tripping on acid frequently the drug use increased after david severely injured his back and his girlfriend pam kelley was paralyzed in his brother joe’s jeep accident on cape cod in the hospital david received morphine to relieve the pain in his back upon his release he began experimenting with heroin to ease his psychic anguish ethel kennedy tried various strategies to set her son straight during one summer vacation she sent him to work with labor organizer cesar chavez in the lettuce fields in california during another she dispatched him to do manual labor on a ranch in colorado but his problems were not so easily remedied by being thrust out on his own unlike his brothers david confronted his mother with his pain over christmas at aspen one friend recalls david an expert skier would lie on the couch in his mother’s house all day and have his food brought to him by a maid whenever he tried to bring up his father’s death ethel would cut him off “no one ever talked to me about what i was feeling” david told peter collier and david horowitz authors of the forthcoming book the kennedys an american drama to be published in june by summit books “nobody ever talked to me about my father’s death to this day in fact my mother has never talked to me about it” in the fall of  david arrived at harvard “he was incredibly emaciated and white faced” a classmate remembers “he was walking death” he lasted two years then dropped out and headed for new york where he frequently made the gossip columns squiring attractive women including actress rachel ward to trendy discos “it was tons of fun” says a pal who went along for the ride “david was a real gentleman he really cared about his friends and treated them well” but his close friends were worried “he’d come home so completely out of it you’d have to watch him really carefully” says one intimate “you never knew if he would do something like drop a lighted cigarette and set the place on fire everyone around him was completely scared they were all keeping tabs on him calling him calling other people to check where he was and who he was with” this friend remembers crashing one night in david’s apartment and waking to the sound of sobbing “i asked him if he wanted to talk” he says “he didn’t” in september  david was beaten and robbed in a harlem hotel that catered to the dope trade a week later he was hospitalized with bacterial endocarditis a disease frequently associated with drug abuse friends say he nearly died the kennedy family dispatched him to a series of drugtreatment programs finally in february  the family hired sacramento calif detoxer donald juhl  whose clients have included the late beach boy dennis wilson actor janmichael vincent and reportedly david’s brother bobby jr after his south dakota arrest for heroin possession last year juhl is said to have treated the wayward david in hyannis port and then taken him to sacramento in february  david told a friend that juhl’s treatment cost  which he said came out of his trust fund five months later he was arrested for drunken driving an offense he repeated in sacramento within two years patrick powers a sacramento advertising consultant and kennedy acquaintance watched david hit the bars and drift into more dangerous pursuits “i saw him party and i saw him get stoned” he says “he never really got off it” in june  david met hairstylist nancie alexander  through associates of his drug counselor although they shared few interests—she is a fundamentalist christian and a conservative republican—their platonic friendship thrived and david found he could confide in the motherly nancie “i said to him ‘do you think people expect more of you because of who you are’ he said people should expect more ‘i have everything they want and they don’t understand why i don’t use it to the fullest’ ” she recalls “he wanted his mother’s respect he wanted to grow up and he wanted to be well” at one point nancie says david became an amway distributor and enthusiastically “believed he could become a millionaire” another time he worked as a laborer for a cement firm “if you were around david for any time it would make you cry” nancie says “he was so lost he was bent on going down a oneway street the wrong way” in  he went home for christmas and brought back to sacramento a new girlfriend—freelance photographer paula sculley they moved in together and remained close until his death “when paula came into his life they were inseparable” says alexander “she accepted him  percent and she took care of him paula wasn’t into drugs” david left sacramento in the fall of  telling friends there that he planned to return to harvard then go to law school or into journalism he occasionally hung out his kennedybred ambitions like tattered banners “we used to drive by the justice department and david would say ‘i’m gonna be up there one day i’m gonna be attorney general’ ” says a washington friend remembering david’s desire to emulate his father to be readmitted to harvard david took a sixmonth job at the atlantic monthly he worked as a glorified clerk and gofer but even that menial job sometimes seemed too much for him and coworkers found him unable to concentrate or even to remain awake but he held on and then entered harvard completing a summer and a fall semester before he dropped out again on march  he checked into st mary’s rehabilitation center under the name of david kilroy he seemed merely to be going through the motions “it was pretty obvious that he was resisting” said one staff member “he was in his own world he was brought up to hide his feelings and he was scared to death” on thursday april  after  days at a daily fee of  david left st mary’s and flew to palm beach he checked into a anight tworoom suite at the brazilian court near his younger brother douglas  who was with a friend from georgetown prep when douglas was around david drank soda or perrier the hotel staff noticed but when douglas left him alone david guzzled vodka that ruse did not fool his family by tuesday morning concerned family members were calling his room only to find the phone busy for hours they requested that someone check up on him at  pm bell captain doug moschiano went to his room ignored the “do not disturb” sign and knocked there was no answer he unlocked the door and peeked in david was in bed asleep with the phone off the hook that afternoon david took a cab to visit his grandmother and returned to the hotel around  the next morning his mother worried that he was not back in boston phoned the front desk again moschiano checked the room this time accompanied by hotel secretary betty barnett “douglas and i were standing outside david’s door when i had the most ominous feeling” she says “call it a mother’s gut instinct or whatever but i knew what we would find” they knocked heard no answer then entered david was lying on the floor between twin beds that hadn’t been slept in wearing beige shorts a preppy pink shirt brown socks and offwhite topsiders a packed green duffle bag was on one bed a dollar bill on the other “i touched his face” says barnett “and there was no doubt about it he was dead” paramedics on a training mission nearby arrived only a minute later there was nothing they could do police found a prescription pill bottle and  grams of highquality cocaine in the room the autopsy results revealed cocaine and demerol in his bloodstream a few days later david’s friend robert driscoll the artist speculated about david’s last hours “he had driven his brother doug and his friend to the airport on monday” he said “he was left alone he was depressed and letdown after a partyfilled five days he went to his room alone to go to bed early then he pumped himself up…” driscoll paused then spoke slowly “i’ll miss david all the others are tough they are different soil than david they handled their father’s death but it hit david harder he suffered too much” it was a suffering no one could help him with he succumbed to it alone show full article most popular  the oj nobody knew — read peoples july   cover story  martin

unfortunately the boy scouts has a welldocumented yearold problem with child sexual abuse in scouting since the s the boy scouts of america has been aware that sexual predators use positions of trust like scoutmaster or assistant scoutmaster to sexually abuse boys in scouting  by  the bsa had already established a “red flag” system used in part to identify adult volunteers who were known to sexually molest scouts this red flag system evolved into what is now known as the “ineligible volunteer files” iv files or “perversion files” despite bsa’s awareness of these pedophiles too often the organization did nothing to prevent predators from having access to boy scouts in fact bsa sometimes knowing decided to allow known pedophiles to continue working with boys in scouting under a secret internal policy they called “probation” the attorneys at crew janci llp have represented many men who were sexually abused in scouting – including in cub scout packs webelos blazer scouts boy scouts
