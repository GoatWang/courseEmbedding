cultures of nascar and extreme sports david leonard identifies how whiteness is central to the commodification of athletes and the sports they playleonard demonstrates that sporting cultures are a key site in the trafficking of racial ideas narratives and ideologies he identifies how white athletes are frequently characterized as intelligent leaders who are presumed innocent of the kinds of transgressions black athletes are often pathologized for with an analysis of the racial dynamics of sports traditions as varied as football cycling hockey baseball tennis snowboarding and soccer as well as the reception and media portrayals of specific white athletes leonard examines how and why whiteness matters within sports and what that tells us about race in the twentyfirst century united

contemporary us social and political discourse in playing while white leonard expertly explicates the extent to which sport plays an important role in constructing and privileging white identity politics in american society jessica luther leonards indepth investigation at how whiteness operates in sport and in turn our society at large is smart cutting nuanced and above all important it is a necessary work for this time bomani jones for years leonard has demonstrated an understanding of the modern sporting landscape and a touch for applying academic insight to this most secular world his voice and mind lend both gravity and dexterity on these topics mark anthony neal few have talked about race and sports with the passion and critical acuity of david j leonard with playing while white he takes the road less paved and turns his attention to whiteness exploding the myths of privilege and entitlement that we are all too willing to assign to black athletes lori martin examines the effects of the dominant racial ideology on american sports and highlights the ways that whiteness is privileged above other racial identities playing while white will appeal to sports fans interested in ways to explain the racial disparities in american sports dave zirin david leonard is one of our most brutally honest truth tellers he uses sports as a lens to understand how sports can both challenge and perpetuate institutionalized racism its a book for the conscious sports fan and people unafraid to discuss these issues with candor and clarity i cant recommend it enough michael eric dyson systemic racism is often explored within the contexts of many of our institutions government education criminal justice playing while white thoughtfully engages in a discourse around the privilege that whiteness affords highlighting the ways that white athletes and whiteness are profiled as innocent desirable smart and exceptional this is in sharp juxtaposition to the way that black bodies continue to be policed and profiled demonized and denigrated both on and off of the field this poses the following query do black lives matter in the world of sports leonards brilliant and
