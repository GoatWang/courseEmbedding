curing them salerno opines that there are contradictions in richard bandler and john grinder the cofounders of nlp ending up in court over who owned the rights to nlp given nlps promotion in business

flaws and misconceptions in the ideas in particular about health and diet in robbins us national best seller unlimited power  the new science of personal achievement robbins believes that deep breathing activates the lymphatic system and likens the lymphatic system to the sewerage system of the body jarvis states that there is no evidence that different breathing makes longlasting changes in the lymphatic system but that any effects are temporary jarvis agrees with robbins encouraging participants to eat more fruit but criticizes the way it is presented according to jarvis robbins incorrectly argues that fruit is the perfect food in contrast jarvis argues that milk is the closest to being the most complete food jarvis states that some of the information about drinking distilled water gives an inaccurate view of how the body metabolic wastes system functions jarvis believes that there are misconceptions about health benefits of food combining which are supposedly based on herbert sheltons ideas and that robbins evidence of a positive effect of undereating is flawed jarvis also writes that robbins makes inaccurate claims about dietary protein requirements robbins also recycles an oftcited but unsubstantiated reference to the yale study of goals in unlimited power as scientific evidence of the power of positive thought the anecdote claims that a survey was taken of the  graduating class at yale and only  of the class had written goals regarding their financial situations twenty years later the class was interviewed again and the  of the class who had written goals were worth more than the other  of the students combined this would have been strong evidence of the power of written goal setting but the alleged yale study appears to be an urban legend
