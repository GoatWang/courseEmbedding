treatment does the company support incentive funding discounting yes the company will lower the cost of insurance charges by  during any policy year for which you qualify for an incentive funding discount to qualify total premiums paid under the policy less any debt withdrawals and withdrawal charges and transfers from other policies issued by the company must exceed  of the guideline level premiums as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  the code accumulated from the date of issue to the date of qualification the incentive funding discount is not available in all states the amount needed to qualify for the incentive funding discount is determined on the date of issue for the first policy year and on each policy anniversary for each subsequent policy year if the company receives the proceeds from a policy issued by an unaffiliated company to be exchanged for the policy however the qualification for the incentive funding discount for the first policy year will be determined on the date the proceeds are received by the company and only insurance charges becoming due after the date such proceeds are received will be eligible for the incentive funding discount

agents all premium payments after the initial premium payment are credited to the variable account or the general account as of date of receipt at the principal office payments received before the close of business usually  pm eastern time or the close of the new york stock exchange if earlier on a business day will normally be credited to the variable account or the fixed account as of the end of that day if we receive your payment after the close of business on a business day your payment or request will be effective as of the end of the next business day premium flexibility unlike conventional insurance policies the policy does not obligate you to pay premiums in accordance with a rigid and inflexible premium schedule you may establish a schedule of planned premiums which will be billed by the company at regular intervals failure to pay planned premiums will not itself cause the policy to lapse however if the optional guaranteed death benefit rider is in effect certain minimum premium payment tests must be met you also may make unscheduled premium payments at any time prior to the final premium payment date or skip planned premium payments subject to the maximum and minimum premium limitations described below you also may elect to pay premiums by means of a monthly automatic payment procedure under this procedure amounts will be deducted each month from your checking account generally on the monthly payment date from your checking account and applied as a premium under a policy the minimum payment permitted under this procedure is  premiums are not limited as to frequency and number no premium payment may be less than  however without the companys consent moreover premium payments must be sufficient to provide a positive surrender value at the end of each policy month or the policy may lapse minimum monthly factor the minimum monthly factor is a monthly premium amount calculated by the company and specified in the policy if in the first  policy months following date of issue or the effective date of an increase in the face amount or of a policy change which causes a change in the minimum monthly factor  you make premium payments less debt partial withdrawals and partial withdrawal charges at least equal to the sum of the minimum monthly factors for the number of months the policy increase in face amount or policy change has been in force and  debt does not exceed policy value less surrender charges then  the policy is guaranteed not to lapse during that period except for the  policy month periods making monthly payments at least equal to the minimum monthly factor does not guarantee that the policy will remain in force in no event may the total of all premiums paid exceed the current maximum premium limitations set forth in the policy which are required by federal tax laws these maximum premium limitations will change whenever there is any change in the face amount the addition or deletion of a rider or a change in the sum insured option if a premium is paid which would result in total premiums exceeding the current maximum premium limitations the company will accept only that portion of the premiums that shall make total premiums equal the maximum any part of the premiums in excess of that amount will be returned and no further premiums will be accepted until allowed by the current maximum premium limitation prescribed by internal revenue service irs rules notwithstanding the current maximum premium limitations however the company will accept a premium that is needed in order to prevent a lapse of the policy during a policy year how do i allocate my net payments the net premium equals the premium paid less the   in new york payment expense charge in the application for a policy you indicate the initial allocation of net premiums among the general account and the subaccounts of the variable account you may allocate premiums to one or more subaccounts but may not have policy value in more than  subaccounts at any one time the minimum amount that may be allocated to a subaccount is  of net premium paid allocation percentages must be in whole numbers for example   may not be chosen and must total  paposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st future changes allowed you may change the allocation of future net premiums at any time pursuant to written or telephone request an allocation change will be effective as of the date of receipt of the notice at the principal office investment risk the policy value in the subaccounts will vary with their investment experience you bear this investment risk the investment performance may affect the death proceeds as well policyowners should periodically review their allocations of premiums and policy value in light of market conditions and overall financial planning requirements can i make transfers yes subject to the companys then current rules you may transfer the policy value among the subaccounts or between a subaccount and the general account however the policy value held in the general account to secure a policy loan may not be transferred if we receive a transfer request after the close of business generally  pm eastern time or the close of the new york stock exchange if earlier it will be effected at the end of the next business day is the transfer privilege subject to any limitations yes the transfer privilege is subject to the companys consent the company reserves the right to impose limitations on transfers including but not limited to  the minimum or maximum amount that may be transferred  the minimum amount that may remain in a subaccount following a transfer from that subaccount  the minimum period of time between transfers and  the maximum number of transfers in a period currently transfers to and from the general account are permitted only if  there has been at least a day period since the last transfer from the general account and  the amount transferred from the general account in each transfer does not exceed the lesser of  or  of the accumulated value under the policy if you request a transfer from a subaccount that is higher than your policy value in the subaccount on the valuation date for the transfer request for example if you request a transfer of  from a subaccount and the policy value in the subaccount is only  on the valuation date we will transfer all of the policy value in the subaccount currently the first  transfers in a policy year will be free of any charge thereafter a  transfer charge will be deducted from the amount transferred for each transfer in that policy year the company may increase or decrease this charge but it is guaranteed never to exceed  any transfers made with respect to a conversion privilege policy loan or material change in investment policy will not count towards the  free transfers these rules are subject to change by the company are there restrictions on market timers yes the policy is not designed for use by individuals professional market timing organizations or other entities that do market timing programmed transfers frequent transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of an underlying fund these and similar activities may adversely affect a funds ability to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies and may harm other policyowners accordingly individuals and organizations that use markettiming investment strategies and make frequent transfers should not invest in the policy in order to prevent market timing activities that may harm or disadvantage other policyowners the company may a reject or restrict any specific purchase and transfer requests and b impose specific limitations with respect to paposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd market timers including restricting transfers by market timers to certain underlying funds in addition some of the underlying funds have reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse purchase or transfer requests from the company if in the judgment of the underlying funds investment adviser the underlying fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective or policies or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected accordingly the company may not be in a position to effect certain transfers requested by market timers and may refuse such transfer requests without prior notice we reserve the right to impose without prior notice restrictions on transfers that we determine in our sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other policyowners if any of these actions are taken we will notify the market timer of the action as soon as practicable is there a dollarcost averaging option or automatic rebalancing option yes you may have automatic transfers of at least  a month made on a periodic basis  from the subaccounts which invest in the ait money market fund and ait government bond fund respectively to one or more of the other subaccounts dollarcost averaging option or  to reallocate policy value among the subaccounts automatic rebalancing option automatic transfers may be made on a monthly bimonthly quarterly semiannual or annual schedule the first automatic transfer counts as one transfer towards the  free transfers allowed in each policy year each subsequent automatic transfer is without charge and does not reduce the remaining number of transfers which may be made free of charge generally all transfers will be processed on the th of each scheduled month if the th is not a business day however or is the monthly payment date the automatic transfer will be processed on the next business day the dollarcost averaging option and the automatic rebalancing option may not be in effect at the same time if the policy goes into a grace period see what are the termination provisions of the policy under termination and reinstatement automatic dollar cost averaging and automatic account rebalancing transactions are suspended if you make sufficient payments to keep the policy in force dollar cost averaging and automatic account rebalancing will resume with the next scheduled automatic transaction can i make future changes under my policy yes there are several changes you can make after receiving your policy within limits you may  cancel your policy under its righttoexamine provision  transfer your ownership to someone else  change the beneficiary  change the allocation of payments with no tax consequences under current law  make transfers of policy value among the funds  adjust the death benefit by increasing or decreasing the face amount  change your choice of death benefit

increase or decrease the specified face amount of a policy at any time by submitting a written request to the company you may increase or decrease the face amount by written request an increase or decrease in the face amount takes effect on the latest of the  the monthly processing date on or next following date of receipt of your written request or  the date of approval of your written request

after the insured reaches age  a written request for an increase must include a payment if the surrender value is less than the sum of   plus  two minimum monthly payments on the effective date of each increase in face amount we will deduct a transaction charge of  from policy value for administrative costs we will also compute a surrender charge for the increase an increase in the face amount will increase the insurance protection amount and therefore the monthly insurance protection charges after increasing the face amount you will have the right during a freelook period to have the increase canceled see the policy  freelook period if you exercise this right we will credit to your policy the charges deducted for the increase unless you request a refund of these charges an increase in the face amount generally will affect the insurance amount at risk and may affect the portion of the insurance amount at risk included in various premium classes if more than one premium class applies both of which may affect the monthly cost of insurance charges a surrender charge also will be calculated for the increase decreases in the face amount you may decrease the face amount by written request the minimum amount for a decrease in face amount is  the minimum face amount in force after a decrease is  we may limit the decrease or return policy value to you as you choose if the policy would not comply with the maximum payment limitation under federal tax law a return of policy value may result in tax liability to you a decrease in the face amount will lower the insurance protection amount and therefore the monthly insurance protection charge in computing the monthly insurance protection charge a decrease in the face amount will reduce the face amount in the following order  the face amount provided by the most recent increase  the next most recent increases successively and  the initial face amount on a decrease in the face amount we will deduct from the policy value a transaction charge of  and if applicable any surrender charge you may allocate the deduction to one subaccount if you make no allocation we will make a prorata allocation we will reduce the surrender charge by the amount of any surrender charge deducted can i convert my policy into a fixed policy once during the first  months after the date of issue or after the effective date of an increase in face amount assuming the policy is in force you may convert your policy without evidence of insurability to a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy with fixed and guaranteed minimum benefits assuming that there have been no increases in the initial face amount you can accomplish this within  months after the date of issue by transferring without charge the policy value in

provisions  delay of payments we will allocate the loan among the subaccounts and the fixed account according to your instructions if you do not make an allocation we will make a prorata allocation we will transfer policy value in each subaccount equal to the policy loan to the fixed account we will not count this transfer as a transfer subject to the transfer charge policy value equal to the outstanding loan will earn monthly interest in the fixed account at an annual rate of at least  at least  for preferred loans no other interest will be credited if you are a participant under a section b tsa plan and purchased the policy in connection with the plan your policy loan rights are limited see policies issued in connection with tsa plans below and federal tax considerations

foreclosure of an outstanding loan will terminate the optional guaranteed death benefit rider effect of policy loans we will deduct any outstanding loan from the proceeds payable when the insured dies or from a surrender although policy loans may be repaid at any time prior to the lapse of the policy policy loans will permanently affect the policy value and surrender value and may permanently affect the death proceeds the effect could be favorable or unfavorable depending upon whether the investment performance of the subaccounts is less than or greater than the interest credited to the policy value in the general account attributable to the loan moreover outstanding policy loans and the accrued interest will be deducted from the proceeds payable upon the death of the insured or surrender are policy loans permitted if the policy was issued in connection with a tsa plan if your policy was issued in connection with a tsa plan policy loans are permitted in accordance with the terms of the policy however if a policy loan does not comply with the requirements of code section p the tsa plan may become disqualified and policy values may be includible in your current income

paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th yes after the first policy year you may withdraw part of the surrender value of your policy on written request your written request must state the dollar amount you wish to receive you may allocate the amount withdrawn among the subaccounts and the fixed account if you do not provide allocation instructions we will make a prorata allocation each partial withdrawal must be at least  under the level option the face amount is reduced by the partial withdrawal we will not allow a partial withdrawal if it would reduce the level option face amount below  a withdrawal from a subaccount will result in the cancellation of the number of accumulation units equivalent in value to the amount withdrawn the amount withdrawn equals the amount requested by you plus the transaction charge and any applicable partial withdrawal charge normally the company will pay the amount of the partial withdrawal within seven days following the companys receipt of the partial withdrawal request but the company may delay payment under certain circumstances for important tax consequences of partial withdrawals see federal tax considerations if the policy is

value is the total value of your policy it is the sum of your accumulation in the fixed account plus the value of your units in the subaccounts there is no guaranteed minimum policy value policy value

performance of your subaccounts  partial withdrawals  loans loan repayments and loan interest paid or credited  charges and deductions under the policy  the death benefit option computing policy value we compute the policy value on the date of issue and on each valuation date on the date of issue the policy value is  the value of the amount allocated to the money market fund net of mortality and expense risk charges administrative charges and fund expenses minus  the monthly insurance protection charge due on each valuation date after the date of issue the policy value is the sum of accumulations in the fixed account plus the sum of the products of  the number of units in each subaccount times  the value of a unit in each subaccount on the valuation date the unit we allocate each net payment to the subaccounts you selected we credit allocations to the subaccounts as units units are credited separately for each subaccount the number of units of each subaccount credited to the policy is the quotient of  that part of the net payment allocated to the subaccount divided by  the dollar value of a unit on the valuation date the payment is received at our principal office the number of units will remain fixed unless changed by a split of unit value transfer partial withdrawal or surrender paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th also each deduction of charges from a subaccount will result in cancellation of units equal in value to the amount deducted the dollar value of a unit of a subaccount varies from valuation date to valuation date based on the investment experience of that subaccount this investment experience reflects the investment performance expenses and charges of the fund in which the subaccount invests the value of each unit was set at  on the first valuation date of each subaccount the value of a unit on any valuation date is the product of  the dollar value of the unit on the preceding valuation date times  the net investment factor net investment factor the net investment factor measures the investment performance of a subaccount during the valuation period just ended the net investment factor for each subaccount is  plus the quotient of  the investment income of that subaccount for the valuation period adjusted for realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and for taxes during the valuation period divided by  the value of that subaccounts assets at the beginning of the valuation period minus  the mortality and expense risk charge for each day in the valuation period currently at an annual rate of  of the daily net asset value of that subaccount and  the administrative charge for each day in the valuation period at an annual rate of  of the daily net asset value of that subaccount only during the first ten policy years the net investment factor may be greater or less than one therefore the value of a unit may increase or decrease you bear the investment risk allocations to the general account are not converted into accumulation units but are credited interest at a rate periodically set by the company see  the death benefit the policy provides two death benefit options the level option and the adjustable option for more information see what are the level option and adjustable option below if the policy is in force on the insureds death we will with due proof of death pay the net death benefit under the applicable death benefit option to the named beneficiary we will normally pay the net death benefit within seven days of receiving due proof of the insureds death but we may delay payment of net death benefits see other policy provisions  delay of payments the beneficiary may receive the net death benefit in a lump sum or under a payment option before the final payment date the net death benefit is  the death benefit provided under the level option or adjustable option whichever is elected and in effect on the date of death plus  any other insurance on the insureds life that is provided by rider minus  any outstanding loan partial withdrawals partial withdrawal costs and due and unpaid monthly insurance protection charges through the policy month in which the insured dies after the final payment date if the guaranteed death benefit rider is not in effect the net death benefit is  the policy value minus  any outstanding loan where permitted by state law we will compute the net death benefit on  the date we receive due proof of the insureds death under the adjustable option or paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  the date of death for the level option if required by state law we will compute the net death benefit on the date of death for the adjustable option as well as for the level option what are the level option and the adjustable option option the policy provides two death benefit options the level option and adjustable option you choose the desired option in the application or enrollment form you may change the option once per policy year by written request there is no charge for a change in option under the level option the death benefit is the greater of the  face amount or  guideline minimum sum insured under the adjustable option the death benefit is the greater of the  face amount plus policy value or  guideline minimum sum insured the guideline minimum sum insured is a percentage of the policy value as computed based on federal tax regulations which will ensure that the policy qualifies as a life insurance contract and that the insurance proceeds will be excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary under both the level option and adjustable option the death benefit provides insurance protection under the level option the death benefit is level unless the guideline minimum sum insured exceeds the face amount then the death benefit varies as the policy value changes under the adjustable option the death benefit always varies as the policy value changes at any face amount the death benefit will be greater under the adjustable option than under the level option because the policy value is added to the face amount and included in the death benefit however the monthly insurance protection charge will be greater therefore policy value will accumulate at a slower rate than under the level option if you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected in the death benefit you should choose the adjustable option if you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the policy value you should select the level option can i change the death benefit option you may change the death benefit option once each policy year by written request changing options will not require evidence of insurability the change takes effect on the monthly processing date on or following the date of receipt of the written request we will impose no charge for changes in death benefit options if you change the level option to the adjustable option we will decrease the face amount to equal  the death benefit minus  the policy value on the date of the change the change may not be made if the face amount would fall below  after the change from the level option to the adjustable option future monthly insurance protection charges may be higher or lower than if no change in option had been made however the insurance protection amount will always equal the face amount unless the guideline minimum sum insured applies if you change the adjustable option to the level option we will increase the face amount by the policy value on the date of the change the death benefit will be the greater of paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  the new face amount or  the guideline minimum sum insured after the change from the adjustable option to the

the policy from terminating because of insufficient surrender value this guarantee applies if during this period you pay premiums that when reduced by partial withdrawals and partial withdrawal costs equal or exceed specified minimum monthly payments the specified minimum monthly payments are based on the number of months the policy increase in face amount or policy change that causes a change in

current premium tax deduction of   in new york  current deferred acquisition costs dac tax deduction of   frontend sales load of  the  premium tax deduction approximates our average expenses for state and local premium taxes premium taxes vary ranging from zero to more than  the premium tax deduction is made whether or not any premium tax applies the deduction may be higher or lower than the premium tax imposed however we do not expect to make a profit from this deduction the  dac tax deduction helps reimburse us for approximate expenses incurred from federal taxes for deferred acquisition costs dac taxes of the policies we deduct the  frontend sales load from each payment partially to compensate us for policy sales expenses we reserve the right to increase or decrease the premium tax deduction or dac tax deduction to reflect changes in our expenses for premium what are the monthly insurance protection charges before the final payment date we will deduct a monthly insurance protection charge from your policy value this charge is the cost for insurance protection under the policy including optional insurance benefits provided by rider we deduct the monthly insurance protection charge on each monthly processing date starting with the date of issue you may allocate monthly insurance protection charges to one subaccount if you make no allocation we will make a prorata allocation if the subaccount you chose does not have sufficient funds to cover the monthly insurance protection charges we will make a prorata allocation we will deduct no monthly insurance protection charges on or after the final payment date we designed the monthly insurance protection charge to compensate us for the anticipated cost of paying net death benefits under the

plus the policy value if you selected the adjustable option we will adjust the monthly insurance protection charge for any decreases in face amount see the policy change in face amount decreases how are the insurance protection rates determined we base insurance protection rates on the  male female or blended unisex rate table  age and underwriting class of the insured  effective date of an increase or date of any rider for unisex policies sexdistinct rates do not apply for the initial face amount the insurance protection rates are based on your age at the beginning of each policy year for an increase in face amount or for a rider the insurance protection rates are based on your age on each anniversary of the effective date of the increase or rider we base the current insurance protection rates on our expectations as to future mortality experience rates will not however be greater than the guaranteed insurance protection rates set forth in the policy these guaranteed rates are based on the commissioners  standard ordinary mortality tables smoker or nonsmoker mortality table b for unisex policies and the insureds sex and age the tables used for this purpose set forth different mortality estimates for males and females and for smokers and nonsmokers any change in the insurance protection rates will apply to all insureds of the same age sex and underwriting class whose policies have been in force for the same period the underwriting class of an insured will affect the insurance protection rates we currently place insureds into preferred underwriting classes standard underwriting classes and nonstandard underwriting classes the underwriting classes are also divided into two categories smokers and nonsmokers we will place an insured under age  at the date of issue in a standard or nonstandard underwriting class we will then classify the insured as a smoker at age  unless we receive satisfactory evidence that the insured is a nonsmoker prior to the insureds age  we will give you notice of how the insured may be classified as a nonsmoker we compute the insurance protection rate separately for the initial face amount and for any increase in face amount however if the insureds underwriting class improves on an increase the lower insurance protection rate will apply to the total face amount what charges are made against or reflected in the assets of the variable account we assess each subaccount with a charge for mortality and expense risks we assume and during the first ten policy years a charge for administrative expenses of the variable account fund expenses are also reflected in the variable account paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th mortality and expense risk charge we impose a daily charge at a current annual rate of  of the average daily net asset value of each subaccount this charge compensates us for assuming mortality and expense risks for variable interests in the policies the company may increase this charge subject to state and federal law to an annual rate no greater than  the mortality risk we assume is that insureds may live for a shorter time than anticipated if this happens we will pay more net death benefits than anticipated the expense risk we assume is that the expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policies will exceed those compensated by the administrative charges in the policies if the charge for mortality and expense risks is not sufficient to cover mortality experience and expenses we will absorb the losses if the charge turns out to be higher than mortality and expense risk expenses the difference will be a profit to us if the charge provides us with a profit the profit will be available for our use to pay distribution sales and other expenses administrative charge during the first ten policy years we impose a daily charge at an annual rate of  of the average daily net asset value in each subaccount the charge is to help reimburse us for administrative expenses incurred in the administration of the variable account and the subaccounts it is not expected to be a source of profit the administrative functions and expenses we assume for the variable account and the subaccounts include  clerical accounting actuarial and legal services  rent postage telephone office equipment and supplies  the expenses of preparing and printing registration statements and prospectuses not allocable to sales expense  regulatory filing fees and other fees the company does not impose the variable account administrative charge after the tenth policy year on the tenth policy anniversary the company will convert your units in the subaccounts to units that do not reflect the charge there will be no change in your policy value as a result of the conversion but the number of your units and the corresponding unit values will change other charges and fund expenses the value of the units of the subaccounts will reflect the investment advisory fee and other expenses of the funds whose shares the subaccounts purchase the prospectuses and statements of additional information of the underlying funds contain more information concerning the fees and expenses no charges are currently made against the subaccounts for federal or state income taxes should income taxes be imposed we may make deductions from the subaccounts to pay the taxes see federal tax considerations how is the surrender charge calculated the policys contingent surrender charge is a deferred administrative charge and a deferred sales charge the deferred administrative charge is designed to reimburse us for the administrative costs of product research and development underwriting policy administration and surrendering the policy the deferred sales charge compensates us for distribution expenses including commissions to our representatives advertising and the printing of prospectuses and sales literature we compute the surrender charge on date of issue and on any increase in face amount the surrender charge applies for ten years from date of issue or increase in face amount we impose the surrender charge only if during its duration you request a full surrender or a decrease in face amount the maximum surrender charge includes a  deferred administrative charge of  per thousand dollars of the initial face amount or increase  deferred sales charge of  of

months reaching zero at the end of ten policy years separate surrender charge for each face amount increase payments associated with an increase equal that part of the payments made on or after the increase that are allocated to the increase we allocate payments based on relative guideline annual premium payments for example assume that the guideline annual premium is  before an increase and is  with the increase the policy value on the effective date of the increase would be allocated   to the initial face amount and  to the increase all future payments would also be allocated  to the initial face amount and  to the increase if more than one surrender charge is in effect because of one or more increases in face amount we will apply the surrender charges in inverse order we will apply surrender and partial withdrawal charges described below in this order  first the most recent increase  second the next most recent increases and so on  third the initial face amount possible surrender charge on a face amount decrease a surrender charge may be deducted on a decrease in the face amount on a decrease the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge that would apply to a full surrender the fraction is the product of  the decrease divided by the current face amount times  the surrender charge where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial face amount we will deduct a proportionate share of the surrender charge for that increase or for the initial face amount what charges apply to a partial withdrawal for each partial withdrawal we deduct a transaction fee of  of the amount withdrawn not to exceed  this fee is intended to reimburse us for the cost of processing the withdrawal the transaction fee applies to all partial withdrawals including a withdrawal without a surrender charge described below a partial withdrawal charge may also be deducted from policy value however in any policy year you may withdraw without a partial withdrawal charge up to   of the policy value minus  the total of any prior free withdrawals in the same policy year free  withdrawal the right to make the free  withdrawal is not cumulative from policy year to policy year for example if only  of policy value were withdrawn in the second policy year the amount you could withdraw in future policy years would not be increased by the amount you did not withdraw in the second policy year we impose the partial withdrawal charge on any withdrawal greater than the free  withdrawal the charge is  of the excess withdrawal up to the surrender charge if no surrender charge applies on withdrawal no partial withdrawal charge will apply we will reduce the policys outstanding surrender charge by the partial withdrawal charge deducted proportionately reducing the deferred sales and administrative charges the partial withdrawal charge deducted will decrease existing surrender charges in inverse order what are the transfer charges currently the first  transfers in a policy year are free we reserve the right to limit the number of free transfers in a policy year to six after that we will deduct a  transfer charge from amounts transferred in that policy year we reserve the right to increase the charge but it will never exceed  this charge reimburses us for the administrative paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th costs of processing the transfer if you apply for automatic transfers the first automatic transfer counts as one transfer each future automatic transfer is without charge and does not reduce the

transfers in a policy year  a conversion within the first  months from date of issue or increase  a transfer to the fixed account to secure a loan a reallocation of policy value within  days of the

company for administrative costs associated with the increase this charge is guaranteed not to increase and the company does not expect to make a profit on this charge are there any other administrative charges we reserve the right to charge for other administrative costs we incur while there are no current charges for these costs we may impose a charge for  changing net payment allocation instructions  changing the allocation of monthly insurance protection charges among the various subaccounts and the fixed account  providing a projection of values we do not currently charge for these costs any future charge is guaranteed not to exceed  per transaction does the company waive charges for any classes of policyowners no surrender charges partial withdrawal charges or

the value of the policy on loans withdrawals or surrenders on death benefit payments and on the economic benefit to you or the beneficiary depends upon a variety of factors the following discussion is based upon the companys understanding of the present federal income tax laws as they currently are interpreted from time to time legislation is proposed which if passed could significantly adversely and possibly retroactively affect the taxation of the policy no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws or of current interpretations by the irs moreover no attempt has been made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws it should be recognized that the following summary of federal income tax aspects of amounts received under the policy is not exhaustive does not purport to cover all situations and is not intended as tax advice specifically the discussion below does not address certain tax provisions that may be applicable if the policyowner is a corporation or the trustee of an employee benefit plan a qualified tax adviser always should be consulted with regard to the application of law to individual circumstances how are the company and the variable account taxed the company is taxed as a life insurance company under subchapter l of the code and files a consolidated tax return with its parent and affiliates the company does not expect to incur any income tax upon the earnings or realized capital gains attributable to the variable account based on this no charge is made for federal income taxes which may be attributable to the variable account periodically the company will review the question of a charge to the variable account for federal income taxes such a charge may be made in future years for any federal income taxes incurred by the company this might become necessary if the tax treatment of the company ultimately is determined to be other than what the company believes it to be if there are changes made in the federal income tax treatment of variable life insurance at the company level or if there is a change in the companys tax status any such charge would be designed to cover the federal income taxes attributable to the investment results of the variable account under current laws the company also may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws charges may be made for such taxes paid or reserves for such taxes attributable to the variable account how are the policies taxed the company believes that the policy described in this prospectus will be considered a life insurance contract under section  of the code which generally provides for the taxation of life insurance policies and places limitations on premiums and the relationship of the policy value to the insurance amount at risk as a result the death proceeds payable are excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary moreover any increase in the policy value is not taxable until received by the policyowner or the policyowners designee however if a policy fails to qualify as life insurance under section  the policy will not provide most of the tax advantages normally provided by life insurance the company reserves the right to amend the policies to comply with any future changes in the code any regulations or rulings under the code and any other requirements imposed by the internal revenue service what are modified endowment policies and how are they taxed below depending upon the circumstances a surrender partial withdrawal change in the sum insured option change in the face amount lapse with policy loan outstanding or assignment of the policy may have tax consequences in particular under specified conditions a distribution under the policy during the first  years from date of issue that reduces future benefits under the policy will be taxed to the policyowner as ordinary income to the extent of any investment earnings in the policy federal state and local income estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each insured policyowner or beneficiary if you surrender the policy you are subject to income tax on the portion of the distribution that exceeds the investment in the contract the investment in the contract is the gross premiums paid for the policy minus any amounts previously received from the policy if such amounts were properly excluded from your gross income policy loans are generally not treated as taxable distributions interest paid on a policy loan is generally not deductible you are generally taxed on partial withdrawals to the extent the paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th amount distributed exceeds the investment in the contract in certain situations partial withdrawals or reduction in benefits during the first fifteen years of the policy may result in a taxable distribution before the investment in the contract is recovered withdrawals and loans from modified endowment contracts are subject to less favorable tax treatment for an additional discussion of modified endowment contracts please see what are modified endowment policies and how are they taxed below if the death benefit is not received in a lump sum but is instead applied under one of the settlement options payments generally will be prorated between amounts attributable to the death benefit which will be excludable from the beneficiarys income and amounts attributable to interest occurring after the insureds death which will be includable in the beneficiarys income if you are owner and insured under the policy the death benefit will be included in your gross estate for federal estate tax purposes even if the insured is not the owner but retains incidents of ownership in the policy the death benefit will also be included in the insureds gross estate examples of incidents of ownership include the right to  change beneficiaries  assign the policy  revoke an assignment  pledge the policy or  obtain a policy loan if you are owner and insured under the policy and you transfer all incidents of ownership in the policy the death benefit will be included in your gross estate if you die within three years from the date of the ownership transfer state and local estate and inheritance taxes may also apply in addition certain transfers of the policy or death benefit either during life or at death to individuals two or more generations below the transferor may be subject to the federal generation skipping transfer tax this rule also applies if the transfer is to a trust for the benefit of individuals two or more generations below the transferor the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement if you are contemplating the use of a policy in any of these arrangements you should consult a qualified tax adviser regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement how are policy loans taxed the company believes that nonpreferred loans received under the policy will be treated as an indebtedness of the policyowner for federal income tax purposes under current law these loans will not constitute income for the policyowner while the policy is in force but see modified endowment policies there is a risk however that a preferred loan may be characterized by the irs as a withdrawal and taxed accordingly at the present time the irs has not issued any guidance on whether loans with the attributes of a preferred loan should be treated differently than a nonpreferred loan this lack of specific guidance makes the tax treatment of preferred loans uncertain in the event pertinent irs guidelines are issued in the future you may convert your preferred loan to a nonpreferred loan however it is possible that notwithstanding the conversion some or all of the loan could be treated as a taxable distribution from the policy section  of the code restricts the deduction of interest on policy loans consumer interest paid on policy loans under an individually owned policy is not tax deductible no tax deduction for interest is allowed on policy loans exceeding  in the aggregate if the insured is an officer or employee of or is financially interested in any business carried on by the taxpayer there is an exception to this rule which permits a deduction for interest on loans up to  related to any businessowned policies covering officers or percent owners up to a maximum equal to the greater of  five individuals or  the lesser of a  of the total number of officers and employees of the corporation or b  individuals policies issued in connection with tsa plans the policies may be issued in connection with taxsheltered annuity plans tsa plans of certain public school paposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st systems and organizations that are tax exempt under section c of the code under the provisions of section b of the code payments made for annuity policies purchased for employees under tsa plans are excludable from the gross income of such employees to the extent that the aggregate purchase payments in any year do not exceed the maximum contribution permitted under the code the company has received a private letter ruling with respect to the status of the policies as providing incidental life insurance when issued in connection with tsa plans in the private letter ruling the irs has taken the position that the purchase of a life insurance policy by the employer as part of a tsa plan will not violate the incidental benefit rules of section b and the regulations thereunder the private letter ruling also stated that the use of current or accumulated contributions to purchase a life insurance policy will not result in current taxation of the premium payments for the life insurance policy except for the current cost of the life insurance protection a policy qualifying under section b of the code must provide that withdrawals or other distributions attributable to salary reduction contributions including earnings may not begin before the employee attains age   separates from service dies or becomes disabled in the case of hardship a policyowner may withdraw amounts contributed by salary reduction but not the earnings on such amounts even though a distribution may be permitted under these rules eg for hardship or after separation from service it may nonetheless be subject to a  penalty tax as a premature distribution in addition to income tax policy loans are generally permitted in accordance with the terms of the policy however if a policy loan does not comply with the requirements of code section p the policyowners tsa plan may become disqualified and policy values may be includible in current income what are modified endowment policies and how are they taxed the technical and miscellaneous revenue act of  the  act adversely affects the tax treatment of distributions under socalled modified endowment contracts a life insurance policy is treated as a modified endowment contract under section a of the code if it meets the definition of life inusrance in section  but tfails the sevenpay test of section a the policy would fail to satisfy the sevenpay test if the cumulative premiums paid under the policy at any time during the first seven policy years or within seven years of a material change in the policy exceed the sum of the net level premiums that would have been paid had the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums in addition if benefits are reduced at anytime during the life of the policy there may be adverse tax consequences please consult your tax adviser if the policy is considered a modified endowment contract the death benefit will still qualify for the exclusion from gross income and increases in policyt value are not subject to current taxation unless withdrawn or otherwise accessed however all distributions under the policy will be taxed on an incomefirst basis most distributions received by the policyowner directly or indirectly including loans withdrawals surrenders or the assignment or pledge of any portion of the policy value will be includible in gross income to the extent that the cash surrender value of the policy exceeds the policyowners investment in the policy any additional amounts will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the policyowners basis in the policy with certain exceptions an additional  tax will be imposed on the portion of any distribution that is includible in income all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurance company to the same policyowner during any calendar period will be treated as a single modified endowment contract in determining taxable distributions currently each policy is reviewed when premiums are received to determine if it satisfies the sevenpay test if the policy does not satisfy the sevenpay test the company will notify the policyowner of the option of requesting a refund of the excess premium the refund process must be completed within  days after the policy anniversary or the policy will be classified permanently as a modified endowment contract what are the diversification requirements for the variable account the code also requires that the investment of each subaccount be adequately diversified in accordance with treasury regulations in order to be treated as a life insurance policy for tax purposes although the company does not have control over the investments of the funds the company believes that the funds currently meet the treasurys diversification requirements and the company will monitor continued compliance with these requirements in connection with the issuance of previous regulations relating to diversification requirements the treasury department paposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd announced that such regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to which policyowners may direct their investments to particular divisions of a separate account regulations in this regard may be issued in the future it is possible that if and when regulations are issued the policy may need to be modified to comply with such regulations for these reasons the policy or the companys administrative rules may be modified as necessary to prevent a policyowner from being considered the owner of the assets of the variable account can i be considered the owner of the variable account assets for tax purposes the irs has stated that you will be considered the owner of variable account assets if you possess incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets at the time the diversification regulations were issued the treasury department announced that the regulations do not provide guidance concerning circumstances in which investor control of the variable account investments may cause an investor to be treated as the owner of the variable account the treasury department also stated that future guidance would be issued regarding the extent that owners could direct subaccount investments without being treated as owners of the underlying assets of the variable account your rights under this policy are different than those described by the irs in rulings in which it found that contract owners were not owners of variable account assets for example you have the choice to allocate premiums and policy values among more investment options in addition you may be able to transfer among investment options more frequently than in such rulings these differences could result in you being treated as the owner of the variable account if this occurs income and gain from the variable account assets would be includible in your gross income the company does not know what standards will be set forth in any regulations or rulings that the treasury department may issue it is possible that future standards announced by the treasury department could adversely affect the tax treatment of your contract we reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the federal tax owner of the assets of the variable account however we make no guarantee that such modification to the policy will be successful other information are there other important policy provisions the following policy provisions may vary in certain states in order to comply with requirements of the insurance laws regulations and insurance regulatory agencies in those states policyowner the policyowner is the insured unless another policyowner has been named in the application for the policy the policyowner generally is entitled to exercise all rights under the policy while the insured is alive subject to the consent of any irrevocable beneficiary the consent of a revocable beneficiary is not required the consent of the insured is required whenever the face amount of insurance is increased beneficiary the beneficiary is the person or persons to whom the insurance proceeds are payable upon the insureds death unless otherwise stated in the policy the beneficiary has no rights in the policy before the death of the insured while the insured is alive you may change any beneficiary unless you have declared a beneficiary to be irrevocable if no beneficiary is alive when the insured dies the policyowner or the policyowners estate will be the beneficiary if more than one beneficiary is alive when the insured dies they will be paid in equal shares unless you have chosen otherwise where there is more than one beneficiary the interest of a beneficiary who dies before the insured will pass to surviving beneficiaries proportionally unless otherwise requested incontestability the company will not contest the validity of the policy after it has been in force during the insureds lifetime for two years from the date

greater of the  face amount plus policy value or  guideline minimum sum insured under both the level option and adjustable option the death benefit provides insurance protection under the level option the death benefit is level unless the guideline minimum sum insured exceeds the face amount then the death benefit varies as the policy value changes under the adjustable option the death benefit always varies as the policy value changes at any face amount the death benefit will be greater under the adjustable option than under the level option because the policy value is added to the face amount and included in the death benefit however the monthly insurance protection charge will be greater therefore policy value will accumulate at a slower rate than under the level option if you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected in the death benefit you should choose the adjustable option if you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the policy value you should select the level option guideline minimum sum insured the guideline minimum sum insured is a percentage of the policy value as set forth in the table

and the printing of prospectuses and sales literature we compute the surrender charge on date of issue and on any increase in face amount the surrender charge applies for ten years from date of issue or increase in face amount we impose the surrender charge only if during its duration you request a full surrender or a decrease in face amount the maximum surrender charge includes a  deferred administrative charge of  per thousand dollars of the initial face amount or increase  deferred sales charge of  of payments received or associated with the increase up to the guideline annual premium

first  policy months and then reduces by th for the next  policy months reaching zero at the end of ten policy years payments associated with an increase equal that part of the payments made on or after the increase that are allocated to the increase we allocate payments based on relative guideline annual premium payments for example assume that the guideline annual premium is  before an increase and is  with the increase the policy value on the effective date of the increase would be allocated   to the initial face amount and  to the increase all future payments would also be allocated  to the initial face amount and  to the increase if more than one surrender charge is in effect because of one or more increases in face amount we will apply the surrender charges in inverse order we will apply surrender and partial withdrawal charges described below in this order  first the most recent increase  second the next most recent increases and so on  third the initial face amount a surrender charge may be deducted on a decrease in the face amount on a decrease the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge that would apply to a full surrender the fraction is the product of  the decrease divided by the current face amount times  the surrender charge where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial face amount we will deduct a proportionate share of the surrender charge for that increase or for the initial face amount calculation of maximum surrender charges a separate surrender charge is computed on the date of issue and

offered will be calculated as if the policies had been offered during that period of time with all charges assumed to be those applicable to the subaccounts and the funds the returns in the tables reflect the charges assessed against the separate account eg the mortality and expense risk charge and the administration charge and all charges and expenses of the underlying funds however the payment expense charge the charges that vary with each policy because they are based on certain factors that vary with the individual characteristics of the insured eg the monthly deduction and surrender charges and transaction charges are not reflected in the rates of return shown below if these charges were deducted the returns in the tables would have been significantly lower the tables do not illustrate how investment performance of the underlying funds will affect policy values and benefits because they do not reflect deduction of all applicable policy charges total return and average annual total return are based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance total return is the total income generated net of certain expenses and charges in each table below oneyear total return refers to the total of the income generated by a subaccount based on certain charges and assumptions as described in the respective tables for the oneyear period ended december   average annual total return is based on the same charges and assumptions but reflects the hypothetical annually compounded return that would have produced the same cumulative return if the subaccounts performance had been constant over the entire period because average annual total returns tend to smooth out variations in annual performance return they are not the same as actual yearbyyear results performance information for any subaccount reflects only the performance of a hypothetical investment in the subaccount during a period it is not representative of what may be

money annuity types home annuity resources annuity types fixed and variable annuities a fixed annuity is a type of annuity where the issuer usually a life insurance company guarantees both the principal and interest rate over the lifetime of the annuity when an individual purchases fixed annuities they know exactly how much they will be paid back at what increments and for how long a variable annuity is based upon an investment in a mutual fund that is generally managed by the issuing company just as with a typical mutual fund variable annuities pay according to the performance of the investment and the payments are not guaranteed by the company there are a few types of annuites that have characteristics of both fixed and variable annuities equity indexed annuities are on example of this as with a fixed annuity they provide a guaranteed interest rate of return however because they are tied to an equity portfolio like a variable annuity they may pay a higher rate of return based upon the performance of the fund special types of annuities while all annuities can be classified as fixed or variable there are many types of annuity products that can fall into either one of these categories following is a list of the major types of annuities on the market today qualified and nonqualified annuities a qualified annuity is simply an annuity that is purchased through a taxdeferred retirement account such as a k with qualified annuities the purchaser is able to deduct the premiums from their taxable income at the time of the contribution since these are tax deductible they are frequently referred to as tax sheltered annuities a nonqualified annuity just means that it was not purchased via a taxdeferred retirement savings program with nonqualified annuities the purchaser receives no tax savings and must also pay tax on any interest income earned upon withdrawal deferred and immediate annuities with deferred annuities the purchaser receives no payment at the time the annuity is purchased instead deferred annuities begin to yield payments only after some time period has past often many years an immediate annuity includes payments right after the policy is purchased in other words when someone buys immediate annuities payments will be issued in the next period after it was purchased usually just a month later lifetime and fixed period annuities with lifetime annuities sometimes called life annuities the payout is made to the beneficiary until they die no matter how long with term certain annuities on the other hand payouts are only made for a specified period of time and then they stop for example fixed period annuities may specify that payments will be made for exactly  years and no more regardless of how long the beneficary lives flexible and single premium annuities a flexible premium annuities are ones that requires the purchaser to make many payments over a period of time these are often referred to as multipayment annuities conversely single pay annuities are ones that require the purchaser to make a lump sum payment at the beginning for example with single premium annuities the purchaser might be required to invest an initial  all at once and then they would receive payments in return over the specified annuity period additional annuity types there are several lesscommon types of annuities that are not

annuities home annuity resources annuity types life annuities annuities and life annuities are plans through which an individual pays a lump sum of money to be invested by the annuity company and payments are sent back to the annuity holder over a set period of time life annuities are typically purchased by retirees to maximize yearly income and gain returns on investments without having to manage those investments how life annuities work annuities can be thought of as loan reversals where the individual pays a large sum of money to a company and the company pays back that loan with interest over a period of time life annuities are defined as plans in which an individual pays a set sum and then receives annual payments over a decided period of time during the individual’s life annuities are designed to provide a predetermined yearly income to the life annuity holder once the annuity has been established individuals can either pay into the annuity fund during their working years or pay a large sum from a previously established account once they are close to retirement once purchased the cost of a life annuity plan is used to purchase stocks bonds and other investments that typically provide high returns over long periods of time this accumulated interest is used to help support the life annuity payments life annuity interest interest accumulated on the amount invested in the life annuity is taxexempt until payments on the annuity are paid back to the investor once the withdraw period begins the investments are taxed most companies selling life annuities have life annuity plans that have set payments that end as soon as the annuity holder dies no payments are made to survivors or beneficiaries and any remaining investment is retained by the company life annuity payments are usually calculated based on the average lifetime of an individual if an individual lives beyond this calculated time then the individual may end up being paid more money than he or she paid into the system there are however riders that can be attached to life annuity plans although typical life annuities will pay the annuity holder until time of death there are also riders that can be added onto the contract to assure of others receiving the annuities some of these options include life with period certain – payment is received by the individual until death but with a provision that states that if the individual dies within a certain period of time the beneficiaries will then receive payments through a predetermined period installment – refund – guarantees that after death whatever is left in the annuity fund will be paid to the beneficiaries joint and survivor – in cases of spouses the annuity pays out beyond the death of the spouse who owns the annuity the annuity will pay the surviving spouse until death life annuity plans can be tailored to each individual initial payments and total costs of annuities vary as well as the amounts paid out over time the annual payments back to the annuity holder can vary in both amount of money as well as the frequency the number of payments in a given period of time individuals can decide on how much is paid to them each time or how frequently payments are made typically they cannot choose both once payment options are chosen however they cannot be changed size of payments depend on total amount of money in the annuity contract whether there are minimum required payments life expectancy of the individual payment into an annuity can happen over period of time or the life annuity can be purchased in on lump sum some payment options into a life annuity are singlepremium annuities – purchase of annuity with one lump sum flexiblepremium annuities – purchase of an annuity is made through a series of payments payments from an annuity can also take on variables some annuities can defer payment until a later date while others begin payment out immediately some payments to the annuity holder can include immediate annuity – begins payment to the annuity holder immediately after purchase of annuity contract deferred annuity – payments to the annuity holder begin many years after the contract begins this can be good for individuals who wish to extend their income far beyond retirement fixed annuities – the annuity company puts funds into investment and guarantees a certain interest rate over a certain period of time from months to years variable annuity – there is no fixed interest rate and more risk in investment with the annuity fund frequency of payments and amount of money in each payment during the payout period can also vary in life annuities some options are fixed amount – gives the annuity holder a fixed amount of income each month chosen by the individual this payment is constant until the annuity runs out fixed period – gives the annuity holder a fixed income over a period of time chosen by the individual the longer the period the less payout per period of time

fixed period annuities an annuity is a contract purchased with a sum of money to provide the buyer or annuitant with regular payments in return annuities work like loans in reverse in that an individual purchases the annuity for a sum of money the purchase price and in return receives annuity payments which contain interest over time in return the company pays back the sum of money over a period of time plus some interest typically taxes are deferred on annuities until the payments are made to the annuitant how fixed period annuities work annuities can vary in amounts paid frequency of payments and time periods over which the payments are made under some circumstances an individual annuitant can decide either how much is paid in each payment or the period of time over which payments are made since the total sum of money is usually decided upon by the amount paid into an annuity a shorter fixed period annuity would typically have larger payments to the annuitant than a longer fixed period annuity if the individual decides on how much is paid to him or her with each payment than larger sums would usually mean a shorter period of payment and a choice of smaller sums would occur over a longer period of time some annuities can pay out over the lifetime of the individual fixed period annuities are annuities where the individual annuitant or ownerpurchaser of the annuity chooses the amount of time over which the annuity is paid back fixed annuities pay a fixed amount over a fixed period of time chosen by the annuitant the amount of time is usually a function of many years such as ten or fifteen years during which annual biannual or monthly payments are made to the annuitant fixed period annuities are typically sold in the following categories year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of five years year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of ten years year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of fifteen years year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of twenty years fixed period annuities are usually chosen to cover a period of time during which no other
