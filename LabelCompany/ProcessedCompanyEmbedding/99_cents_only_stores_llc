to more than  extreme value retail stores in california texas arizona and nevada history cents only stores dates back to the ’s when the company’s founder dave gold inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown los angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed pricepoint of  cents the test was instant success and dave thought that selling everything in the store for  cents would be hugely popularhe finally put this idea to work in  when he spotted a building for lease and decided it would be a great location for the first  cents only storeson “lucky” friday the th of august in  dave and sherry gold opened the first  cents only store in los angeles to celebrate the grand opening dave decided to sell television sets for only  cents to the store’s first  customers more than  people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open the huge line caught the media’s attention and more than  tv outlets covered the store’s first day the success of this first grand opening inspired a tradition that continues today with every new store offering incredible cent deals for televisions and other exciting productsover the years the company grew with new stores in california and after the company went public in   cents only stores began opening locations in new markets including arizona nevada and texas cents only stores secured its place in history and as an iconic american institution when the famous german photographer andreas gursky captured a worldrenowned image of the inside of the  cents only store in hollywood in  that picture was featured at the museum of modern art in new york city and was later auctioned off by sotheby’s for more than  million setting the alltime sales price record for a photographwith more than  stores in four states and two distribution centers in california and texas  cents only stores became the leading extreme value retail chain in the western united states marked a turning point for the company when it celebrated its th anniversary and decided to go private by partnering with ares management and the canadian pension plan investment board  this partnership has been instrumental in the company’s continued expansion both in the number of new stores and new markets it’s an exciting time at  cents only stores we’re opening new stores and arriving in new markets to ensure we provide our customers

they say it tastes just like a mangonada and serving size is similarly one for that three bite morsel packed with calories and sugar take slow bites and savor that salty spicy flavor ill be honest i was just here for candy i found haribo gummy bears both single bag and individually wrapped treat bags  go here for piñata stuffers lots of tootsie pops blow pops bubble gum etc lots of brand name candy and mints at the counters too staff is friendly they do sell produce not sure if its gmo though this store rocks the employees are really friendly and helpful alex d jason and all of the rest are doing an excellent job this is my favorite store for produce especially artichokes and avocados fresh bread of all kinds on my social security income this is excellent this store will save i money they have everything u need groceries alcohol and all life necessities great store fully equipped with just about everything you need for just about anything always fresh bread and produce every single staff is kind and courteous and the store manager alex p does a wonderful job at making sure the store is kept tidy and in orderi go here almost everyday for something okso i knew the  cent stores existed and people shop there however i didnt really get into it until my good friend took me to the store in san leandro it was huge and had groceries ummmgroceries as in fruits and veggies milk eggs deli meats and snacks wow ok you got me  cent i decided to try out this location and saw the lack of reviews why not add one more the store itself was kept clean and stocked its like any other groceries stores just without the bakery butcher and the occasional starbucks however the added bonus is that probably  of the items are  cents you will find some items in the  range i havent seen anything over  those items are usually bulk tp eggs or milk still if youre under a budget thats mega savings and yes you will find brand names at the  cents store oh this storecarries wine if youre a wine drinker on todays visit i spent  and guess how many items i left the store with guess  items i bought  gigantic green mangos for  cents each if i was at safeway they would have cost  each and half the size my receipt for this same purchase would have been somewhere between  at safeway i guess you can agree that im a fan of this  cent only stores location and san leandros in general i love  cent only stores including this one in fremont i shopped pretty much every other few days in this store there are few things that you have to get yourself familiar with if you shop in  cent only stores their stuffs usually are in low quality you get what you pay for so this is a nonissue to me another thing to look out is their return policies in general their stuffs is returnable within  days but sometimes they have very vague policies on the terms of seasonal items i have trouble returning christmas gift cards to the store even the store manager had promised me i would have no problem returning it and they just denied my returns and the manager was never show up in the store every time i went visiting the cashiers and head of cashiers took my phone information three times and told me they would have the store manager to contact me but no one gave me any reply after the first two times i went there there was this hispanic dude that kinda lead the store told me the manager was not there so he asked me to leave me my information i did but no follow up i went there the rd time the cashier jason the head of cashier joraliza i hope i spelt it correctly did the same thing and no one follow up after so in general dont trust what their cashiers would told you because they dont care and they wouldnt be able to help you while you have problems they always referred you to the store manger who just never showed up in the store i like a good bargain when i see it with that said ill gladly take the  cent store over safeway whole foods trader joes anyday this store has some great items ranging from snack items too frozen foods in terms of candy they got all the nestle brands and russell stovers to name a few i recently purchased stoufers buffalo mac cheese cheese cups silk brand cashew milk and progresso pasta bowls some of the items you find at this store are actually hard to find at the bigger chains my only issue is that items constantly change one week your find what you want and the next that item is no more on display for this reason i hoard upon my favorite snacks and grab more than  just to be safe one thing to keep in mind when shopping here is too look at the expiration date ive seen some dairy products that expired over a year ago but was still on the shelf impressive store good verity fresh foods have great prices my husband worked food stores and hes pleased always go for treats they beat movie theater prices corn nuts peanuts and the like are fresh everyday items are plentiful try it out in love with this store relatively clean for a store of this type great savings and quality love to buy producefrozen foodssnacksspicesmonster energy drinksbrand name makeupand brand name toys here i remember when this was a safeway then a smart  final first impression  packed with stuff most of the stuff was brands i didnt recognize  thats ok theres a little of everything wont be in my regular rotation but ill stop when nearby love this store we always have great experiences here as far as staff customers meh theyre rude oh well we get great deals i can deal with the azzholes because the employees  mgrs are fantastic especially alex d awesome manager she is personable and very likeable i will continue to shop here as long as it doesnt change and get stupid   cents only store actually sells most items for they usually have more snack items available then dollar tree line was long until  more cashiers were called up front buys white chocolate flavored pringles artifically flavored tasty pop corners ny based tastier than popchips got kettle cheesy jalapeno white cheddar chili crumbs parking lot full when i went to purchase my items it seems that someone put an empty open scissor container  like someone stole the item inside but left behind the plastic outline and barcode backing attached in my bag and had me pay for it i didnt realize it until i checked my bag and noticed the empty item package and that i was also charged on my receipt i was obviously too busy getting my card out to pay  but seriously how does the cashier not notice an empty plastic thing and still decide to process it through disappointing this is by far the best  cent store in fremont or any other place i have been to the selection is enormous watermelons epsom salt hats earphones towels wine usually  milk  a gallon bacon chicken potato chips it is entirely possible to get all your household good here but there is also quite a lot of cheap junk despite that unlike most  cent stores you can find a lot of merchandise that goes for  or more at other stores i have seen oz tins of wild salmon large artichokes and  pound watermelons went to this  cents only store since it was across the street from green champa garden got a bunch of stuff halsa pocket pack facial tissue pack of ply tissues bath wipes  good for camping with no showers tuna w crackers  grapefruits prebagged charged it i couldnt my eyes when i walked into this store nearly everything was  they sell a lot of random knick knacks and generic looking groceries for  too i even saw brand name sun screen for  i was blown away by their variety of random cheap goodies i go to their ig page and see that they always have good and new stuff and to my surprise its good stuff like golden peak tea and more i dont come here often but when i do i always leave with a bag full of goodies i even bought flip flops for  lol they have everything it seems im excited to come back here because its hard to say no to cheap goodies and groceries lol store is clean and not cheap looking kinda reminds me of big lots but cheaper because almost everything is  i am a huge fan and i wish they would expand and have more locations i know that some location even carry organic groceries cant beat that found this place in fremont went in to check it out an buy some reading glasses jack pot bought  pair the place is very clean  organized i even bought produce  rasberries box great little place in fremont they have a good selection of veggies and fruits here sometimes their veggies and fruits rotate so if i was specifically looking for something i wouldnt count on them to have it  of the time they have started selling milk here not for  though so if i need i can get some here there is always a steady stream of customers coming in and out the checkout is quick and the cashiers are friendly parking is usually not a problem this is a basic  cent store relatively small and somewhat cluttered and unkept feeling i dont want to totally hammer the place because there are some nice little snags here and there just dont expect diamond in the rough lifetime merchandise here i find it quite nice to run over to the store and pick up some big size candy boxes of candy they have lots of candy that is cheap and its great i shall continue to patron this store  cents only stores claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative

general their stuffs is returnable within  days but sometimes they have very vague policies on the terms of seasonal itemsi have trouble returning christmas gift cards to the store even the store manager had promised me i would have no problem returning it and they just denied my returns and the manager was never show up in the store every time i went visitingthe cashiers and head of cashiers took my phone information three times and told me they would have the store manager to contact me but no one gave me any reply after the first two times i went there there was this hispanic dude that kinda lead the store told me the manager was not there so he asked me to leave me my information i did but no follow up i went there the rd time the cashier jason the head of cashier joraliza i hope i spelt it correctly did the same thing and no one follow up afterso in general dont trust what their cashiers would told you because they dont care and they wouldnt be able to help you while you have problems they always referred you to the store manger who just never showed up in the store was this review … useful  funny  cool avni s sunnyvale ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed

extra cash at another store than have to hear those things especially my child to be exposed to that behavior shame on you and your employee yeah you can find some deals at this store however not always some things you are paying over price since they may be a little bit cheaper somewhere else also sooner or later they are going to have to change the name of the store to  cent plus or  cents

are   and seen things that cost up to  so the thank you for shopping at  cents only store slogan has to go also the parking can be a pain since its a small lot and the store isnt as big like the gilroy location but yet its a good store if you like to save money either you get what you paid for or you just found some awesome deals this store is x more awesome than the dollar tree or any other dollar store ive been too they even have groceries of course there are some things you could find cheaper than here somewhere else if you know the coupon life this is officially my favorite  cent store there were a some things that i thought was inconvenient and if youre planning to go here you should be aware  the road theres a median along the main road the is only accessible by one way although if you are going eastbound from stevens creek theres a left turn you could use but if youre planning to go eastbound coming out of the store you have to make a uturn  small parking lot you have to circle around a couple times or wait for someone to pull out to park another option is to street park somewhere nearby and walk there  long lines when i went here there were only two open registers when there were over  people waiting and these people buy in bulk so you could see everyones frustration what i like about this is that you get what you pay for you can honestly save money here especially if youre looking for cleaning supplies snacks and groceries i live in south san jose and sometimes stop here when i am in the area doesnt make cents to travel  miles to buy one thing for those who are looking for bargains this is the place my first time in a  cents only store was in victorville a much larger location than this one when i first saw the selection i thought it was too good to be true and discovered it isnt much like harbor freight tools there are amazing deals to be had here stay away from things that are questionable however like in any discount store this store is the only  cents only store in san jose the best bargains i found here are  liters of pepsi products for c gasket sealant hardware bungee cords and certain housewares i have found better value and selection here compared to dollar tree plus theres no limit on the c liter pepsi do go during nonpeak times the timeframe i have visited this store is friday night an hour before closing and the parking and lines are reasonable do shop  cents only first provided your arent going out of your way for a can of soup do buy pepsi products here if youre a pepsi drinker dear michelle thank you for reaching out to me i dont think there if you can really improve since the female workers are always in cohorts with one another the male employees are very nice and take their job seriously  i hope things will work out for your store  thanks unprofessional folks   weeks back we asked a store representative if they fill helium air for balloons bought from other store and the person replied yes stating different pricing models we called today to confirm the same and we were told same information however when we took our balloons the person there replied that they dont do external balloons and this has been  year policy moreover the response was in rude and unprofessional manner so we have  issues with this store  rude staff  inconsistent information amongst different employees of same store we will never buy anything from this store again  overall experience not bad at all the staff are friendly i admire one of the staff who worked at a cashier i wish i remember her name she was a very positive person she works  or  jobs and just everything with a smile wish more people are like this especially hard time here living here in the bay area one thing i wish you guys had more items like more newer products for the toys or cosmetic section great store you can find so many different things here all for  or under i stocked up on cleaning supplies office supplies and even found some great food things to take home and make a salad with seriously they have soooo much stuff this place is great i would give them a  star but some of the produce wasquestionable i am not sure if they have the proper cooling system and it seemed like some of the veggies that were supposed to be crisp were limp and soft this is definitely a place where you have to keep your eyes peeled there is so much to look at it is worth it going down each isle you never know what great deal you will find i will be back i enjoy coming to this store i love there products like there lime bags candy selection produce and so on they have the actual name brand chips and drinks and not select like other stores which ever holiday thats near they always have items covers and chargers for your iphones you name it they have it parking maybe be a hassle sometimes not everything is  anymore make sure you ask the cashier at the register if your not sure a hidden gem so i always come to use the bathroom while shopping down the street at crossroads trading co and had a craving for some gum while the bathroom is quite nasty it works i ventured into the store in search of some chicle gum and holy smokes not only did this place have one of the most extensive candy aisles i have ever seen but also party planning supplies air fresheners toilet items and even a substantial array of groceries including fruits veggies and get thischobani yogurt also the people at the counter are actually surprisingly friendly the woman was quite entertained by my yammering about my fascination with the one cent tax on gum apparently it is considered a foodummmm yah i will have to talk to the gov about that one while i dont think i would shop here on a regular basis it is dirt cheap and perfect for planning a party plus its just fun to scour the aisles to see what you can get in summary come here for party planning if you need a few cheap random groceries or for funsies its a discount store dont expect service like youre shopping at nordstrom or some other place for the price and selection this place is really nice know your prices for goods though not everything you can buy here is worth it also be sure to check the exp dates on any food items you are buying the store itself is always packed with goodies and is nice and clean seriously amazing i mainly come here for the incredibly cheap produce but i always leave with all kinds of stuff including home goods and small toys i cant believe the deals every time i leave i feel like i robbed the place p people complain about the parking and long lines its a very small price to pay just like the price for all the goods you take home not the greatest dollar store but just okay they oddly sell food and candy here and they definitely look old or unappetizing the products they have are okay but you cant find much they have party beauty car accessories and all that here but i leave empty handed this place is great groceries toiletries school supplies kitchen tools car tools cleaning supplies party supplies etc etc they have it all and all for  cents what i like to prep for when shtf shit hits the fan so i like to stock up on tp paper towels bar soap dish soap canned foods trash bags pain pills etc but i like to do so in a cheap manner lol because when shit doesnt hit the fan i didnt shell out too much  and when it does i plan to survive it with my stock pile and ar harhar what can you say about stuff for a dollar good deal even though they do stuff now like milk produce and oil etc thats more than  lots of stuff to choose from but they dont restock organize or clean well the thing that i knotice most is people hate that there are always lines they never have enough people working its no wonder things get stolen from there all the timeyou see the open packages all over every day i love when i come out to california and can come here for my cheap apartment stuff so when i leave i can just pitch it the area the store is located in is not the best the parking lot is terrible not greatly lit and totally grossthere is a lady that is out there selling tamalesand people just strolling the parking lot inside the storeits a discount storenot saksi like that they have a food sectionlook at expiration dates though the red headed guy that works in there looks like he is super not happy to be at work go to another lane if you can  no no no a thousand times no the lines are way too long here and it takes forever to check out  not on what would presumably be peak hours like the weekend i went at  pm on a wednesday and the wait time was ridiculous the small cramped parking lot cannot accommodate all the customers i witnessed two people getting into it over a parking space the selection is comparable to dollar tree but id say dollar tree is slightly better do yourself a favor and go there  cents only stores claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews

only store in san jose the best bargains i found here are  liters of pepsi products for c gasket sealant hardware bungee cords and certain housewares i have found better value and selection here compared to dollar tree plus theres no limit on the c liter pepsi do go during nonpeak times the timeframe i have visited this store is friday night an hour before closing and the parking and lines are reasonable do shop  cents only first provided your arent going out of your way for a can of soup do buy pepsi products here if youre a pepsi drinker was this review … useful  funny cool tim p san

review events talk log in     mission blvdhayward ca    the name of the store isnt truthful there are some items in here that are over  cents but theyre always clearly marked so there should be no confusion i wish i lived closer because this is one of the better  cents stores out there theres cooler things here than at the dollar tree and maybe even daiso i havent been here in a long time and was surprised that i walked out with so many things they had ontrend items like bandanas puffy keychains infinity scarves and all that what was really weird is they had boxes of maybelline makeup for only  cents theyre not old products either its the same ones that are sold for  at drugstores a lot of the items were broken but i dug in and found a highlighter in brand new condition the real highlight here is the produce section they have plantains tomatoes avocados and more for super cheap prices they also carry organic soy and almond milk its worth coming back here if youre trying to

this is one of the better  cents stores out there theres cooler things here than at the dollar tree and maybe even daisoi havent been here in a long time and was surprised that i walked out with so many things they had ontrend items like bandanas puffy keychains infinity scarves and all that what was really weird is they had boxes of maybelline makeup for only  cents theyre not old products either its the same ones that are sold for  at drugstores a lot of the items were broken but i dug in and found a highlighter in brand new conditionthe real highlight here is the produce section they have plantains tomatoes avocados and more for super cheap prices they also carry organic soy and almond milk its worth coming back here if youre trying to eat healthy on a budget they also have a good

samestore sales increased by  net loss was  million compared to net loss of  million in prior year adjusted ebitda was  million compared to  million in prior year  cents only stores llc the company announced its financial results for second quarter of fiscal  ended july   geoffrey covert president and chief executive officer stated i remain encouraged by our progress in executing our turnaround plan with measurable improvement this past quarter we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of fiscal  progress is evident across many aspects of the enterprise and our improved sales performance provides an indication that our plan is taking hold  during the second quarter samestore sales were positive  and on a year to date basis same store sales improved to positive  in addition total inventory as of the end of the second quarter was  million down nearly  million from  million as of the end of the second quarter last year  finally our improved sales performance and lower inventory levels have collectively strengthened our liquidity position  cash borrowings under our abl facility are now the lowest they have been in the past two years as of the end of the second quarter cash borrowings under our abl facility were  million down  million compared to the prior quarter end and down  million from a year ago mr covert concluded since beginning our turnaround plan in the third quarter last year we have maintained that it will take time to operationally address our key issues—and even longer for the changes we are making to be fully reflected in our financial results  however based on the results of the first half of fiscal  i am optimistic that we remain ontrack to return  cents only stores to sustained growth in the longrun  second quarter financial results for the second quarter of fiscal  the companys net sales increased  to  million compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  samestore sales increased  compared to the second quarter of fiscal  with higher customer traffic of  offset by lower average ticket of  positives in samestore sales included higher sales in produce consumables and grocery as a result of improved product availability and higher instock levels due to improvements in the allocation and replenishment system and the expansion of the companys partnership with a third party produce distributor challenges in samestore sales included lower seasonal sales due to the overlapping of significant inventory purchases in fiscal  which increased sales but led to excess inventory levels in stores and prompted ongoing initiatives to clear excess onhand seasonal inventory through promotions and markdowns in addition persistent price deflation in dairy negatively impacted sales of milk and eggs gross margin as a percentage of net sales was  in the second quarter of fiscal  an increase of  basis points from the second quarter of fiscal  gross margin was higher due to lower inventory shrinkage that was primarily driven by a favorable comparison against the second quarter of last year when the shrink provision rate was increased to better reflect the unfavorable physical inventory counts completed during the quarter this was partially offset by higher distribution and transportation expenses during the second quarter of fiscal  product margin was flat compared to second quarter of fiscal  selling general and administrative expenses were  million or  as a percentage of net sales representing an increase of  basis points from the second quarter of fiscal  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by an increase in the california minimum wage net loss was  million in the second quarter of fiscal  compared to net loss

how does forming an llc help protect my personal assets unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships llcs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities a sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations leaving their home car and personal savings at risk in contrast forming an llc creates a business structure separate from its owners in a properly formed and managed llc only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts back to top how are llc profits taxed like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc enjoys passthrough taxation this means that owners also known as members report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns the internal revenue service irs does not assess taxes on the company itself this avoids the double taxation that general or c corporations experience in a c corporation the irs taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level when creating an llc owners need not distribute profits and losses in the llc in proportion to ownership pursuant to irs guidelines the owners of an llc can agree to allocate the companys profits and losses among themselves however they see fit not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls back to top how does an llc compare to a c corporation for many small business owners a limited liability company llc offers advantages over a c corporation also known as a general corporation creating an llc combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation the irs taxes the profits of a c corporation at corporate tax rates then if the c corporation pays dividends to shareholders the irs taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders the llc business structure avoids this double taxation the internal revenue service irs does not consider an llc itself a taxable entity instead the companys earnings pass through to the owners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns small business owners who want the flexible structure of an llc but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their llc to elect corporate taxation owners file form  tax classification election with the irs electing this status may also make an llc eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations for specific guidance small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election back to top how does an llc compare to an s corporation the limited liability company llc and the subchapter s corporation s corp share the benefit of passthrough taxation this means that owners in the company report their share of profits and losses on each owners individual tax return the internal revenue service irs assesses no separate tax on the company itself in contrast double taxation occurs when the irs taxes both a c corporations profit and dividends paid to shareholders despite the similarity of passthrough taxation an llc formation can offer advantages over an s corporation not required to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes though we recommend it llc owners need not worry about the formalities of issuing stock since an llc does not have stock no limit to the number of owners llc owners need not be us citizens or permanent residents back to top what is a series llc a series llc consists of a limited liability company with more than one series of members managers or llc interests in some cases a series llc can have a separate business purpose or investment objective for years delaware law has permitted an llc to register separate series use of this structure remains uncommon due to uncertainty over federal income tax consequences advantages include the series llc permits separate liabilityinsulated divisions within a single entity a series llc could be used as a holding company owning intangible assets or tangible assets such as real estate or as an operating company conducting different lines of business the series llc reduces costs associated with forming and maintaining
