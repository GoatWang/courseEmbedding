decision stats skip to content decision stats better decisions  faster stats menu updated interview elissa fink vp tableau software here is an interview with elissa fink vp marketing of that new wonderful software called tableau that makes data visualization so nice and easy to learn and work with ajay  describe your career journey from high school to over  plus years in marketing what are the various trends that you have seen come and go in marketing elissa i studied literature and linguistics in college and didn’t discover analytics until my first job selling advertising for the wall street journal oddly enough the study of linguistics is not that far from decision analytics they both are about taking a structured view of information and trying to see and understand common patterns at the journal i was completely captivated analyzing and comparing readership data at the same time the idea of using computers in marketing was becoming more common i knew that the intersection of technology and marketing was going to radically change things – how we understand consumers how we market and sell products and how we engage with customers so from that point on i’ve always been focused on technology and marketing whether it’s working as a marketer at technology companies or applying technology to marketing problems for other types of companies  there have been so many interesting trends taking a long view a key trend i’ve noticed is how marketers work to understand influence and motivate consumer behavior we’ve moved marketing from where it was primarily unpredictable qualitative and aimed at talking to mass audiences where the advertising agency was king now it’s a discipline that is more datadriven quantitative and aimed at conversations with individuals where the best analytics wins as with any trend the pendulum swings far too much to either side causing backlashes but overall i think we are in a great place now we are using datadriven analytics to understand consumer behavior but pure analytics is not the beall endall good marketing has to rely on understanding human emotions intuition and gut feel – consumers are far from rational so taking only a rational or analytical view of them will never explain everything we need to know ajay do you think technology companies are still predominantly dominated by men  how have you seen diversity evolve over the years what initiatives has tableau taken for both hiring and retaining great talent elissa the thing i love about the technology industry is that its key success metrics – inventing new products that rapidly gain mass adoption in pursuit of making profit – are fairly objective there’s little subjective nature to the counting of dollars collected selling a product and dollars spent building a product so if a female can deliver a better product and bigger profits faster and better then that female is going to get the resources jobs power and authority to do exactly that that’s not to say that the technology industry is genderblind raceblind etc it isn’t – technology is far from perfect for example the industry doesn’t have enough diversity in positions of power but i think overall in comparison to a lot of other industries it’s pretty darn good at giving people with great ideas the opportunities to realize their visions regardless of their backgrounds or characteristics at tableau we are very serious about bringing in and developing talented people – they are the key to our growth and success hiring is our  initiative so we’ve spent a lot of time and energy both on finding great candidates and on making tableau a place that they want to work this includes things like special recruiting events employee referral programs a flexible work environment fun social events and the rewards of working for a startup probably our biggest advantage is the company itself – working with people you respect on amazing cuttingedge products that delight customers and are changing the world is all too rare in the industry but a reality at tableau one of our senior software developers put it best when he wrote “the emphasis is on working smarter rather than longer family and friends are why we work not the other way around tableau is all about happy energized employees executing at the highest level and delivering a highly usable high quality useful product to our customers” people who want to be at a place like that should check out our openings at httpwwwtableausoftwarecomjobs ajay what are most notable features in tableau’s latest edition what are the principal software that competes with tableau software products and how would you say tableau compares with them elissa tableau  will be out in july and we are really excited about it for  reasons first we’re introducing our mobile business intelligence capabilities our customers can have tableau anywhere they need it when someone creates an interactive dashboard or analytical application with tableau and it’s viewed on a mobile device an ipad in particular the viewer will have a native touchoptimized experience no trying to get your fingertips to act like a mouse and the author didn’t have to create anything special for the ipad she just creates her analytics the usual way in tableau tableau knows the dashboard is being viewed on an ipad and presents an optimized experience second we’ve take our inmemory analytics engine up yet another level speed and performance are faster and now people can update data incrementally rapidly introduced in  our data engine makes any data fast in just a few clicks we don’t run out of memory like other applications so if i build an incredible dashboard on my gig ram pc and you try to use it on your gig ram laptop no problem and third we’re introducing more features for the international markets – including french and german versions of tableau desktop along with more international mapping options  it’s because we are constantly innovating particularly around user experience that we can compete so well in the market despite our relatively small size gartner’s seminal research study about the business intelligence market reported a massive market shift earlier this year for the first time the easeofuse of a business intelligence platform was more important than depth of functionality in other words functionality that lots of people can actually use is more important than having sophisticated functionality that only specialists can use since we focus so heavily on making easytouse products that help people rapidly see and understand their data this is good news for our customers and for us ajay  cloud computing is the next big thing with everyone having a cloud version of their software so how would you run cloud versions of tableau server say deploying it on an amazon ec  or a private cloud elissa in addition to the usual benefits espoused about cloud computing the thing i love best is that it makes data and information more easily accessible to more people easy accessibility and scalability are completely aligned with tableau’s mission our free product tableau public and our product for commercial websites tableau digital are two cloudbased products that deliver data and interactive analytics anywhere people often talk about large business intelligence deployments as having thousands of users with tableau public and tableau digital we literally have millions of users we’re serving up tens of thousands of visualizations simultaneously – talk about accessibility and scalability  we have lots of customers connecting to databases in the cloud and running tableau server in the cloud it’s actually not complex to set up in fact we focus a lot of resources on making installation and deployment easy and fast whether it’s in the cloud on premise or what have you we don’t want people to have spend weeks or months on massive rollout projects we want it to be minutes hours maybe a day or  with the cloud we see that people can get started and get results faster and easier than ever before and that’s what we’re about ajay describe some of the latest awards that tableau has been wining also how is tableau helping universities help address the shortage of business intelligence and big data professionals elissatableau has been very fortunate lately we’ve been acknowledged by both gartner and idc as the fastest growing business intelligence software vendor in the world in addition our customers and tableau have won multiple distinctions including infoworld technology leadership awards inc  deloitte fast  sql server magazine editors’ choice and community choice awards data hero awards codies american business awards among others one area we’re very passionate about is academia participating with professors students and universities to help build a new generation of professionals who understand how to use data data analysis should not be exclusively for specialists everyone should be able to see and understand data whatever their background we come from academic roots having been spun out of a stanford research project consequently we strongly believe in supporting universities worldwide and offer  academic programs the first is tableau for teaching where any professor can request free termlength licenses of tableau for academic instruction during his or her courses and we offer a lowcost student edition of tableau so that students can choose to use tableau in any of their courses at any time elissa fink vp marketingtableau
