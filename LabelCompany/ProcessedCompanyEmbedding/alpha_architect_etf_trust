you sell your mutual fund or etf at a gain you will have to pay taxes on that gain but capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares due to trading activity within your fund active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions because most etfs track an index they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions only  of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in activelymanaged funds fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees percent of comparable mutual funds that ishares core etfs outperformed morningstar as of  posttax

business wire may    am edt alpha architect today announced that it has launched its fifth proprietary index fund the alpha architect value momentum trend etf ticker vmot with a zero management fee  vmot is a fund of funds etf that seeks to track the alpha architect value momentum trend index index which seeks to capture  focused value and momentum factor premiums and  follows a proprietary trendfollowing algorithm that seeks to avoid downtrending markets against extreme losses the index seeks to mitigate extreme market drawdowns while capturing focused value and momentum exposures dr wes gray founder of alpha architect is excited for the funds prospects we see a great opportunity to provide investors with a unique type of alternative exposure vmot provides exposures to what we believe to be the most robust factor premiums value momentum and trend vmot will hold the four flagship funds of alpha architect  qval qmom imom and ival and also deploy a trend following system overlay all for zero management fees beyond the underlying etf expense ratios with zero sales representatives and a disdain for flash culture alpha architect has raised m in etf assets in under three years their overall asset base has grown from m in  to over half a billion managed accounts and etfs to date dr wesley gray and dr jack vogel cocios of alpha architect started developing their value momentum trend index soon after they completed development of their quantitative value algorithm and quantitative momentum algorithms vmot joins a small number of boutique etfs that offer trendfollowing exposure inside of an etf structure when trendfollowing signals break the fund will short domestic and international market exposures and move to a protection seeking stance dr gray continued we seek to deliver a highconviction valuemomentum approach backed by extensive academic and market research and a substantive knowledge of the manner in which irrational investor behavior creates mispricing with vmot we can now give our investors access to this strategy while simultaneously providing a mechanism that seeks to avoid downtrending markets for disciplined investors looking to access multiple factor premiums in one package vmot may be a compelling product vmot may be best suited for investors and advisors that want focused factor exposures paired with trendfollowing

last updated on april   the etf industry has been around for over  years at this point but over the past  years the etf industry has captivated the investment world i’ve had a front seat on the action launching over  exchange traded products while i was an associate at the nyse in the global indexing and exchange traded product group we built indexes for etfs participated on weekly calls with the sec trying to get approval for innovative etfs that fell outside the standard rules and guided new etf issuers through the whole process  it was here that i learned one important fact of a new etf you the financial advisor will never see a bad backtest for an etf if the investment idea had a poor backtest it didn’t make it to market i transitioned to revenueshares to be their head of capital markets which we grew from  million to  billion and was eventually sold to the mutual fund giant oppenheimer funds during my seven years in the industry i’ve witnessed that some industry players were prepared some were caught flat footed and some are still trying to figure out what to do next in this piece wes asked me to share some insights on the etf industry and where it might be heading based on some trends i’ve witnessed i’ll start this essay with a recap of recent merger and acquisition activity in the etf space then discuss why advisors are back in the driving seat mention briefly some trends in etf product development and end with some discussions of what we could expect going forward modified slightly from the original photo source etfs create disruption do you buy your way into the business in  and  there was a wave of etf company acquisitions by large asset management firms the reason was simple if an asset management company was not in the etf game they realized they really needed to get in it etfs were not a fad that was going away asset management firms had two options build the etf division of their firm from within acquire an etf company and its existing team andor etf products some asset managers chose option  indexiq was acquired by new york life janus bought velocityshares oppenheimer funds bought revenueshares full disclosure my former employers hartford funds acquired acquired lattice strategies columbia threadneedle bought emerging global advisors victory capital acquired compass emp if you’re a big asset management firm acquiring a small etf firm you want to lever your strengths your brand large distribution force and large amount of capital you need to acquire an etf company that enables you to do that the sweet spot for an acquisition is an etf company that is small enough in assets under management aum that it isn’t an impossibly steep price yet large enough in assets that your firm has a head start on distribution and marketing combine that sweet spot of assets with a decent length of time for their etfs track record and you have a company that is an ideal acquisition target if you examined the list of etf companies in the us at the start of  there was a decent number of acquirable firms in that aum and track record sweet spot  million —  billion in aum and three to eight years of track record at the start of  the etf landscape looks very different for potential etf company acquirers looking at the etf league table from etfcom let’s categorize all the etf product linescompanies that have over  billion in aum i’ll use some very official divisions to categorize why they’re either totally not acquirable or near impossible aum numbers below as of april   the “you can’t buy us but maybe we’ll buy you” division blackrock —   trillion vanguard —  billion state street —   billion invesco powershares  —    billion charles schwab —  billion guggenheim —   billion the privately ownedunicorn division first trust —  billion vaneck —  billion proshares —  billion direxion —  billion us commodity funds technically publicly traded but a unicorn —  billion the “already acquired by or started by a larger wealth management firm” division alps —  billion deutsche bank —  billion northern trust —  billion pimco —  billion ubs —  billion barclays capital —  billion credit suisse —  billion etf securities has one of the largest european etf businesses —  billion indexiq acquired by ny life —  billion oppenheimerfunds acquired revenueshares —  billion victory capital management acquired compass emp —  billion this division is interesting because you could try to convince some of these firms that a spin off of their etf business would enable it to achieve its full value we’re assuming that’s too complicated and these firms want to hold on the “we started later but are choosing to go it alone” division fidelity —  billion jpmorgan —  billion goldman sachs —  billion the “i’m kinda seeing someone already” division global x partially owned by jpmorgan —  billion the exemptive relief division exchange traded concepts —  billion etf managers group —  billion advisorshares —  billion millington securities —  billion the wisdomtree division wisdomtree —  billion can they be bought yes will they be bought they’re often thrown around as a target acquisition for one of the behemoth asset management firms but likely too large and too expensive now ok that is every etf companyproduct line that has over  billion in assets none of them are really acquirable yes there’s always a price but any firm that can buy the firms above it probably doesn’t make sense to and any firm that would like to acquire the firms above can’t under  billion in aum we have some very large asset management firms that are either going it alone in building their etf business line or they bought a small etf shop mainly as an acquihire saying this because there was either a short track record for the etf shop acquired small aum or both since the rush of  acquisitions the options to acquire firms have become much slimmer if you’re a firm that is looking to buy your way into the etf space then what are the best options from what’s left here’s the list of firms under  billion  but over   million in aum in millions source etfcom this is a good range to focus on as these firms are large enough to be of interest to a larger firm or soon could be within those there’s three independent etf shops to keep an eye on pacer financial o’shares fqf trust cambria beyond falling in that aum range each of them has a product suite that achieves the following can handle a large capacity of assets due to how they’re structured their products can be sold in major portfolio allocation segments they each have a product suite that has a theme to them that could be expanded upon by a larger firm for future product development those are the key things to look for if you’re considering acquiring your way into the etf business sure they each have some flaws in an acquisition scenario pacer’s trendpilot products are more complicated to sell to the average client o’shares has a short track record and cambria just raised additional capital but if they were perfect they’d already be acquired the initial plan–etfs will deliver cheap beta in part one we looked at the state of the etf industry from a businessacquisition perspective how did we get here though and where are we headed next the etf industry started in  with the launch of spy  this started the first wave for the industry market capitalization weighting or “cheap” beta to most investors and asset managers for the next eighteen years until about  market cap weighting equaled etfs etfs were market cap weighed they were one in the same if an advisor wanted the chance at outperformance they invested with mutual funds if they wanted cheap beta they bought an etf the financial advisor was now becoming the active manager once again helping clients decide among various active and passive offerings let me explain for many of the more seasoned financial advisors in the business ie those who have been around for at least  years when these advisors started their careers they woke up every morning diving through individual company information to find the best stocks they could purchase for their clients and that was fun that was the part of the business that got them excited if they made the right call for their clients on a stock it could make their career throughout their careers though it slowly became less of stock and bond picking and more of assigning that active management role to the mutual fund industry the advisor found a few mutual fund companies he or she trusted he picked their funds across asset classes for diversification put his clients’ money in them and checked in on the funds occasionally to make sure they were performing to expectations the creation of market cap weighted etfs began to change the financial advisors’ role back to their earlier days of the business once again they had to make the call should i buy the van eck egypt etf egpt or maybe invest in india using the ishares india etf inda gold could protect my clients downside if we have another  maybe i should buy some of state street’s spdr gold shares etf gld yeah but gld owns us gold and the us confiscated people’s gold in  i better buy etfs physical swiss gold shares etf sgol just to be safe… decisions decisions decisions etfs empowered advisors and individual investors with decisions and took that power away from the mutual fund companies all of this happened on the back of a relatively small number of marketcap weighted etfs for example in  there were a “record”  exchange traded products listed on the new york stock exchange many people thought that everything that could be done with etfs had been done around that time we crossed  etfs listed in the us the only thing left to do was launch the “zimbabwe market cap weighted etf” or some other obscure location or sector that wasn’t already taken by ishares or state street but the etf industry was only starting to revolutionize the asset management industry the industry moved from delivering cheap beta to delivering socalled “smart” beta the active mutual fund managers were already in trouble when advisors had more decision points and an ability to allocate to cheap marketcap weighted etfs but the introduction of products that would directly compete with mutual fund manager’s active products was extremely disruptive the new plan–etfs will deliver “smart” beta from a product development standpoint there wasn’t much left to be done in the marketcap weighted space  to twist a yogi berra quote “no one builds market cap weighted etfs anymore they’re too crowded” plus with expense ratios approaching zero launching a marketcap weighted product only served as a loss leader or as a way to stay relevant in the minds of investors and advisors in many respects marketcap weighted etfs serve as a utility for the asset management industry nothing fancy but they deliver your electricity at lowcost remarkably these investment “utilities” were difficult to beat the combination of rules based investing removing behavioral biases lower management fees and the tax efficiency of the etf wrapper made it all but impossible for actively managed mutual funds to outperform market cap weighted etfs over time the etf industry was not satisfied with the status quo as jeff bezos is quoted as saying “your profit margin is my opportunity” etf firms started seeing the juicy active mutual fund profit margin as an opportunity and decided it was time to compete — and win why couldn’t an etf firm take the benefits of the etf structure — rulesbased taxefficient and transparent — and turn that into a weapon against the active mutual fund managers rob arnott of research affiliates rafi figured he’d give it a chance with the advent of “smart beta” powershares launched the powershares ftse rafi us  portfolio prf on  no one knew it at the time but this was the biggest launch of the etf industry since the launch of spy in  in contrast to spy and most of the etfs that came before it this fund removed price from the passive weighting equation of its constituents they instead chose to weight their etf holdings by a variety of “value factors” in an attempt to provide outperformance six months later wisdomtree a former personal finance magazine company  launched their first etfs in june  wisdomtree also chose not to use price in the weighting of their etfs they chose to weight their funds using a dividend methodology one year after wisdomtree’s launch in may  first trust launched their first alphadex etfs the first trust alphadex etfs like powershares rafi indexes chose to use multiple factors to weight their etfs holdings and therefore exclude price from the equation at the time these firms were small players in the etf industry fast forward to march  though and these firms represent numbers four six and seven in etf assets under management the era of market cap weighting product development ran from  until  when we saw the final player rush in smart beta started in  and had the two other dominant firms established two years later it wasn’t until  though that the term smart beta really began to take hold by  mostly everyone knew etfs were real most knew you couldn’t launch marketcap weighted products because that battle was fought and there was no money left to be made there but firms thought they could compete on products that provided differentiated weighting schemes jpmorgan launched their first etf in  a multifactor etf about a year after that goldman sachs entered the etf world with a suite of multifactor etfs of their own and fidelity launched their own suite of smart beta funds in  though still relatively new players overall as these firms were sooner to catch the second trend within etfs they’ve more rapidly gained assets in the space and now make up a reasonable percentage of the assets in this category since the launch of prf in  ishares state street and many other firms entered the smart beta etf weighting area as well etf product development started out as a race to fill the entire globe with straightforward strategies that would offer investors exposure to anything there was demand for or not it moved on to attempting to offer exposure to those areas in a more intelligent smart way that race is continuing and there is still room for innovation there but the price war has started here as well the next plan–etf will deliver esg with the first two etf waves — cheap beta and smart beta — when the rush of product development came there was already a large amount of assets invested in those areas and those areas were continuing to grow rapidly from a product development standpoint there seems to be a third way emerging esg investing there’s been a rush of asset managers launching etfs in the esg space but assets are minimal a few billion dollars legg mason has filed for two new esg etfs nuveen launched a suite of esg etfs oppenheimer funds launched two ishares has the longest running ones kld and dsi state street successfully launched the spdr ssga gender diversity index etf she the rush makes sense for a few reasons if you’re a larger asset manager you know from the first two trends that it can pay to be early with market cap weighted etfs being nearly free and smart beta etfs beginning to experience the same pricing pressure thanks a lot goldman there could be money to be made here as the etf issuers are setting higher expense ratios on these products if esg etfs prove to be the third trend it could give firms that missed the first two waves a shot at taking major core allocation placement in investors portfolios all good reasons from a business standpoint to take the shot if you have the capital to be patient on waiting to see if the trend takes off that business reasoning is why we have the supply of etfs ready to catch this trend let’s analyze the demand for esg etfs and figure out why that isn’t there yet low asset under management in the products and if it makes sense that the demand will catch up to the supply what’s the real idea behind esg investing the idea is investors want to make a difference with their investments they want to invest in companies that at least aren’t damaging the world or at best are making the world a better place in a number of different ways esg stands for environmental social and governance after all in doing so the hope is to coerce companies into making better decisions can investing in certain companies based off certain metrics cause change to be made by individual companies yes inclusion in an index likely can change a company’s behavior if there’s enough assets pushing them one way or another if we had an etf that had a trillion dollars of aum in it and it only invested in the  largest companies that powered themselves with solar roofs we’d see a lot more companies moving to power themselves with solar roofs from a financial advisor standpoint i know there’s demand from clients as well i had one financial advisor recently tell me after she added the phrase “socially responsible investing strategies” to her website she received two unsolicited calls from individual investors telling them they called her instead of her competitors when looking for a financial advisor because she had that phrase listed on her website if you’re a financial advisor i’d recommend you put that phrase on your website–you might get lucky ok we’re pretty sure we can change companies’ behavior based off of rules for investing in them or not investing in them and we’re pretty sure there’s at least some clients out there asking for it but there’s still no real assets in the space yet on the etf side so why are etf companies rushing to get into the space the leading reason thrown around for that future demand and aum to come millennials the holders of the future assets etf firms are predicting that based off studies like the one above full data here millennials will be providing a rush of assets into socially responsible funds as they become the wealthiest generation with the baby boomer generation aging the phrasing of these types of questions is highly misleading though ask young people from any generation that question and i bet you’d see similar answers let’s flip the question do you want to invest in a socially irresponsible manner you’d likely get  saying no from every generation millennials want their money invested soundly companies are changing to make themselves more socially responsible more environmentally friendly and have better social governance as the pressure of society forces them to do so in  under  of companies within the sp  reported a sustainability report by   of companies did the corporate change esg investing is meant to drive is occurring already etfs are not a missing tool needed to force that change they are the needed tool in forcing the other changes we are seeing across the financial world lower cost and more transparency esg investing makes sense from a business standpoint but it won’t be moving beyond a niche in the etf world the next big idea helping investors and advisors pick etfs financial advisors started off in the drivers seat picking stocks driving asset allocation and really being engaged in the asset management piece of their client portfolios then mutual funds came around and advisors took a backseat as they simply allocated assets to a few mutual fund families and called it a day but the demise of mutual funds and the rise of etfs have shifted portfolio decisions back to financial advisors advisors are now faced with the question of which etfs to buy and how to set asset allocation they need help and tools to accomplish their new mission the next wave of etf services will revolve around helping financial advisors make sense of it all a good example is the visual active share tool just released by alpha architect with almost  etfs and  mutual funds out there the etf firms that excel in the future are going to be the ones that can provide advisors and investors with the knowledge and tools to confidently construct etf portfolios and make good use of those  products as with the other trends some firms were early to this trend many of the leading etf issuers provide tools on their websites for clients to build their own models some are providing prebuilt etf models for free on their websites and their sales forces are working with financial advisors in a truly consultative way to construct customized etf models financial advisors are drowning in emails and phone calls from etf wholesalers looking to pitch them on their products the last thing a financial advisor needs is one more sales person walking in to tell them they have the best product for them some of them are even right they do have the best product but how does the product fit into their portfolio financial advisors need holistic advice below are some example questions an etf wholesaler should explore with future advisors what is the overlap of the etf we’re discussing and the rest of my portfolio does it increase my diversification in an intelligent way or is it more ownership in assets i already own what does it do for the cost of my portfolio cost isn’t everything but i better be getting something additional for that cost etf exposures are getting cheaper and cheaper what does this do for the valuation of my portfolio what matters is the historical average valuation of a product products can become overcrowded the spdr utilities select sector spdr xlu is always we hope going to trade at a lower valuation than the purefunds ise cyber security etf hack but if xlu is trading at a  pe its probably not the right time to add to it… what’s the best way to achieve my desired exposure as an example if i’m a value and growth investor what’s the best way to get my exposure to value and growth what are the tax concerns if any with this type of product what is the current liquidity profile of this product and can that change or can i get my money out as easily as i can get it in some products can move in and out of more liquid and less liquid assets as they rebalance this can rapidly change the liquidity profile of the etf in a liquidity crisis almost everything becomes illiquid wes has a good piece on this subject how etfs trade in the secondary market if you can help an advisor address the questions above your etf firm stands a good chance to pick up assets if you cannot you’ve got a  in  shot — ugly constructing lower cost transparent tax efficient etf portfolios is a trend that hasn’t peaked but now more than ever investor education is critical to success

passive investing last updated on may   nobody can predict the future but there is a chance the blind purchase of broadindex portfolios will come to an abrupt and potentially chaotic end when the music finally stops this argument is the thesis of this blog post this article looks at decisionmaking trends in the context of security selection and asset allocation that may have significant implications for investors in particular there has been tremendous growth in broad marketcap weighted index investing eg sp  and automated rebalancing strategies ish portfolios these products are often purchased with little to no due diligence blindly purchasing an investment product is rarely a sensible idea for example one should consider the price paid eg valuation and the value received eg asset quality the separation of critical thought and an investment decision often serves as a necessary behavioral condition perhaps not sufficient that can lead to socalled bubbles eg the dot com bubble or the  global financial crisis let’s dig into the global financial crisis a bit further in the build up to the crisis investors demanded investmentgrade stamps but skipped due diligence the word of the ratings agency was good enough — whoops trust but verify there are potential parallels with the current “passive” index investing frenzy ie beta  megacap factor funds as due diligence is often no longer a consideration and investors are placing their trust in efficient markets in recent years this has worked well for those employing the strategy broad passive indexes have crushed almost everything limited due diligence incredible shortterm performance and a perceived “free” investment product what could go wrong to be fair index products such as exchangetraded funds etfs can be great tools and help many investors just like collateralized debt obligations or cdos however there is a significant liquidity mismatch between the trading volume of some index products and that of their underlying securities when index buyers and sellers are close to equilibrium there may be no problem however if an imbalance develops and liquidity spills over into the underlying markets then we may could see significant volatility if the tail starts wagging the dog etf supplydemand drives underlying stock prices not fundamentals wes has a good summary of the research on this topic here figure  index products dwarf underlying stock liquidity source aaron brask capital this article focuses on the risks posed by a growing number of priceinsensitive investors it is divided into three primary sections followed by a conclusion in the first section i discuss problems i identify with broad market indexing and automated rebalancing strategies next i draw parallels between investor priceinsensitivity and credit crisis in the next section lastly i present some numbers to put the risks into perspective investing based on faith can cause problems there are two primary decisionmakers in the typical investment process the advisor who selects and maintains an asset allocation the fund managers who select individual securities in my mind thoughtful due diligence should take place at both levels however there are strong trends driving many investors in precisely the opposite directions figure  investment process decisionmakers source aaron brask capital broad market passive index investing to be clear i am an advocate of sensible lowcost index investing it is easy to do much worse than follow the broad market indices investors can get snagged in highfee and opaque products which are often the result of limited due diligence the very issue we are discussing however i believe this specific type of index investing is approaching levels whereby its impact on share prices has moved from being “immaterial” to material as i discussed in my article index investing low fees but high costs and briefly describe below broad market index strategies do not employ any risk management approaches other than diversification even this is selfdefeating to some degree due to the mechanical concentration in the largest companies via marketcap weighting at the end of the day passive index investors invest in all companies good and bad at whatever their prevailing valuations happen to be cheap fair or expensive the theory supporting broad market index strategies assumes the rest of the market participants are actively keeping prices more or less in line so index investors can get a free ride on their due diligence there are merits to this argument but there is also irony in my view the success and growth of these indexing strategies creates two significant issues the first issue relates to the basic premise of relying on the rest of the market to keep prices in line as the balance of index investors increases there may be fewer investors left to conduct due diligence while we are far from this scenario even vanguard founder jack bogle admits “if everybody indexed the only word you could use is chaos” i believe the second issue is more critical in particular the process of blindly allocating capital without regard for quality or valuation can reinforce and magnify mispricing for example consider a company that has become overpriced in other words its market capitalization is larger than it should be this gives the company a higher weighting in the index as each new investment dollar pours into the index more will go to purchasing the overpriced company than if it were fairly valued this marginal extra buying pressure could then push the price higher this process represents a vicious cycle whereby index investing can effectively reinforce and exacerbate overpricing it is worth noting this phenomenon occurs regardless of whether we can or cannot identify which companies are over or underpriced given the tremendous growth of the index investing industry this is a legitimate concern vanguard’s assets under management reached  trillion this january more concerning is that  of that figure was due to growth experienced in just the last three years while it is one thing to invest blindly i believe it is important to understand the mechanics of index investing and how they can impact the market especially if these investors are not buy and hold forever investors asset allocation similar logic and reasoning apply to the hottest topic in asset allocation automated rebalancing systems roboadvisors turn off the due diligence process and allow markets to take the steering wheel of their ruledbased investment vehicles to be fair many advisors embrace fixed asset allocation approaches so this is not necessarily an issue with the new technologies for rebalancing but is still emblematic of the more general trend of blindly following rules without considering the potential implications at the heart of each of these strategies is the notion of diversification defined with varying levels of sophistication to quote warren buffett “diversification is protection against ignorance” as i have discussed in previous articles diversification is not the only tool investors should use to understand and manage risk my point is simply that investors relying on diversification should still conduct a sanitycheck on their investments for quality and valuation the skinny given the extraordinary efforts of central banks in recent years the prices and valuations of most assets have been elevated we no longer have the luxury of investing in safe bonds with healthy yields on the order of  like we did before the tech and housing bubbles in my view many investors have been scared away from bonds where low expected returns are obvious however many investors have jumped from the frying pan into the fryer valuations in the stock market now exceed those we saw before the credit crisis and rival those seen during the tech bubble as a result i believe diversification between stocks and bonds offers the least benefit now relative to any point in the last  years if markets were not already in such a precarious state it might be easier to overlook these trends however i believe the timing could not be worse i have already expressed my views on how markets will reconcile with fundamentals in previous articles so i will take a step back here and describe how i view the bigger picture when it comes to investing the typical advisorled strategy involves multiple layers of decisionmaking that impact the returns investors ultimately achieve at the business level each company’s management makes decisions that alter its fundamental performance and determine how profits are allocated to investors ie dividends versus buybacks the market processes this data in aggregate ie market participants buy and sell as they see fit and fund managers select stocks based on varying combination of fundamentals management quality valuation and other factors lastly advisors select various funds for their client portfolios and rebalance those holdings according to their mandate eg maintain a  stockbond allocation given the cozy relationships that exist between many boards of directors and corporate executives it can be difficult to impose changes at the business level thus the stewardship of fund and portfolio managers who select individual securities becomes more important in addition to identifying good businesses they should also ensure management teams pass on sufficient value to their shareholders climbing higher up the food chain advisors should define the appropriate allocation ranges for their clients and allocate capital to quality portfolio managers in my view these allocations should reflect the risk profile of the client and also embed forecasts for performance based on the quality and valuations of the assets unfortunately this latter role of due diligence is often missing these two roles advisor and fundportfolio manager naturally have implications for the performance of client portfolios if either of these stewards were not present then the door would open for unnecessary risks to creep into the portfolio it is fine and well to use technology to displace the advice and expertise of such professionals which is often conflicted and less competent than one might hope however endeavoring to go on autopilot can be extremely especially dangerous when the flight instructions embed flaws than can actually exacerbate market volatility i am not trying to guide one on the pros and cons of blind allocation strategies or their variants my point is to help readers become aware of these strategies many other investors are pursuing in particular i believe it is important to understand how these mechanics and market dynamics may help explain some markets’ seemingly anomalous performance more importantly i hope this will prompt some to conduct sanity checks on how their portfolio is being managed and help them prepare for what markets may be likely to do going forward parallels to the credit crisis there are some behavioral parallels between the current lack of due diligence in the index investing space and in the period leading up to the credit crisis while many market commentators blame the housing bubble on banking deregulation and greed i have a different view going back as far as the s the securities exchange commission sec allowed if not encouraged the investment community to rely on the ratings provided by the major credit ratings agencies eventually the sec officially endorsed major credit ratings agencies as being nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations nrsros this move had significant implications there was a now a governmentendorsed oligopoly on the credit ratings that allowed or disallowed investment from many of the largest pools of money in existence indeed the capacity of many entities including banks insurers and pensions to invest in credit products hinged on whether or not they were deemed investment grade or not the nrsros were the exclusive gatekeepers that provided this stamp of approval as time passed dependency on nrsro ratings increased both by both regulated and unregulated investors the investment world was weaned off of credit due diligence and just looked for the ratings agencies’ stamps in theory the economy of scale of the ratings agencies could provide benefits to the investment community in practice conflicts of interest evolved making this an unlikely outcome in particular the ratings agencies were paid by issuers to rate their credit products it was a perfect recipe for a crisis to brew many investors were compelled to purchase investment grade credit products then they relied on conflicted parties to rate them indeed these agencies had a natural incentive to provide better ratings to attract business attract repeat business this setup was a huge boon to banks mortgage agencies ratings agencies and other parties involved in manufacturing derivative credit products ie cdos and the like moreover one could argue political motives regarding universal home ownership helped feed this machine the ingredients it needed to create its products figure  recipe for a crash source aaron brask capital in short i believe the root cause or enabler of the credit crisis was the endorsement of the conflicted credit ratings agencies given the considerable complexity of these products eg the  tranches of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages or other derivative assets what fiduciary in their right mind would have invested money without conducting due diligence when investors stopped conducting their own due diligence and started relying on the rating agencies it opened the door for conflicts of interest and capital misallocation – ultimately culminating in the credit crisis while it is easy to blame the banks i liken the situation to placing a steak on the edge of your lawn can you really get mad at your neighbor’s dog for eating it the ingredients were put in place the recipe was public knowledge fannie mae and freddie mac had been doing this for years and the table was set with investors waiting to eat is it really such a surprise wall street could not resist the allure of profits from manufacturing these products as the credit crisis unfolded there were severe liquidity mismatches in the case of credit products the derivatives tail wagged the dog as many of these products were imploding they ultimately had to be unwound in the underlying credit market unfortunately the derivatives market was magnitudes larger and this bottleneck creates huge price distortions i see investors once again ceasing due diligence this time it relates to their overall investment strategies and there are no ratings agencies they are simply placing their trust in market efficiency if history is any indication this will likely end in tears as i explain in the liquidity section there is again a liquidity mismatch that may become apparent if there is significant selling of index products there are also several anecdotal signs of an emerging bubble etfs of etfs there are now hordes of etfs that invest in other etfs this reminds me of two trends before in the period before the credit crisis the first was the fundoffunds craze where fund companies were setup to purchase other hedge funds as if hedge fund fees were not high enough second was the cdosquared product where remnants of old cdos were tossed together to create new cdos of cdos proliferation of indexes according to bloomberg there are now more indices than stocks in the us leverage with investors going to great lengths to buy yield in the markets leverage has become a popular tool i have observed some similar themes surfacing in equity products for example there are multiple products that take leveraged views on the stock market via shorting the vix volatility and market direction are negatively correlated so taking short positions in the vix results in leveraged exposure to the underlying market in this case the sp  index moreover now quadrupleleveraged etfs are being considered by the market seriously looking at some numbers tail wagging the dog in this section i observe the market from three different angles first i observe valuations and compare them to those before the tech and housing bubbles second i look at the relative magnitudes of liquidity in sp  index products versus its underlying constituents lastly i highlight two more buckets of investors who tend to exacerbate market moves with their procyclical buying and selling patterns valuations one place market folly can show up is in valuations while many do not see the forest for the trees high valuations have historically resulted in dismal returns in subsequent years probably not telling you anything you don’t already know indeed high valuations were evident leading up to both the tech bubble and credit crisis collapses we know how those stories ended unfortunately valuations are now higher than before the credit crisis and rivaling those seen during the tech bubble based on forecasts by gmo large us equity is the most overvalued of all asset classes they expect a  real return over the next seven years this translates into a  loss of purchasing power it is worth noting this forecast is worse than their estimate for us large caps and every other asset class before the credit crisis moreover their current forecasts are lower now for every asset class except international small cap and emerging market equities that is why the current market is sometimes referred to as the ‘everything bubble’ if you are interested in reading more about the relationship between valuation and market performance please read my articles more market correction to come the noncredit crisis and tea leaves one can die on the vine waiting for a valuationbased market correction but this is certainly something to consider as a longterm investor liquidity mismatch one worrisome observation about the current market is the liquidity mismatch between index products and their underlying constituents futures etfs and other index products have become immensely popular trading vehicles in fact they have become so popular that some of their dollar trading volumes outweigh those of their underlying constituents figure  index products dwarf underlying stock liquidity source aaron brask capital figure  above illustrates this case for sp  index products in particular the average daily trading volume for the sp  emini futures is approximately  billion per day the spdr sp  etf trust ticker spy trades another bn per day however the underlying stocks of the sp  index only trade about  billion per day so the trading volume of these two index products is almost five times the volume in the underlying shares given the massive growth of index products in recent years the creation of new etf shares has resulted in net buying activity at the stock level so i suspect this has been a major driver of the recent bull market even without this driver the buyers and sellers of the index products might just trade amongst themselves in this case there may be no problem as the volume might not spill over into the underlying stocks i am concerned with the flip side of the growth situation significant problems may arise if markets take a turn south if that is the case and a significant imbalance develops at the index product level the underlying stocks may not be able to withstand the magnitude of volume that spills into their market given the autopilot nature of the strategies that got markets to this point it would not surprise me if index investors’ beliefs in efficient markets get shaken and create just such an imbalance perhaps these new index investors are ironwilled buyandholders but i doubt this is the case unless of course human nature has changed two more cyclical investors in addition to the autopilot investors whom i suspect will exacerbate or intensify future market declines there are two other groups of investors who also tend to buy and sell in a cyclical pattern the first group is margin investors these investors borrow money to purchase shares of stocks this leverage tends to be employed by more speculative investors as figure  below illustrates many of these margin investors tend to evaporate during market declines and thus contribute to the market selling figure  nyse margin debt source aaron brask capital nyse sp right now margin debt on the nyse is at a record high – more than  above its previous peak previous market declines saw margin debt fall by a bit more than  if that were the case going forward this would amount to approximately  billion in selling this translates into seven entire days of average stock volume though of course this selling would occur over a longer period figure  sp  buybacks bn source factset another group of cyclical investors are companies themselves the bulk of their share repurchases occur during bull market periods but typically come to a screeching halt during market declines figure  above illustrates this phenomenon during the credit crisis this naturally reduces the pool of buyers significantly the simultaneous increased selling by margin investors and reduced buying by companies likely contributed to the violent nature of the last two major market declines ie the tech and housing bubbles i do not expect this time to be any different conclusions i have no crystal ball and market dynamics are incredibly complex the intent of my piece is not to suggest that the world is falling or anything i’ve foreshadowed is guaranteed to happen this article is simply meant to make you think my primary goal is to highlight the lack of due diligence that is currently taking place as well as potential implications for investors the trend toward automated rebalancing strategies and broad market index investing not only enables markets and individual securities to deviate from their fundamentals but it can also reinforce or exacerbate it potentially in my view lack of due diligence was the primary driver of the credit crisis at least then investors demanded some sort of rubber stamp indicating the credit quality now they are relying solely on their belief in efficient markets as sentiment surveys have shown historically investors’ beliefs can turn on a dime lack of due diligence is not the only similarity between investors today and then indeed the same types of products are surfacing and there is widespread use of leverage in various forms eg x leveraged etfs vixbased funds etfs of etfs etc moreover there is a significant mismatch between the liquidity of many of these products and their underlying securities as i wrote in my previous article tea leaves there are signs that corporate fundamentals and the economy are slowing given the backdrop of investor optimism and elevated market

available here towards the bottom references       ↑ note actually i would argue there is a third but it is beyond the scope of this article i am referring to the corporate management teams who run the businesses and distribute profits to shareholders  ↑ technical note index investing has grown significantly in recent years for good reason but that it not to say it is not without flaws below i highlight three subtle but significant issues with index investing market capitalization weighting by construction this type of allocation overweights overpriced and underweights underpriced stocks i describe this more below and how this phenomenon can reinforce itself research studies have shown this bias can impose a drag of  on more liquid large cap indices and as much as  or more on smaller cap and emerging market indices frontrunning while transparency is generally a good thing hedge funds and other professional traders use the transparency of index rules to frontrun their trades indeed index rules are wellknown so it is often not difficult to forecast what stocks will go into and out of indexbased portfolios this activity pushes up down the prices of stocks index managers will purchase sell my research indicates this can impose a performance drag of at least  on larger more liquid indices and as much as  on indices with less liquid constituents and higher turnover freefloat adjustment skin in the game is a concept many investment managers look for when investing in stocks indeed inside ownership can surely motivate corporate executives to do what is best for a company however many of the standard indices adjust their index weights in precisely the opposite direction this was not the intention of index providers however it was a direct result of their attempt to increase the liquidity of their indices by making their relative weights dependent on the amount of shares available to the public ie not held by insiders  ↑ i am assuming market capitalization weighted index weightings  ↑ technical note not all rebalancing strategies are the same below i consider three such approaches and highlight the risks relevant to this context while the first two may be blind to underlying asset quality and valuation the third may be more dangerous in that it can systematically exacerbate volatile markets fixed asset allocation even if it is brainless to the extent it ignores the quality and valuation of the assets i believe maintaining a fixed asset allocation is the most benign of the automated rebalancing strategies as one asset increases and outgrows its percentage allocations it gets trimmed and reallocated to other assets in theory this translates into a contrarian or volatility dampening strategy since it would purchase stocks in a declining market unfortunately it typically constrains the performance of a portfolio over the long term by systematically trimming allocations to the highest growth assets eg stocks agebased asset allocation there is an old rule of thumb indicating equity allocations should be “ minus your age” this naturally ignores all concepts related to the fundamentals and valuations it does not embed the contrarian nature of fixed asset allocations but at least does not necessarily pour lighter fluid on fires however if the babyboomer demographic pursues such strategies this could translate into fewer and fewer equities in their portfolios over the next few decades risk parity it is worth noting that riskparity is a relatively newer phenomenon and some of its implementations use volatility controls these models effectively increase allocations to asset with lower volatilities in recent years markets have gone up and pushed volatility down thus allocations to equities have presumably increased however when volatility surfaces typically the result of a market decline then these models adjust by reducing allocations to the volatile assets these strategies remind of the constant proportion portfolio insurance cppi strategies which were heavily used during the s cppi strategies similarly adjusted market exposures based on trailing performance in such a way that market declines triggered more selling in my view these dynamics can be quite dangerous for example once selling began on black monday october   a vicious cycle ensued and the dow jones industrial index and sp  both fell by more than  markets and strategies have evolved since then eg market circuit breakers but i suspect the chaos that transpired on monday august  of last year is a sign similar risks still lurk beneath the surface of our markets today  ↑ william jahnke described in his  paper the asset allocation hoax how many investment managers happily rely on fixed asset allocation strategies since it “conveniently shelters both the consultant and the investment manager from the most important investment decision” the more general purpose of his paper was to expose the misinterpretation of a previous study than many advisors cited to promote fixed asset allocation strategies  ↑ there appears to be an almost insatiable thirst for bonds regardless of low and even negative yields in some cases stocks in aggregate have defied the gravity of lofty valuations for years now numerous headlines have highlighted the topheavy nature of stock returns eg aapl has contributed  of the dow jones industrial performance yeartodate  ↑ grantham mayo  van otterloo is a reputable investment firm that has an impressive history of market forecasts their current and historical market forecasts are freely available on their website wwwgmocom  ↑ inflation adjusted about the author aaron brask aaron is an accomplished mathematical finance phd who runs his own registered investment advisor ria  aaron

performance and comfort to my clients i continually strive to demonstrate my loyalty and value to my clients so they know their financial affairs are being handled with the care and expertise they deserve drsoul very interesting – and sobering – analysis thank you fyi in the second paragraph under the subhead “valuations” i believe the word “expect” should be “except” wesley gray phd drsoul i fixed the typo thx aaron brask thank you for your comment and the headsup on the typo there are various forms of leverage embedded in this market only time will tell how this impacts things going forward gman wonderful article and analysis thank you it makes perfect sense that the liquidity mismatch between those trading the sp  via index funds and the underlying stocks is likely to magnify a market downturn in a gross over simplification the scene from die hard with a vengeance where bruce willis had to get exactly  gallons of water with only a  gallon and  gallon jug comes to mind – if he wasn’t able to get the right amount of “liquidity” in time something was going to blow up aaron brask thank you gman more generally i think too many things have been securitized loans homes commercial property volatility etc and sold to retail investors this can create a feedback mechanism whereby market pain is transferred back into the economy volatility spooks retail they dump and then transactions occur in the real economy banks and loanmarkers no longer provide shock absorption fwiw – fill  gallon and pour into  gallon fill  gallon again and pour until  gallon full leaving  gallon in  gallon jug empty  gallon transfer  gallon and then add another  by filling and transferring from  gallon jug gman thanks for the reply and no surprises that you nailed the riddle too with regard to the technical note on “freefloat adjustment” – i understand this occurred in  for the sp  no problem there however i also understand that the historical returns for that index are not adjusted to reflect this change – is that correct effectively this results in the elimination of “insider ownership” from the construction of the index – an attribute associated with higher than market returns how much performance ie return may have been extricated from the sp  in consequence of this change also how does sp benefit financially by adjusting for the free float – do they charge a few basis points to fund management companies like vanguard for using their index and therefore benefit from the increased liquidity created by adjusting for the free float apologies for the questions it just seems quite material aaron brask free float correct the historical index values do not reflect that change and yes i suspect a properly recalculated history integrating ff adjustment would have lower returns sp benefit yes i assume this was a move to remove a bottleneck and enable more aum and hence more fees how much they charge various fund managers is private but i think your
