project in northeastern democratic republic of the congo drc under the joint venture agreement signed in january  randgold will manage and fund exploration of the exploration permit areas comprising loncors ngayu project until the completion of a prefeasibility study on any gold discovery meeting the investment criteria of randgold subject to the drcs free carried interest requirements randgold would earn  of any discovery with loncor holding the balance of  loncor will be required from that point forward to fund its prorata share in respect of the discovery in order to maintain its  interest or be diluted processed data and final products from the  line kilometre helicopter borne electromagnetic vtem survey completed over the ngayu belt by geotech airborne limited of aurora canada have been combined with all other geological layers to complete an updated integrated geological map of the belt and to refine and prioritize areas of interest aois the four preliminary aois have several kilometre long mineralised strike potential focused on extension of known mineralized trends as well as areas of geochemical anomalies and structural complexity the four priority aois identified are summarized below priority  kilometre long imva fold structure extensive geochemical anomalies and several gold occurrences along major structures and complex deformation around intrusions yindiaguluku trend  kilometre long northwest extension of the yindiaguluku mineralised trend with high soil and bleg geochemical anomalies in the yindi and anguluku prospect areas younger

bifs wrap around the western side of a regional intrusive complex adumbi trend  kilometre mineralised northwest extension of the adumbi trend with moderate bleg anomalism along the entire aoi in places associated with similar lithological setting as the adumbi deposit northern ngayu  kilometre structural trend located in an area of complex folding of bifs and carbonaceous shale a localized area of high bleg anomalism associated with a northwest trending fold axis the setting and geochemical anomalism indicate the potential for fold plunging style mineralization the initial work program will have a twopronged approach a geological review of all existing targets and ground followup of remotely and conceptually generated aois to generate additional new targets the belt scale exploration strategy of randgold is to focus on the discovery of large high quality gold deposits by rapidly identifying and progressing targets that show the potential to meet these filters resources of greater than two million ounces of gold have already been identified within the ngayu greenstone belt in the makapela and adumbi deposits and the objective is to further unlock the potential of the

twangizanamoya gold belt owned by banro corporation and the kilomoto gold belt previously controlled by moto gold and now by randgold and anglogold ashanti the main provincial centres within the project area are butembo and lubero to date loncor had identified ten gold prospects for follow up the most prospective being the manguredjipa prospect where  ounces of alluvial gold was mined during the colonial period other gold prospects warranting follow up include lutunguru lubero makwasu lutela bilolo manzia mohanga and lundjulu this is an area that has never been explored using modern exploration techniques geology and history the loncor properties are located within the kibaran orogenic belt consisting of archean greenstones and proterozoic metasediments which have experienced a protracted history of tectonism volcanism and metamorphism the kibaran orogenic belt is primarily prospective for gold and platinum minerals but also has potential to host tin niobium tantalum tungsten beryllium copper and cobalt the belgian company miniere des grands lacs mgl mined alluvial gold and platinum on loncors north kivu permits between the s and s in the manguredipa area alone over  oz of alluvial gold and platinum were extracted mgls alluvial operations eventually led to the discovery of numerous primary highgrade quartz veins stockworks and disseminated gold deposits see map below these deposits were tested by mgl during the s and s by trenching adits and diamond drilling however low gold prices and civil unrest caused the cessation of activities in  nongold mineral potential in addition to gold there are a number of alluvial platinum occurrences in the project area including the type locality for the platinum selenide mineral luberoite near lubero to date no primary source has been found for the alluvial platinum occurrences although the priority is gold and platinum the north kivu project permits also have a number of niobium rare earths tantalum copper iron and diamond occurrences rock sampling and geological mapping will be undertaken on some of these including the bingo carbonatite that contains significant amounts of pyrochlore niobiumtantalum to determine whether more detailed follow up is required exploration program in  loncor conducted airborne radiometric and geophysical surveys  line kilometres of its prs followup interpretation yielded several anomalies with possible primary gold mineralization the program will focus on the most advanced gold prospect within the north kivu project area manguredjipa where exploration began in  in the vicinity of the known gold occurrences in addition regional exploration will be undertaken on the additional nine identified gold prospects found elsewhere within the north kivu project area followup will also be undertaken on the alluvial platinum occurrences in the lubero area to determine the primary source of this precious metal click to enlarge click to enlarge click to enlarge click to
