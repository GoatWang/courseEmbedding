sell production equipment to buyers on an international basis we have a twenty year contract with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd and will work towards modernizing production technology to make sure that individuals and producers the world over may economically produce natural fertilizer for example the harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd currently produces  tons of natural fertilizer annually in  at the local county in which they reside half of the  villages there used harbin haixin biological fertilizer co products and the acreage utilizing the product totaled  mu harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd currently forecasts that sales of fertilizer will grow to  tons annually with a total investment profit of    the company entered a cooperation agreement to form a joint venture with an unrelated foreign company on october   the agreement “merely creates a trading relationship” with our potential joint venture partner and lays out the intent of the partners for the terms of a joint venture the agreement confirms their mutual intent to identify and work for certain projects together in the next  years there is no time limit for the start of the joint venture and the agreement merely creates a trading relationship at this time if the parties enter into a formal joint venture in the future the registrants percentage will be  of the joint venture the trading partner is a well established entity in the prc operating and generating revenue for a number of years   harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd currently produces  tons of natural fertilizer annually in  half of the  villages in the local county there used haixin brand organic fertilizer the acreage utilizing the product totaled more than  million square meter according to harbin haizin biological fertilizer co ltd harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd currently forecasts that sales of fertilizer will grow to  tons annually with a total investment profit of  rmb   the other party to the cooperation intent joint venture agreement was formed in  and has  employees according to information provided by the company green industries are very popular and growing especially in the heilongjiang province in china   the chinese party to the cooperation agreement is located in heilongjiang province china the following are taken from “overview of green food industry in heilongjiang china” provided by the department of commerce of heilongjiang province   heilongjiang located in the northeast of china is the northernmost province and of the highest latitude in china named after the largest river inside its territory             heilongjiang habitats the cold temperate zone continental monsoon climate with an average temperature altering from degrees to degrees c long winters high temperature abundant rainfall and long sunshine period in summers which is appropriate for the growth of crops in addition as heilongjiang possesses one of the three world famous black soil zones the organic content of the soil is higher than other parts of china black soil chernozem and meadow soil occupying more than  of its arable land as a result heilongjiang is an important commodity grain base and green food processing base in china the home of food crops like soybean rice corn wheat and potato and of economic crops like sugar beet flax and cured tomato being one of the key pasturing areas heilongjiang boasts millionhectacre grasslands with high quality forage of highvalue nutrition proper for developing animal husbandry   in the early s heilong started to develop green food products until  the areas certified by green food standard have reached  hectacres one quarter of the total areas in china nationallevel standardized material production base of green food has extended to  hectacres half of the total amount in china the total output of green food in heilong has achieved  metric tons the total output value over  billion rmb yuan there are  green food manufacturers that can produce eight types of food including green rice dairy and mountain products etc apart from that there have been over  green food sales outlets at home and more than  sales outlets at abroad mostly in the us japan and southeast asia by the end of  the certificated area of place of origin of green food will have reached  hectacres a predicted output of  metric tons   in  green organic food processing enterprises in the province developed to  sales income reached rmb  billion yuan  green food products were awarded as “famous brand in china”   under the contract with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd if the joint venture moves forward the company will be a  partner in a joint venture for the production of organic biological fertilizer and organic rice the duties of the company under the contract are a  capital contribution to assist the purchase in the united states of the facilities and equipment needed in the project and shipped to chinese ports to assist in all relevant matters such as the purchase of machinery and equipment and materials outside china commissioned by the parties to provide the needed equipment for installation debugging and trial production as well as technical personnel production and testing technicians to train the technical personnel and workers required by the project to assist and handle the related formalities for chinese workers of the project to enter the united states and to be responsible for handling other matters entrusted by the partners   we will work hard to scour the united states and elsewhere for companies producing the very best in the industrialscale agricultural equipment used in producing natural fertilizer it may take us several months to build a network of business contacts to facilitate the commencement of purchase of equipment once adequate efficiencies are achieved in logistics and supply we may begin an international marketing campaign at first maximizing the personal contacts of our founders to guarantee a suitable market for our products   the company plans especially to target the lucrative china market according to our research  of the chinese market would amount to  tons of natural fertilizer sales each ton of natural fertilizer sells for  to  rmb in areas such as heilongjiang province in china which is experiencing a boom in rice production  mu of land in  natural fertilizer is in especially high demand production of that amount of fertilizer will call for a large amount of modern equipment which we plan to be able to provide to such companies   developing an adequate knowledgebase in terms of the regulations governing import and export of such equipment and the network of providers and manufacturers involved will take some time that is why we plan to spend a considerable amount of labor and effort in obtaining the requisite knowledge andor recruiting suitable personnel to do the job   according to the october

as of december   we had no employees including management all work is done on a sub contract basis we have no agreements with any of our managementsubcontractors for any services we consider our relations with our subcontractors to be good the company does not carry key person life insurance on any of its directorial personnel the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other directors could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the company the companys future success also depends on its ability to retain and attract highly qualified technical and managerial personnel      there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key managerial and technical personnel or that it will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future the inability to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel necessary to support the growth of the companys business due to among other things a large increase in the wages demanded by such personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the companys business results of operations and financial condition   item a   risk factors   risks relating to our business   foreign officers and directors could result in difficulty enforcing rights   the officers and directors of the company are located in china and as such investors may have difficulty in enforcing their legal rights under the united states securities laws   the prolonged downturn in the global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations   the global market and economic conditions during the years  through  are unprecedented and challenging with recessions occurring in most major economies continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential longterm and widespread recession energy costs geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world the difficult economic outlook has negatively affected businesses and consumer confidence and contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels   the prc economy faces challenges the prc government has implemented various measures to curb inflation if economic growth continues to slow or the economic downturn continues our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected              we may not maintain sufficient insurance coverage for the risks associated with our business operations   risks associated with our business and operations include but are not limited to claims for wrongful acts committed by our officers directors employees and other representatives the loss of intellectual property rights the loss of key personnel and risks posed by natural disasters any of these risks may result in significant losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover any losses that we may sustain or that we will be able to successfully claim our losses under our insurance policies on a timely basis or at all if we incur any loss not covered by our insurance policies or the compensated amount is significantly less than our actual loss or is not timely paid our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected   we will not own  of the equity interests in the potential joint venture which may not be as stable and effective in providing operational control as  ownership and potential exists for conflict of interests   we operate our business through our future joint venture arrangement with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd the company entered a cooperation agreement to form a joint venture with an unrelated foreign company on october   the agreement confirms their mutual intent to identify and work for certain projects together in the next  yearsthe agreement “merely creates a trading relationship” with our potential joint venture partner and lays out the intent of the partners for the terms of a joint venture if there are disagreements between harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd and us regarding the business and operations of the joint venture we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to resolve those disagreements in a manner that will be in our best interests in addition harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd may i have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours ii take actions contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives iii be unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations iv have financial difficulties or v have disputes with us as to the scope of its responsibilities and obligations any of these and other factors may materially and adversely affect the performance of the joint venture which may in turn materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   any failure by the future joint venture to perform its obligations pursuant to applicable third party contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   if the joint venture fails to perform its obligations pursuant to applicable third party contractual arrangements we may have to incur substantial costs in connection with any dispute resolution regarding enforcement of those arrangements and rely on legal remedies available pursuant to applicable prc laws all of these contractual arrangements are governed by prc law the company entered a cooperation agreement to form a joint venture with an unrelated foreign company on october   the agreement confirms their mutual intent to identify and work for certain projects together in the next  yearsthe agreement “merely creates a trading relationship” with our potential joint venture partner and lays out the intent of the partners for the terms of a joint venture the legal environment in china is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions such as the united states   if the applicable prc authorities invalidate these contractual arrangements for violation of prc laws and regulations by the joint venture the joint venture terminates the contractual arrangements or the joint venture fails to perform its obligations pursuant to those contractual arrangements the joint venture’s business operations would be materially disrupted and our revenue could decrease substantially   in addition if all or part of the joint venture’s assets become subject to liens or rights of third party creditors the joint venture may be unable to continue some or all of its business which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if the joint venture becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding its unrelated thirdparty creditors may claim rights to some or all of its assets which could materially harm our business and our ability to generate revenue and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly   we do not have a set date for the starting of the joint venture making the date of the start of operations uncertain   we do not have a set date for the starting of the joint venture making the date of the start of operations uncertain and thus the company may never have any revenues   unmerited legal actions or threats by our employees consultants or other associates in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from us could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation   in recent years as the number of foreign companies doing business in china has increased there has been an increasing number of unmerited legal actions and threats by current and former employees consultants or other associates of these companies in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from them we may face increasing risks of similar legal actions and threats although we expect to vigorously defend ourselves against any such actions if we believe they are frivolous we cannot provide any assurance that we will prevail in those actions or will not be subject to any material liability as a result of those actions furthermore regardless of success in our legal defenses those actions and the threats of those actions would probably be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve and would divert our management’s time and attention our reputation and profitability may also be harmed as a result              we depend upon the joint venture’s acquisition and maintenance of licenses to conduct its business in the prc   in order to conduct its business the joint venture will be required to obtain and maintain various licenses from the appropriate chinese government authorities including general business licenses and permits specific to its operations we can provide no assurance that the joint venture will be successful in obtaining all of the appropriate licenses and permits to conduct its business nor can we provide any assurance that if those licenses or permits are acquired those licenses and permits will be renewed   the prc government may amend relevant laws and discontinue approval of renewal of certain licenses or permits further fees for such licenses or permits may increase in the future the joint venture’s failure to obtain or maintain those licenses or permits and any change of the relevant prc laws regarding the appropriate licenses or permits to the joint venture’s disadvantage will have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition also if increasing compliance costs associated with governmental standards and regulations restrict or prohibit any part of the joint venture’s operations it may adversely affect our profitability   material weaknesses in our internal controls and financial reporting and our lack of a chief financial officer with sufficient us gaap experience may limit our ability to prevent or detect financial misstatements or omissions as a result our financial reports may not be in compliance with us gaap any material weakness misstatement or omission in our financial statements will negatively affect the market and the price of our stock which could result in significant loss to our investors   none of the members of our current management has experience managing and operating a public company and they rely in many instances on the professional experience and advice of third parties while we are obligated to hire a qualified chief financial officer to enable us to satisfy our reporting obligations as a us public company we do not have a chief financial officer with any significant us gaap experience presently although we are actively seeking such a chief financial officer qualified individuals are often difficult to find or the individual may not have all of the qualifications that we require   therefore we may in turn experience “weakness” and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under section  of the “sarbanesoxley” act of  this “weakness” also includes a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls as such requirements are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  moreover effective internal controls particularly those related to revenue recognition are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our business and operating results could be harmed investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock if a market ever develops could drop significantly   pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act we are required to include in our annual reports our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal years we have not yet completed any assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management’s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification   we conduct our business by means of a joint venture arrangement if the chinese government determines that this arrangement does not comply with applicable regulations our business could be adversely affected if the prc regulatory agencies determine that the agreements that establish the structure and relationship for operating our business in china do not comply with prc regulatory restrictions on foreign investment we could be subject to severe penalties in addition changes in such chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business   there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of prc laws rules and regulations including but not limited to the laws rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of the joint venture arrangement between harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd and us although we believe based on our understanding of the current prc laws rules and regulations the structure for operating our business in china including the joint venture arrangement with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd complies with all applicable prc laws rules and regulations and does not violate breach contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable prc laws rules or regulations we cannot assure you that the prc regulatory authorities will not determine that such joint venture arrangement does not violate prc laws rules or regulations if the prc regulatory authorities determine that our joint venture arrangement with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd is in violation of applicable prc laws rules or regulations such joint venture arrangement may become invalid or unenforceable which will substantially affect our operations adversely              the chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations including levying fines revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance in particular licenses and permits issued or granted by relevant governmental agencies may be revoked at a later time by other regulatory agencies we cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new chinese laws or regulations on our business any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our operations which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   noncompliance with the social insurance and housing fund contribution regulations in the prc could lead to imposition of penalties or other liabilities   the prc governmental authorities have passed a variety of laws and regulations regarding social insurance and housing funds such as the regulation of insurance for labor injury the regulation of insurance for unemployment the provisional insurance measures for maternity of employees interim provisions on registration of social insurance interim regulation on the collection and payment of social insurance premiums regulations on management of housing fund and other related laws and regulations pursuant to these regulations we will be required to obtain and renew the social insurance registration certificate and the housing fund certificate and make enough contributions to the relevant local social insurance and housing fund authorities for our prc employees failure to comply with such laws and regulations would subject us to various fines and legal sanctions and supplemental contributions to the local social insurance and housing fund authorities the companies funding requirements will be funded through equity debt or related party loans   we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act   we are required to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act which prohibits us companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business foreign companies including some of our competitors are not subject to these prohibitions corruption extortion bribery payoffs theft and other fraudulent practices occur from timetotime in the prc if our competitors engage in these practices they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies giving those competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses which would put us at a disadvantage we could suffer severe penalties if our employees or other agents were determined to have engaged in such practices   if we are unable to retain key personnel it will have an adverse effect on our business we do not maintain “key man” life insurance policies on our key personnel   the conduct of our business is dependent on retaining the services of qualified personnel the loss of key management the inability to secure or retain such key personnel with unique knowledge of our business or our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of other qualified personnel would adversely affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition   we do not have “key man” life insurance policies for any of our key personnel if we were to obtain “key man” insurance for our key personnel of which there can be no assurance the amounts of such policies may not be sufficient to pay losses experienced by us as a result of the loss of any of those personnel   risks related to doing business in china   the prc labor contract law and its implementing rules may adversely affect our business and results of operations   on june   the standing committee of the national people’s congress of china enacted the labor contract law which became effective on january   on september   the state council adopted the implementing rules for the labor contract law which became effective upon adoption this labor law and its implementing rules have reinforced the protection for employees who under the existing prc labor law already have certain rights such as the right to have written labor contracts the right to enter into labor contracts with no fixed terms under specific circumstances the right to receive overtime wages when working overtime and the right to terminate or alter terms in the labor contracts in addition the labor contract law and its implementing rules have made some amendments to the existing prc labor law and added some clauses that could increase cost of labor to employers for example under the labor contract law employers are required to base their decisions to dismiss employees on seniority as opposed to merit under certain circumstances as the labor contract law and its implementing rules are relatively new there remains significant uncertainty as to their interpretation and application by the prc government authorities at this time there are no operations of the registrant in the prc but in the future employees such as a sales force or marketing may be employed in the prc and such labor laws would increase our labor cost and thus lower the registrants profitability in the event that we decide to significantly reduce our workforce the labor contract law and its implementing rules could adversely affect our ability to effect these changes costeffectively or in the manner we desire which could lead to a negative impact on our business and results of operations              due to the nature of our business we will be subject to certain environmental regulation in the prc our operations are subject to environmental and safety regulation in the prc such regulation covers a wide variety of matters including without limitation prevention of waste pollution and protection of the environment labor regulations and worker safety in particular the acceptable level of pollution and the potential cleanup costs and obligations and liability for toxic or hazardous substances for which we may become liable as a result of our activities may be impossible to assess against the current legal framework and current enforcement practices of the prc in addition environmental legislation and permit regimes are likely to evolve in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement increased fines and penalties for noncompliance more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their directors and employees   adverse changes in economic and political policies of the prc government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china which could adversely affect our business   a significant portion of our business operations is conducted in the prc accordingly our results of operations financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic political and legal developments in china china’s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including with respect to the amount of government involvement level of development growth rate control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources while the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past  years or so growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of china the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources while some of these measures benefit the overall prc economy they may also have a negative effect on us for example our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us   although the prc government has implemented measures since the late s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises the prc government still owns a substantial portion of productive assets in china in addition the prc government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies the prc government also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies actions and policies of the prc government could materially affect our ability to operate our business which could adversely affect our business   we face risks related to health epidemics severe weather conditions and other catastrophes which could materially and adversely affect our business   our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars another health epidemic severe weather conditions or other catastrophes in april  influenza a hn a new strain of flu virus commonly referred to as “swine flu” was first discovered in north america and quickly spread to other parts of the world including china in january and february  a series of severe winter storms inflicted extensive damages and significantly disrupted people’s lives in large portions of southern and central china in may  an earthquake measuring  on the richter scale hit sichuan province in southwestern china causing huge casualties and property damages because the vast majority of our business operations is conducted in china and rely heavily on the efforts of persons residing in china any prolonged recurrence of avian flu or sars or the occurrence of other adverse public health developments such as influenza a hn severe weather conditions such as the massive snow storms in january and february  and other catastrophes such as the sichuan earthquake may significantly disrupt our operations thus causing a material and adverse effect on our business   uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could adversely affect us   we conduct our business primarily through our joint venture relationship with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd in china our operations in china are governed by prc laws and regulations accordingly we are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in china the prc legal system is based on written statutes prior court decisions may be used for reference but have limited precedential value   although since  prc legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in china china has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in china in particular because these laws and regulations are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties that could limit the reliability of the legal protections available to us in addition the prc legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all that may have a retroactive effect as a result we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention             we cannot predict the effects of future developments in the prc legal system we may be required in the future to procure additional permits authorizations and approvals for operations which may not be obtainable in a timely fashion or at all an inability to obtain such permits or authorizations may have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations   any deterioration of political relations among the united states and the prc could impair our operations   the relationship between the united states and the prc is subject to sudden fluctuation and periodic tension changes in political conditions in the prc and changes in the state of sinous relations are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations such a change could lead to a decline in our profitability any weakening of relations among the united states and the prc could have a material adverse effect on our operations   fluctuation in the value of the rmb may have a material adverse effect on your investment   the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions on july   the prc government changed its decadeold policy of pegging the value of the rmb to the us dollar under the new policy the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies this change in policy has resulted in significant appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar since that change however under the current global financial and economic conditions it is impossible to predict with any certainty how the rmb will move visàvis the us dollar in the future   we will rely entirely on distribution of funds paid to us as our share of the profits of the joint venture which has its operations in china any significant appreciation or depreciation of the rmb against the us dollar may affect our cash flows revenues earnings and financial position for example an appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar would make any new rmbdenominated investments or expenditures more costly to us to the extent that we are required to convert us dollars into the rmb for such purposes conversely a significant depreciation of the rmb against the us dollar may significantly reduce the us dollar equivalent of our reported earnings and adversely affect the price of our common stock   compensation for our future employees may make us potentially less profitable in recent years compensation in various industries in china has increased and may continue to increase in the future in order to attract and retain skilled personnel we may need to increase the compensation of our employees compensation may also increase as inflationary pressure increases in china in addition under the regulations on paid annual leave for employees which became effective on january   employees who have served more than one year for a specific employer are entitled to a paid vacation ranging from  to  days depending on length of service employees who waive such vacation time at the request of employers must be compensated for three times their normal salaries for each waived vacation day this mandated paidvacation regulation coupled with the trend of increasing compensation may result in increase in our employeerelated costs and expenses and decrease in our profit margins   prc regulation of direct investments in prc entities by offshore companies may delay or prevent us from contributing our funds to the joint venture any funds we contribute to the joint venture may be subject to approval by or registration with relevant governmental authorities in china according to the relevant prc regulations regarding foreigninvested enterprises in china capital contributions to the joint venture may be subject to the approval of the prc ministry of commerce or its local branches such authorities are required to conclude the approval process regarding capital contribution within  days there is no statutory requirement in the prc to complete such registration process within certain time period the prc government does not charge any fee for any of the foregoing approvals and registrations process   in addition on august   safe promulgated circular  a notice regulating the conversion by a foreigninvested company of foreign currency into rmb by restricting how the converted rmb may be used circular  requires that rmb converted from the foreign currencydenominated capital of a foreigninvested company may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the prc unless specifically provided for otherwise in its business scope in addition the state administration of foreign exchange “safe” strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of rmb funds converted from the foreign currencydenominated capital of a foreigninvested company the use of such rmb fund may not be changed without approval from safe or its local counterparts violations of circular  may result in severe penalties including substantial fines as set forth in the foreign exchange administration regulations              we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain the required government registrations or approvals on a timely basis if at all with respect to contributions made by us to the joint venture if we fail to receive such registrations or approvals our ability to contribute to the capital of the joint venture would be negatively affected which would adversely and materially affect our business as the registrant does not yet have funds to start the joint venture and only have established a trading relationship at this time no application has been prepared or submitted to the prc ministry of commerce for approval of the joint venture contribution   we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” for prc enterprise income tax purposes such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our nonprc shareholders   under the prc enterprise income tax law or the new eit law and its implementing rules both effective from january   an enterprise established outside of china with “de facto management bodies” within china is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to enterprise income tax at the rate of  on its worldwide income the implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations personnel accounting properties etc of an enterprise the state administration of taxation issued the notice regarding the determination of chinesecontrolled offshore incorporated enterprises as prc tax resident enterprises on the basis of de facto management bodies  or circular  on april   circular  provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a chinesecontrolled offshore incorporated enterprise is located in china which include all of the following conditions  the location where senior management members responsible for an enterprise’s daily operations discharge their duties  the location where financial and human resource decisions are made or approved by organizations or persons  the location where the major assets and corporate documents are kept and  the location where more than half of all directors with voting rights or senior management have their habitual residence however the eit law and its implementing rules are relatively new and ambiguous in terms of certain definitions requirements and detailed procedures and currently no official interpretation or application of the “resident enterprise” definition is available therefore it is unclear how prc tax authorities will determine the tax residency of each company based on the facts and circumstances of the specific company if we are treated as a resident enterprise for prc tax purposes we will be subject to prc tax on our worldwide income at the  uniform tax rate which could have an impact on our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations although dividends distributed from our prc subsidiaries to us could be exempt from prc dividend withholding tax since such income is exempted under the new eit law to a prc resident recipient   although circular  only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups not those controlled by prc individuals or foreign individuals the determining criteria set forth in circular  may indicate the state administration of taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises regardless of whether they are controlled by the prc enterprises or prc enterprise groups or individuals or by foreign individuals if we were considered as a prc “resident enterprise” we would be subject to a prc enterprise income tax on our worldwide income at a tax rate of    in addition under the new eit law and its implementation regulations issued by the state council a  prc withholding tax is applicable unless otherwise reduced or exempted by relevant tax treaties to dividends paid by a prc resident enterprise to investors that are “nonresident enterprises” which do not have an establishment or place of business in the prc or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the prc similarly if we are considered a “prc resident enterprise” any gain realized on the transfer of our common stock by investors is also subject to prc tax at a rate of  unless otherwise reduced or exempted by relevant tax treaties if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the prc if we were considered a prc resident enterprise it is unclear whether dividends paid on our common stock or any gain realized from the transfer of our common stock would be treated as income derived from sources within the prc and would as a result be subject to prc taxation it is also unclear whether if we are considered a prc resident enterprise holders of our common stock would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into among china and other countries or areas if dividends payable to our nonprc investors or gains from the transfer of our common stock by such investors are subject to prc tax the value of your investment in our common stock may be materially and adversely affected              there are differences between prc and us generally accepted accounting principles our profits will be derived from the business of the joint venture which is established in the prc the profits available for distribution for companies established in the prc are determined in accordance with prc accounting standards which may differ from the amounts determined under us gaap in the event that the amount of the profits determined under the prc accounting standard in a given year is less than that determined under the us gaap our results of operations may be affected adversely   future inflation in china may inhibit economic activity and adversely affect our operations the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion in recent years which has resulted in high rates of inflation and deflation this has caused the prc government to from time to time enact various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation significant inflation may in the future cause the prc government to once again impose controls on credit andor prices or to take other action which could inhibit economic activity in china any action on the part of the prc government that seeks to control credit andor prices may adversely affect our business   we may be restricted from freely converting the renminbi “rmb” to other currencies in a timely manner at the present time the rmb is not a freely convertible currency we will receive the vast majority of our revenue in rmb which may need to be converted to other currencies primarily us dollars in order to be remitted outside of the prc effective july   foreign currency “current account” transactions by foreign investment enterprises are no longer subject to the approval of state administration of foreign exchange “safe” but need only a ministerial review according to the administration of the settlement sale and payment of foreign exchange provisions promulgated in  the “fx regulations” “current account” items include international commercial transactions which occur on a regular basis such as those relating to trade and provision of services distributions to participants also are considered “current account transactions” other noncurrent account items known as “capital account” items remain subject to safe approval under current regulations we can obtain foreign currency in exchange for rmb from swap centers authorized by the government no assurance can be given that foreign currency shortages or changes in currency exchange laws and regulations by the prc government will not restrict us from freely converting rmb in a timely manner   approval from appropriate government authorities is required where rmb is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay capital expenses the prc government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions under our joint venture structure the primary source of our income will be payments from the joint venture which is subject to china law shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the joint venture to remit sufficient foreign currency to make payments to us or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency needs our operations will be adversely affected   if we make equity compensation grants to persons who are prc citizens they may be required to register with safe we may also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt equity compensation plans for our directors and employees under prc laws   in  the prc state administration of foreign exchange “safe” promulgated regulations which require registrations with and approval from safe on direct or indirect offshore investment activities by prc legal person resident andor natural person resident on april   safe issued the “operating procedures for administration of domestic individuals participating in the employee stock ownership plan or stock option plan of an overseas listed company” also known as “circular ” it is not clear whether circular  covers all forms of equity compensation plans or only those which provide for the granting of stock options for any plans which are so covered and are adopted by a nonprc listed company such as us after april   circular  requires all participants who are prc citizens to register with and obtain approvals from safe prior to their participation in any such plan   if we adopt an employee stock option plan or any other equity incentive plan and make stock option grants under any such plan to our officers directors and employees some of whom are prc citizens they may be required to register with safe if it is determined that any of our equity compensation plans are subject to circular  failure to comply with such provisions may subject us and participants of our equity compensation plans who are prc citizens to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our prc employees in that case our ability to compensate our employees and directors through equity compensation would be hindered and our business operations may be adversely affected we believe that the registration and approval requirements contemplated in circular  will be burdensome and time consuming              safe regulations relating to offshore investment activities by prc residents may increase our administrative burdens if our shareholders who are prc residents fail to make any required applications registrations and filings under such regulations we may be unable to distribute profits and may become subject to liability under prc laws   safe has promulgated several regulations including notice on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange administration for prc residents to engage in financing and inbound investment via oversea special purpose vehicles or “circular no ” issued on october   and effective as of november   and certain implementation rules issued in recent years requiring registrations with and approvals from prc government authorities in connection with direct or indirect offshore investment activities by prc residents and prc corporate entities these regulations apply to our shareholders and beneficial owners who are prc residents   although we have requested our prc shareholders to complete the safe circular no  registration there is no assurance that all of our prc shareholders will be able to comply with the requirements imposed by circular  the failure or inability of our prc shareholders to receive any required approvals or make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions limit our ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure as a result of which our operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and adversely affected   contractual arrangements entered into may be subject to audits or challenges by the prc tax authorities and a finding that we may owe taxes could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations under applicable prc laws rules and regulations arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audits or challenges by the prc tax authorities we cannot assure you that each of our transactions with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd will be regarded by the prc tax authorities as arm’slength transactions the relevant tax authorities may determine that our contractual relationships with harbin haixin biological fertilizer co ltd were not entered into on an arm’slength basis if the prc tax authorities determine that any of those transactions are not on an arm’s length basis or result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable prc laws rules and regulations the prc tax authorities may adjust our income expenses profits and losses which could in turn increase our tax liabilities in addition the prc tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties for underpaid taxes our net income may be adversely and materially affected if our tax liabilities increase or if it is found to be subject to late payment fees or other penalties      item b   unresolved staff comments   none   item    properties   the company leases space at  e colorado blvd  pasadena ca  we believe that this space is adequate for our needs at this

internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles it should be noted however that because of inherent limitations any system of internal controls however welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that financial reporting objectives will be met in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   an internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their work our chief executive officer also performing the functions of the principal financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission the coso criteria based on that

significant accounting policies   a summary of significant accounting policies of usdadi fertilizer industry international inc the company is presented to assist in understanding the company’s financial statements the accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements these financial statements and notes are representations of the company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity   organization nature of business and trade name   the company was incorporated in the state of california on august   the company is a fertilizerrelated products and equipment exporter   basis of presentation   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period actual results could differ from those estimates management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  all valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all shortterm debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   revenue and cost recognition   the company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date the company currently does not have a means for generating revenue revenue and cost recognition procedures will be implemented based on the type of properties required and sale contract specifications     f       usdadi fertilizer industry international inc notes to financial statements december   and    note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   fair value of financial instruments   the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability   the company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data   in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  a change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented     f        usdadi fertilizer industry international inc notes to financial statements december   and    note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   capital stock   the company had authorized two hundred and fifty million  shares of common stock with no par value on june   the company amended its articles of incorporation with the state of california to increase authorized shares of common stock to  shares with no par value there were  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december   and    income taxes   the company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income regardless of when reported for tax purposes   recently issued accounting pronouncements   recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force the aicpa and the sec did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company’s present or future consolidated financial statements   note  – going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with research and development the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse affect upon it and its shareholders     f         usdadi fertilizer industry international inc notes to financial statements december   and  note  – income taxes   we did not provide any current or deferred us federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception  when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the company must allow for this future tax benefit  we provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset consisting of net operating loss carry forwards because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period   the company has not taken a tax position that if challenged would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years ended december  or  applicable under fasb asc   we did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet   all tax returns for the company remain open   the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes the sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows             income tax provision at the federal statutory rate       effect on operating losses             —       changes in the net deferred tax assets consist of the following                     net operating loss carry forward             valuation allowance             net deferred tax asset    —        —       a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate is as follows           tax at statutory rate              increase in valuation allowance             net deferred tax asset    —        —       the net federal operating loss carry forward will expire in   this carry forward may be limited upon the consummation of a business combination under irc section      f       usdadi fertilizer industry international inc notes to financial statements december   and  note  – common stock   during the year ended december   the company issued a total of  shares for services valued at    there were  shares issued and outstanding at december   and    note   related party transactions   the company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property  the officers and directors for the company are involved in other business activities and may in the future become involved in other business opportunities  if a specific business opportunity becomes available such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the company and their other business interest  the company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts   the company received advances from related parties totaling  and  during the years ended december   and  the advances from related parties are due on demand with no interest incurred there was  and  due to related parties as of december   and    note   joint venture for potential projects   the company entered a joint venture agreement with an unrelated foreign company on october   the agreement confirms their mutual intent to identify and work for certain projects together in the next  years the joint venture will be officially started once the company has raised enough capital and lucrative business opportunity is identified  in according with asc “variable interest entity” or vie in order to qualify as a vie the entity should have one or more than one party meets the economic criterion of a primary beneficiary but only one party will have power  a reporting entity does not have to exercise its power to have power rather the focus is on who has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic if so that entity needs to perform the consolidation  as stated above the company entered a jv agreement with the other party however the agreement has not been started as of the filing date because there is not enough capital being raised and the business has not been identified yet  if the agreement started the company will consider which party has the power and has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic and the company will consider who needs to be performed the consolidation on its book     note  – subsequent events   the company evaluated all events or transactions

recommendupdated on june  validated reviewwhat do you like bestresponse to email enquirycustomer care was excellent and not what i expectedwhat do you dislikethat the report linker site only provided broad overview information when it seemed to promise something more specific and tailored i was unable to preview before i bought the service however once i had paid i was unable to find anything remotely like the search engne had promised i felt very let down particularly as i had spoken to eport link staff and tried to get a preview i actually felt a bit duped my enquiry was followed up and what happened to my request was very unusual someone actually listened and took ownership i really did not expect this and had written off the fee as a bad experience i then received a further emaila dn offer to assist when the member of staff was unable to i was offered a refund that is going above and beyond very well done to report linker this is far better thatn i expected and my respect for
