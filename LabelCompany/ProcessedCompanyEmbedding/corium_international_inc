sale of  shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares based on the initial public offering price of  per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purpose of this offering is to create a public market for our common stock we intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering as follows • approximately  million to  million for phase  clinical trials for microcor hpth and corplex tamsulosin • approximately  million to  million for scale up of production capability for our microcor products • approximately  million to  million for formulation and development of our proprietary corplex products • approximately  million to  million for advancement of our microcor technology • approximately  million for the repurchase of shares of common stock pursuant to the recapitalization described in more detail in related party transactions—recapitalization and • any remaining balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes we may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to inlicense acquire or invest in complementary businesses technologies products or assets however we have no current plan commitments or obligations to do so pending other uses we intend to invest the proceeds in interestbearing investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government or hold as cash we cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from our initial public offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products we face competition from other companies in numerous industries including pharmaceuticals and drug delivery we believe the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of our products and the development of our product candidates include onset of action bioavailability efficacy compliance cost convenience of dosing safety and tolerability profile companies focused on delivering small molecules transdermally include m johnson  johnson lohmann therapies systems or lts mylan hisamitsu or noven and actavis companies operating in the microneedle transdermal field include m zosano theraject and fujifilm several academic institutions are also conducting research in the microneedle field in addition to microneedle technologies there are other methods of transdermal delivery under development for biologics including heat ablation laser ultrasound and radio frequency companies developing and manufacturing transdermal systems for biologics include becton dickinson vyteris and zogenix some of these companies may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are our current products compete and products in development will compete in highly competitive markets against both transdermal products and products addressing similar patient and customer needs through other delivery forms clonidine tds fentanyl tds and our future anda products will have competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies including mylan and actavis both of which have their own transdermal manufacturing capability other manufacturers of fentanyl patches use a different technology than ours and although fentanyl patches made with either technology have experienced manufacturing challenges competitors may claim their technology is superior the crest whitestrips products compete with teeth whitening products marketed by various private labels such as those at walgreens and cvs many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial research and development and human resources than we do may succeed in obtaining patent protection before us and have greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals for product candidates consequently our competitors are applying significant resources and experience to the problems of drug delivery and transdermal drug delivery in particular we cannot assure you that our transdermal delivery systems will compete effectively against existing and future transdermal or other delivery systems company description we are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that leverage our broad experience in transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems together with our partners we have successfully developed six marketed products in the prescription drug and consumer markets and we are the sole commercial supplier of each of those products for our marketing partners these marketed products are clonidine transdermal delivery system or tds fentanyl tds and four crest advanced seal whitestrips products we use our novel transdermal and transmucosal approaches to bring new products to markets with significant opportunities our development platforms enable transdermal delivery of large molecules or biologics including vaccines peptides and proteins as well as small molecules that are otherwise difficult to deliver in a transdermal dosage form our pipeline includes three partnered products that are the subject of pending drug marketing applications to the us food and drug administration or fda in addition we have  partner or selffunded programs at earlier stages since  we have built significant knowhow and experience in the development scaleup and manufacture of complex specialty products and have formed relationships with our partners that include both the development of new product formulations and our manufacture of the resulting products our partners include the procter  gamble company or pg par pharmaceutical inc teva pharmaceuticals usa inc and agile therapeutics inc as well as several other multinational pharmaceutical companies we have the capability to develop and manufacture our own product candidates and are one of only a few independent companies that develops and manufactures transdermal products for other parties we believe our proprietary manufacturing processes knowhow and custom equipment give us a distinct competitive advantage over other pharmaceutical consumer products and manufacturing companies transdermal drug delivery is the transport of drugs through the skin for absorption into the body we have developed two proprietary technology platforms corplex and microcor that we believe offer significant competitive advantages over existing transdermal approaches corplex and microcor are designed to be adapted broadly for use in multiple drug categories and indications we use our corplex technology to create advanced transdermal and transmucosal systems for small molecules that utilize less of the active ingredient while achieving the same or better therapeutic effect that can adhere well to either wet or dry surfaces and that can hold additional ingredients required to aid the diffusion of lowsolubility molecules through the skin without losing adhesion our microcor technology is a biodegradable microstructure system currently in development that enables the painless and convenient delivery of biologics that otherwise must be delivered via injection biodegradable microstructures integrate drug molecules and a biocompatible polymer with slight external pressure the microstructures penetrate the outer layers of the skin and dissolve to release the drug for local or systemic absorption microcor is designed to expand the market for transdermal delivery of biologics which cannot currently be delivered by other fdaapproved transdermal technologies in addition to commercialized products we have a number of products in late stages of development the most advanced clinical stage product in our pipeline is ag which is in phase  development by our exclusive marketing partner agile ag is a combined hormonal contraceptive patch designed to deliver two hormones ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel through the skin at levels comparable to lowdose oral contraceptives in an easytouse format over seven days agile has filed a new drug application or nda for approval of this product by the fda which is required before marketing a new drug in the united states the fda has indicated that agiles nda was not sufficient for approval as originally submitted agile is preparing to conduct an additional phase  clinical trial based on this guidance and intends to supplement the nda with the results of the additional phase  clinical trial based on market research conducted by agile ag has the potential to reach a peak market share of  of hormonal contraceptive prescriptions in the united states based upon ims data agile estimates that each percentage point of market share of hormonal contraceptive prescriptions in the united states currently represents approximately  million of annual gross sales we are developing two additional products utilizing our proprietary technologies that we plan to advance into phase  trials in  and  microcor hpth utilizes our microcor technology to deliver parathyroid hormone a peptide for treating osteoporosis that is currently available only in a refrigerated injectable form corplex tamsulosin is a patch being developed to deliver tamsulosin to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or enlarged prostate tamsulosin is a drug that relaxes smooth muscle cells in the prostate and bladder neck thereby decreasing the blockage of urine flow that occurs with an enlarged prostate it is designed to deliver a controlled dose over several days and to reduce side effects compared to currently marketed products we are not aware of any fdaapproved transdermal systems for delivering either hpth or tamsulosin
