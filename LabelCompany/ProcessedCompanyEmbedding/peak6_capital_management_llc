peak — redefining what it means to be an investment firm peak the peak difference located in the historic chicago board of trade building peak is redefining what it means to be an investment firm we’re driven to see solutions others don’t—and capitalize on opportunities others miss we operate with a focused entrepreneurial drive and push ourselves to think differently this ambitious visionary approach has helped us become the diverse range of successful businesses we are today which include investments and businesses across a range of industries the foundation of our business peak capital management llc is a proprietary trading business with a year track record of success that provides significant liquidity throughout us financial markets acquired in  apex clearing corporation is a leading provider of clearing and execution solutions to the financial services industry visit apexclearingcom from sports teams to consumer goods to innovative online properties peak investments looks for opportunities where we can successfully provide operational help or capital investment to bring ideas to life founded on a great idea peak investments lp was created from the same ambitious entrepreneurial culture that thrives in the firm today cofounders matt hulsizer and jenny just started their careers at o’connor and associates — a chicagobased options trading firm with a particular specialty and emphasis on financial derivatives in  the firm was acquired by swiss bank corporation after the acquisition swiss bank decided to head in a new direction entrepreneurs at heart matt and jenny wanted to bring a different vision to life and decided to launch their own firm and in  peak investments was launched peak investments became one of the first firms to develop sophisticated proprietary technology which more efficiently manages risk in the options market this disciplined focus on risk management and technology has helped us achieve significant success in managing risk and making markets from this singular focus the firm continued to innovate growing peak into a diverse group of thriving successful businesses that now span many areas of the financial services sector  in  peak launched two new businesses looking to reach an entirely different set of investors peak launched optionshouse — an online consumer retail brokerage that delivered an exceptional combination of value and technology for active options traders peak also launched peak advisors llc — an secregistered investment adviser  then in  peak expanded its operational expertise into the clearing business with an investment into apex clearing corporation by combining decades of experience in clearing and execution with peak’s innovative approach to risk management and sophisticated technology solutions apex established itself as a leading provider of clearing and execution solutions to the financial services industry  after building optionshouse into a thriving online brokerage peak sold optionshouse to general atlantic a wellestablished global growth investor also this year after growing peak advisors’ assets under management to over  billion peak sold its stake in advisors to joe scoby former ceo of peak advisors today today peak remains anything but your typical investment firm every day our culture motivates us to seek out and invest in good ideas that have the potential of becoming great businesses we’re always looking for ways to deliver untapped exceptional value to the market why the name “peak” not surprisingly the story behind the peak name began in the mountains matt was in breckenridge colorado and inspiration struck he recalled someone once telling him it takes  peaks to make a mountain range he was drawn to this notion of peaks and how they can stand alone andor work together to form something even more powerful this perfectly represented the vision for the new firm and with that the peak name took hold interestingly the peak that matt used as inspiration for our name so many years ago opened to the public in  they named it peak and no — we had nothing to do with it it’s just fate working its magic peak capital management llc  chicago  il
