into textile industry jun    et from glyeco inc phoenix june   prnewswire  sustainable glycol technologies leader glyeco inc otcqb glye glyeco or the company has completed initial plant upgrades at its south carolina plant and successfully processed and sold several thousand gallons of waste glycol sourced from the textile industry the worldwide textile industry is the largest consumer of monoethylene glycol with demand exceeding  billion gallons annually glycols are used to create polyester fiber chips the base material in plastic food and beverage containers as well as polyester fabrics carpets and upholstery weve made tremendous progress on our plant upgrades i am very proud of what we have accomplished as a team but i am even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead driven by customer needs in underserved markets said john lorenz chairman and ceo of glyeco we are well positioned to offer a real solution designed to help our customers create more environmentally friendly products all while protecting their businesses from the threat of damage caused by improper waste glycol disposal mr lorenz continued the waste glycol created by polyester manufacturing is difficult to clean most glycol recycling methods cannot remove all of the potentially deadly pollutants while more effective processes dont make economic sense as a result textile manufacturers have very limited options for disposal and at best this material ends up in a landfill we intend to change that about glyeco glyeco is a green chemistry company with a patentpending technology for transforming a hazardous waste into green products glyeco technology™ has the unique ability to clean the polluted glycols from all five wasteproducing industries  hvac textiles automotive airline and medical  this technology recycles waste glycol to meet astm type  specifications – the same level of purity expected of refinerygrade glycols this patentpending technology enables our clients to handle the removal of their waste glycol in a responsible and environmentally safe manner  our clients can treat glycols as a more sustainable resource recycling and reusing waste glycols repeatedly since most polluted glycol is disposed of in our surface waters  which can have devastating results for the environment especially aquatic life  the glyeco technology™ solution gives our customers a way to reduce waste while caring for the environment while reducing their costs  for more information about glyeco visit httpwwwglyecocom about glycol recycling recycling waste glycols presents an inventive solution to supply shortages and increasing costs for refineryproduced material global consumption for refineryproduced ethylene glycol is over  billion gallons per year and climbing glyeco technology™ is uniquely able to process all five sources of waste glycols opening new avenues of supply with proper handling glycols can be recycled and reused

superior quality glycol products through a fullyintegrated solutions platform we are dedicated to providing solutions not just products consistent timely and customized service environmentally safe handling of waste product and technology education and technical performance support company details po box   rock hill  sc  usa more office locations – locations served business type manufacturer industry type waste and recycling market focus nationally across the country year founded  employees  about us the number of recyclers that can produce glycol pure enough to meet astm type  standards can be counted on one hand the number of recyclers who do it across as many industries and regions as we do however can be counted on one finger glyeco stands alone we are the largest most versatile and most advanced glycol recycler in the world and we’re working tirelessly to stay at the forefront of our industry so that we can make as big an impact on environmental conservation as possible breakthrough technologythe vast majority of glycol recyclers can only take used antifreeze glycols and restore them to astm type  standards so that they can only be used again as antifreeze in contrast we are able to recycle spent and contaminated glycols from a variety of industries including automotive hvac textiles aeronautics and health care and we can produce glycols pure enough to be considered equivalent to newly made glycols the old limits no longer apply unprecedented qualitymeeting type  standards using almost any source glycol is only the beginning the glyeco comprehensive quality controlassurance qca program ensures that we consistently produce an impressive highquality recycled glycol in a costeffective manner the qca program includes independent lab testing for compliance with astm standards documented compliance with the epa hazardous waste manifest system as well as all state and local regulations and other policies and practices that ensure that we reliably meet or exceed our goals expanding footprintglyeco is the only multipleregion recycler in the world with five strategically placed locations across the united states we are the only multiregion recycler in the world and we are growing the company is bringing on more recycling plants this year to serve our existing clients and offer recycling services to additional industries unique intelligenceour chief technology officer has over  years of experience in the glycol industry and is a former head of the astms coolant division rounding out our management team are senior chemical engineers and plant managers who are some of the most sophisticated antifreeze recycling experts in the world our team is ready to tackle the industry’s thorniest problems head on why recycle glycols the epa lists glycol as a hazardous waste and estimates only  of used antifreeze is recycled statistics for other industries are not reported and the vast majority of waste glycol is disposed of without documentation  very likely in a way that damages our environment glyeco techology® transforms this hazardous waste into viable green products with this patentpending technology most of this hazardous waste can be cleaned and reused again and again recycling waste glycol conserves a costly limited resource and is safer for the environment glycol is a hazardous waste which ranks  on the national pollutant inventory substance profile during use glycols become contaminated with dirt metals and oils which increase their toxicity and can contaminate soils and natural water glycols break down in water over a few days to a couple weeks because of this rapid biodegradability the epa allows disposal by release to surface waters however when glycols break down in water they deplete oxygen levels which kills fish and other aquatic life the immediate effect of exposure to ethylene glycol can mean death for humans animals birds fish  plants protects children animals fish and plants we think recycling can mitigate potential liability as well as reduce costs and boost public image some of the contaminents found in used glycols such as cadmium and lead are considered very dangerous for our environment the national waste minimization program has included these contaminents in their  priority chemicals targeted to be eliminated from our industrial waste glyeco technology™ effectively removes these contaminents from all five industrial glycol waste streams and allows for their proper disposal more about glyeco inc glyeco technology for many years the only glycols recycled in any meaningful amount were antifreeze glycols the rest of the world’s glycol waste was simply dumped into the ground or into a body of water now with our patentpending process we are able to recycle glycols from a wide variety of industries including automotive hvac aeronautics textiles and health care and after years of research and development our products are purer than ever before meeting astm type  standards reliably and costeffectively that is our glycols can be put to any use that newly produced glycol can be put to and we have a process for recycling almost  of the world’s glycol waste our inventive technology removes challenging pollutants including esters organic acids high dissolved solids and high undissolved solids our technology has the added benefit of deftly clearing oilhydrocarbons additives and dyes which are typically found in used engine coolants a rigorous quality assurance and control program which includes independent lab testing ensures
