raised wright initially styled michelle obama for an essence magazine shoot when she was the wife of thensen barack obama that editorial shoot when wright knew little about the senator or his wife turned into a blossoming relationship between the future first lady and stylist“to be honest i wasn’t too optimistic i wasn’t thinking ‘oh they’re going to be the first family’ i was just doing a job” wright says who went on to style michelle obama for a few more magazine shoots while he was moving to los angeles to work for frederic fekkai to craft redcarpetready looks for celebrity clientsadvertisement“i remember telling her ‘i’m moving to la good luck i hope you all win’” wright says matteroffactlybut then wright got the call to spend a week doing michelle obama’s hair for the

prior to him the only person who’d done her hair professionally was stylist ronnie flowers who’d done her hair since she was a childadvertisementwright realizing the gravity of the moment asked the soontobe first lady “do you mind shampooing your hair when you get ready for the night”“and she was a little reluctant because she’d just had a relaxer a couple days before” wright says “i think she knew that i wanted to put my stamp on it she agreed a little reluctantly but she agreed but i remember the next morning after the speech the speech was widely popular but everybody talked about her

day a stylist gets to make frontpage news for a hairdowright has no overarching hair philosophy “i’m not that deep” but proudly believes that hair is a language if it’s not moving it has no voice” he was inspired to do hair by his grandmother minnie brown who started doing hair at age  and continued to work as a stylist until she was  years oldadvertisementsomething of a hair child prodigy wright was told by his grandmother that he was able to put hair into “a clean ponytail” by age  by age  he started developing his own hair clientele gaining a full roster of clients by age  his father then built a salon in the basement for wright to work out of which he did until he was about advertisementwright doesn’t believe in those old schisms of “good” and “bad” hair “hair is hair it’s all beautiful” instead he believes the current move toward going natural—one even the first lady got caught up in—is one part trend one part revolution“i think a lot of women are starting to see what type of damage chemicals has caused their hair over the years and they’re really starting to embrace their curls and really embrace the fact that they can be versatile” wright says “they can wear it curly they can wear it straight they don’t have to really conform to any particular look they can do it all and that’s one thing that is going to stick that’s the revolution part of it … the revolution part will stick all about curl power”as the obamas wind down their stay in the white house wright is considering what his next moves may be he’ll definitely do television maybe a product line maybe put his name on a salon but he may also write a book “a memoir maybe a beauty book as well”advertisementbut as for his relationship with his most famous client that’s one that wright hopes will not

wearing we dished with wright and got tips for pulling off styles that are downright presidential saul loebafpgetty images  get a curly cut according to wright pulling off a curly look is all about having a cut that accentuates your natural texture some styles are made for hair only when its blownout straight you want a cut thats made for both curly and straight looks he says if youre concerned with how your hair will look wavy ask your stylist to cut it when its curly and then blow it out and fine tune when its straight ric feferbergafpgetty images  invest in the right tools when it comes to textured hair a ceramic round brush is key for keeping strands healthy and shiny no matter how much you style it says wright for finer hair wright likes a rubberbased denman brush it grips the hair a little and smooths the cuticle out he says kevin mazurwireimage  try a fakeout style im a big fan of what i call the uptuck says wright it works very well with faceframing layers which most people have you pinup all the hair in the back and then let the front fall naturally its like youve gotten a haircut you kind of fake them out a little bit and its a great way to add versatility to your look nicholas kammafpgetty images  deep conditionfrequently one upside to being constantly barraged by flashbulbs and photographers the first lady gets to show off her shiny healthy hair people always think glossy hair is topical but true luminous shine is achieved at the root says wright you should be deep conditioning to soften and nourish the hair shaft every time you shampoo there is no such thing as too much deep conditioning his favorite pick softsheencarson roots of nature reconstructing deep treatment which strengthens hair with a blend of shea butter and green tea olivier doulieryabaca  give your hair a day off even women with the healthiest hair need to minimize how often they style says wright a general rule of thumb if your hair is heavily styled and loaded with product four times a week keep it down on the fifth day that one day will give your cuticles a chance to flatten and rebond to the hair shaft resulting in stronger shinier looks when you return to styling olivier douliery abaca  rediscover the ponytail call wright oldfashioned but the ponytail is one of his favorite looks ive always been a huge fan it highlights the beauty of a womans face he says and no the ponytail is not just for the gym a ponytail can honestly be taken from day to night if its done properly says wright in the morning make sure its smooth and has a nice curve to it for the cocktail party simply wrap a strand around the elastic and youve got an elegant look or dress up the entire style by parting your hair on the side before gathering it at the base of your neck nicholas kammafpgetty images  protect your hair from overstyling flatirons daily blowouts curling ironsmost women cant make it through the day without at least one heated styling tool wright sees nothing wrong with that as long as you use the right reinforcements be sure youre using protective guards on your hair thermal protecting sprays create a barrier on the hair shaft and keep the heat from penetrating into that inner core which is what causes permanent damage he says olivier douliery abaca  choose the right elastic shhwrights got a little secret and its nothing fancy i carry a range of goody colored elastics in my kit he says i always make sure that the band matches the hair color of the person im working with its an easy way to make a style look elegant the stylist also prefers matching hair pins too lise aserudafpgetty images   i like updos that look very simple and natural wright said people try to make their hair a little too perfect with updos and thats where it

hair stylist johnny wright talks natural hair styleblazer exclusive michelle styleblazer exclusive michelle obama’s hairstylist johnny wright talks natural hair and the ‘bangs heard round the world’ february   by crystal tate previousnexteven if you are unfamiliar with celebrity hairstylist johnny wright you are certainly familiar with his most famous client michelle obama wright began exclusively styling the first lady’s hair right after president barack obama took office and the rest is history we recently chatted with the softsheencarson spokesperson to find out how he got his start his thoughts on the natural hair phenomenon and who he thinks has the best hair besides flotus of course keep reading to see what he had to share styleblazer we hear you’ve been styling hair since you were a teenager what made you initially want to enter the hair industry johnny wright my grandmother my grandmother started doing hair when she was  years old and she was doing hair until she was  years old and she passed at  so i was pulled under her wing she was doing hair at the house and had salons she had a client that was coming to her before my mother was born so she’s had clients for over  years she was taught under madam c j walker she inspired what i’m doing today and the majority of the reason why i love the industry so much is because of my grandmother minnie brown i started out in chicago when i was  years old and then moved to la in  sb were you already doing michelle obama’s hair in chicago or did you meet her after jw she had a hairstylist she was going to since she was  and his name is ronnie flowers so he was the one who was her hairstylist but i was supposed to do her several times throughout the year for different reasons initially i did her hair for an essence magazine photo shoot this was during the campaign right when they first announced they were running two months later i did it for o magazine and you would see articles inside about her because of her being a senator’s wife and at that time i had moved to los angeles we continued the relationship because she was in los angeles pretty often with the campaign when she was in town she called me so she could be camera ready it all really changed for the  democratic national convention it was in denver but i was in los angeles and i don’t think ronnie was available for the whole week so they called and asked me to be with her in denver the night of her speech was the first time i did her hair from start to finish prior to that i would only keep her camera ready her hair was always shampooed it was always dried and it already had a cut but i was just keeping her camera ready and keeping her fresh for the camera but that night i did her hair from start to finish and then the next morning everybody was talking about her hair sb that is such a cool story and that was the night of the democratic national convention jw yes of course her speech was powerful i don’t want to take away from that at all but at the same time people did notice a shift in her hair i called it a different stroke of the brush sb that’s an amazing and inspiring story so since then you have been her main stylist jw i didn’t actually become her main stylist until president obama took office not too far after they won the election i got a call from her staff that i should come down to her for a vogue shoot in dc i was in la at the time so i ended up doing it and at that shoot that’s when she asked me would i be willing to work with her full time and that was january  sb nice so michelle obama’s hair makes headlines every year in  it was all about the bangs what has been her favorite hairstyle so far jw i can’t answer that question that’s personal sb ok moving on  was all about the bangs people across america were taking her picture to their hairstylists to recreate the look jw yeah i know it was crazy sb it was crazy i really think the bangs was the hairstyle heard around the world jw i always tell people it was the bang heard ’round the world sb exactly it literally was i love that so she retired the bangs what can we expect from her for  jw i don’t know laughs i never ask and i never answer any of those questions because those are all personal to the first lady all of those type of things would have to be a surprise i have no idea we don’t plan things out that’s just not the process even the bangs it was like a thing that we just did and we didn’t know there was going to be such an impact sb right now i feel like natural hair has become the premiere thing as far as hair is concerned what do you think of the natural hair movement is it here to stay or is it a fad jw i think it’s amazing and i hope it’s here to stay i mean you never know if it’s just a fad the thing about it is new products are being developed every year and people like to try things out with their hair and if there’s an amazing product that straightens the hair and it’s not damaging and has no chemicals then that may become a trend too what i think about natural hair i think it’s awesome i mean the thing that curly nikki is doing and the blog rock yo rizos is great it’s something people are really starting to embrace and what i think is so great about it is you’re able to have that versatility you can wear your hair straight sometimes you can wear your hair curly sometimes but you can only get the curly aspect if your hair is natural i think that’s what’s so good about it i think products sell more companies developing products that are for natural hair…like with me i’ve been working with softsheencarson for the past  years we have a new product line called au naturale which is amazing for those women who are trying to adapt and understand their natural hair texture and highly textured hair and we have products that are helping them keep their hair moisturized because people don’t understand that natural hair can be very dry if it isn’t conditioned and treated properly with the right products so that’s what au naturale is all about it’s all about versatility and women use their hair as an accessory and to be able to change it up just as much as they change their jewelry or their shoes i think that’s what women with natural hair are also doing the thing about it is we really have to dig deep and really try to figure out what is the issue that we have with our natural hair you know a lot of this stems from way back in the day when we were told that texture is not proper it’s not professional you need to look this way or try straight hair it’s unacceptable so i think women have just started to embrace their hair texture and embrace who they really are as a part of their movement sb i feel like natural hair products are something women are much more interested in as of lately can you share tips on using the right hair care products jw there are products out there that are made like au naturale for natural hair care i think that’s the best option because it’s going to keep the natural texture in mind i think as long as the product is moisturizing and conditioning your highly textured hair that’s what’s most important a lot of times those natural hair care products will cater to ingredients that will keep that curl moisturized you want to lengthen the curls that are there but still maintain the shape or help define the curls and natural hair care products are going to do that they’re the best choice for natural hair care sb what about styling tools what are the do’s and don’ts jw the only tool that i use is corioliss it’s a product that i’ve been using for the past five years now and the reason i love this tool so much is because the plates are made of titanium and the titanium plates are much gentler on the hair first it’s really because of the temperature control you have with this iron most flat irons or curling irons can either be turned on or off when you do straighten your hair you don’t want to have the temperature on the highest level offered you want to bring it down a little bit just enough to get it straight but not to the point where it’s damaging your hair what people don’t understand is heat does the same thing to your hair that chemicals do to your hair but it’s over time so if you constantly keep styling your hair and if you keep using the highest temperature that that iron offers you are going to be straightening the hair out and you’ll lose your curl pattern sb what’s the benchmark jw i think you should start as low as possible and see if you’re able to get your hair straight with that if not gradually go up and see if you can get your hair straight you should never have to get to  degrees which is too high sb that makes sense so we’re in a new year and spring will be here before we know it what do you predict will be the big hair trends for  jw one thing i am noticing is that a lot of women are going darker for spring this year normally they tend to go lighter but they’re going darker think warm reds and deeper blondes so that’s one of the trends and people don’t want their hair perfectly coifed they want approachable hair that is definitely in now not too structured not too perfectly combed just a little tousled just kind of like you did it yourself even with natural hair texture wearing it big and curly afros are definitely coming back in a different way you see a lot of highly textured hair and a lot of curly hair highly textured hair that’s styled and it really makes that impression it’s getting a lot of attention you’re starting to see it in the workplace now so people aren’t seeing it as unprofessional now sb i think that people love the whole big curly afro look let’s say your hair isn’t long enough to get the fro so you have to resort to adding a piece or a wig do you approve jw absolutely i love extensions and adding things to your hair to change up your hairstyle another thing you can do are straw sets they give you that texture they make your hair thicker and they last a long time it takes a while to actually do one so once it’s done you’re going to be happy and it’s going to last a long time i do think if it’s a wig it’s all fun what’s wrong with sewins and some highly textured hair you could rock an afro for a couple of weeks and then you can take it out and you’re back to yourself there is nothing wrong with that sb besides michelle if you had to pick one person who has the best hair who would you choose jw  i can’t say best hair because that’s wrong everyone’s hair is good sb ok best hairstyle jw there’s nobody who’s my favorite right now honestly sb best hair color or best hair cut jw i’m loving tamron hall from the “today” show i love those short hair cuts i also love anything that rihanna does she’s a trendsetter with anything she does sb is there anything you have coming up for  that we should be on the look out for jw always be on the look out for stuff from me i always have my hands and feet into something there will be a lot of surprises coming from me in  previousnext lol  he called natural hair a fad because he sewed a few tracks in the flotus’ hair i’m from chicago and i remember the before her hair is thick but weak the old stylist tried to do her natural hair and this guy gave her a weave the bangs were a full sewin weave with a bang she had the same weave as nikki minaj but styled professionally and cut at the shoulder she’s a nice lady and all this is nothing against michelle lavergne but a weave is a weave that’s a classic chicago weave gn i so appreciate everything which all members of the first lady’s style and design team do to create such beautiful image of a black woman on an international stage two thumbs up to them all and this guy sounds superclassy and professional great job all around dageneralpatton♑ and her new hair color is beautiful bravo to flotus glam team kyle wasting our tax dollars on a pig tina lynn go f yourself or either

asked me to run his shop for the  weeks as a favor it was a great  weeks the shop had record setting sales and i had the best  weeks working after he came back he asked me to stay on and worki ended up working my way up to managing the shop and then became a part owner after  years there i moved back to texas and worked retail at a cigar shop on the north side of houston and ran the shop in the evenings i had gone to ipcpr in  and was asked to work as a consultant for a brand new shop in alpharetta georgia that was in need of some help getting started it was a temporary assignment but the money was too good to pass up i left houston and went to georgia for a few months i handled all the marketing for the shop as well as worked in the shop i trained the staff  ordered product and built a great events calendar through my contacts in the business after my assignment ended i came back to texas without a jobso repping cigars was the next move and a natural fit i started representing one company and quickly discovered that repping independently was not going to pay the bills unless i added more lines my business as an independent cigar broker has taken off and i havent looked back since how many different brands are you a representative for i represent  boutique cigar brands and also rep a national accessories line which i rep along side of my cigars as it goes hand in hand does being a representative require you hold any type of certifications if sohow long did ago you get certified and how important is your certification to what you do i do not have any certifications just  years of solid hands on experience as a rep when introducing your brand to a potential shop what are some of the things that you look for in that shop i look for what my shop owner needs to meet the demands and needs of his clientele and make all my lines available to all the shops i work with how long have you smoked cigars i started smoking cigars when i started working retail in a cigar shop over  years ago what is your favorite type of cigar and why i have evolved thru the years i enjoy a wide variety of blends but i have really come to love mediumfull body cigars and have a lot of favorites how do you rate the houston cigar scene and lounges versus other areas houston is in my opinion a cigar smokers mecca and in houston we have so many educated and experienced smokers i see a lot of the true smokers at certain shops but a lot of them travel around and frequent multiple shops in the area the lounges in houston are wonderful and there are so many great ones in houston to choose from i think the shops in other areas are great too but the seats in the lounges are not filled up like they are here in htown what tips or advice do you have for new smokers i would recommend starting off mild and non flavored go with a connecticut wrapper for the most part and let your local retailer guide you as you build your palette keeping track of what you like and making notes is also a good idea names bands and cigars look all alike to a rookie and if you had a cigar that you like its good to be able to walk in to the cigar shop knowing what it was that worked for you it will help the staff in making suggestions for other brands if you can identify what you have smoked and liked a lot are there any new or boutique cigars that you recommend of course i am all about boutique brands i would suggest my brands to start they are  valeroso sosa cigars la hoja and felix assouline another great cigar thats just come out on the scene is cabal cigars how do you feel about cigar ratings and does the rating influence your choices in what you smoke ratings are a blessing and a great way to promote a brand i personally do not rely on them because i like to try smokes based on what people personally recommend what is your favorite drink and cigar pairing and why i like vanilla coke with maduro wrappers and drink bourbon with any cigars are there any must have products that you recommend a quality cutter and lighter is essential what is next for you in the cigar world to continue to build my brands in texas and expand to eventually have reps that work with me as my portfolio of brands continues to grow eventually i will look to blend and make my own line if you could only smoke one cigar what would it be and why it would be a brazilian wrapper i could smoke the  original blend every single day for the rest of my life follow michelle aka that cigar girl on twitter malleyfan go back otlmagazine  for the lovers of the leaf  infootlmagazinecom  š otl magazine and
