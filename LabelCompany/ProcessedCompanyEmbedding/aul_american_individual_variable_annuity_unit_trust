may do so through the dollar cost averaging dca program the theory of dollar cost averaging is that greater numbers of accumulation units are purchased at times when the unit prices are relatively low than are purchased when the prices are higher this has the effect when purchases are made at different prices of reducing the aggregate average cost per accumulation unit to less than the average of the accumulation unit prices on the same purchase dates however participation in the dollar cost averaging program does not assure a contract owner of greater profits from the purchases under the program nor will it prevent or necessarily alleviate losses in a declining market for example assume that a contract owner requests that  per month be transferred from the oneamerica money

of monthly transfers  or  the average cost per accumulation unit for these purchases is the total amount transferred  divided by the total number of accumulation units purchased  or  this table is for illustrative purposes only and is not representative of future results under a dca program the owner deposits premiums into the mmia and then authorizes aul to transfer a specific dollar amount from the mmia into one or more other investment accounts at the unit values determined on the dates of the transfers this may be done monthly quarterly semiannually or annually these transfers will continue automatically until aul receives notice to discontinue the program or until there is not enough money in the mmia to continue the program whichever occurs first currently the minimum required amount of each transfer is  although aul reserves the right to change this minimum transfer amount in the future transfers to or from the fixed account are not permitted under the dollar cost averaging program at least seven days advance written notice to aul is required before the date of the first proposed transfer under the dca program aul offers the dollar cost averaging program to contract owners at no charge and the company reserves the right to temporarily discontinue terminate or change the program at any time contract owners may change the frequency of scheduled transfers or may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled transfers or may discontinue participation in the program at any time by providing written notice to aul provided that aul must receive written notice of such a change at least five days before a previously scheduled transfer is to occur contract owners may initially elect to participate in the dca program and if this election is made at the time the contract is applied for the program will take effect on the first monthly quarterly semiannual or annual transfer date following the premium receipt by aul at its home office the contract owner may select the particular date of the month quarter or year that the transfers are to be made and such transfers will automatically be performed on such date provided that such date selected is a day that aul is open for business and provided further that such date is a valuation date if the date selected is not a business day or is not a valuation date then the transfer will be made on the next succeeding valuation date to participate in the program a minimum deposit of  is required contract owners variable account value accumulation units premiums allocated to the investment accounts available under a contract are credited to the contract in the form of accumulation units the number of accumulation units to be credited is determined by dividing the dollar amount allocated to the particular investment account by the accumulation unit value for the particular investment account as of the end of the valuation period in which the premium is credited the number of accumulation units so credited to the contract shall not be changed by a subsequent change in the value of an accumulation unit but the dollar value of an accumulation unit may vary from valuation date to valuation date depending upon the investment experience of the investment account and charges against the investment account accumulation unit value aul determines the accumulation unit value for each investment account of the variable account on each valuation date the accumulation unit value for the mmia was initially set at  and  for each of the other investment accounts subsequently on each valuation date the accumulation unit value for each investment account is determined by multiplying the net investment factor determined as of the end of the valuation date for the particular investment account by the accumulation unit value for the investment account as of the immediately preceding valuation period the accumulation unit value for each investment account may increase decrease or remain the same from valuation period to valuation period in accordance with the net investment factor net investment factor the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of an investment account from one valuation period to the next for any investment account for a valuation period the net investment factor is determined by dividing a by b and then subtracting c from the result where a is equal to  the net asset value per share of the fund in which the investment account invests determined as of the end of the valuation period plus  the per

contracts described in this prospectus are designed for use in connection with nontax qualified retirement plans for individuals and for use by individuals in connection with retirement plans under the provisions of sections  b   or a of the internal revenue code code the ultimate effect of federal income taxes on values under a contract on annuity payments and on the economic benefits to the owner the annuitant and the beneficiary or other payee may depend upon the type of qualified plan for which the contract is purchased and a number of different factors the discussion contained herein and in the statement of additional information is general in nature it is based upon auls understanding of the present federal income tax laws as currently interpreted by the internal revenue service irs and is not intended as tax advice no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of the present federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the irs future legislation may affect annuity contracts adversely moreover no attempt is made to consider any applicable state or other laws because of the inherent complexity of such laws and the fact that tax results will vary according to the terms of the qualified plan and the particular circumstances of the individual involved any person contemplating the purchase of a contract or receiving annuity payments under a contract should consult a qualified tax advisor aul does not make any guarantee regarding the tax status of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts consult your tax advisor diversification standards treasury department regulations under section h of the code prescribe asset diversification requirements which are expected to be met by the investment companies whose shares are sold to the investment accounts failure to meet these requirements would jeopardize the tax status of the contracts see the statement of additional information for additional details in connection with the issuance of the regulations governing diversification under section h of the code the treasury department announced that it would issue future regulations or rulings addressing the circumstances in which a variable contract owners control of the investments of a separate account may cause the contract owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the separate account if the variable contract owner is considered the owner of the securities underlying the separate account income and gains produced by those securities would be included currently in a contract owners gross income it is not clear at present what these regulations or rulings may provide it is possible that when the regulations or rulings are issued the contracts may need to be modified in order to remain in compliance aul intends to make reasonable efforts to comply with any such regulations or rulings so that the contracts will be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes and reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th taxation of annuities in general  nonqualified plans section  of the code governs taxation of annuities in general a contract owner is not taxed on increases in value under an annuity contract until some form of distribution is made under the contract however the increase in value may be subject to tax currently under certain circumstances see contracts owned by nonnatural persons and diversification standards  surrenders or withdrawals prior to the annuity date code section  provides that amounts received upon a surrender or withdrawal from a contract prior to the annuity date generally will be treated as gross income to the extent that the cash value of the contract determined without regard to any surrender charge in the case of a withdrawal or surrender exceeds the investment in the contract in general the investment in the contract is that portion if any of premiums paid under a contract less any distributions received previously under the contract that are excluded from the recipients gross income the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for purposes of this rule a pledge or assignment of a contract is treated as a payment received on account of a withdrawal from a contract similarly loans under a contract generally are treated as distributions under the contract  surrenders or withdrawals on or after the annuity date upon receipt of a lumpsum payment the recipient is taxed if the cash value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract  amounts received as an annuity for amounts received as an annuity the taxable portion of each payment is determined by using a formula known as the exclusion ratio which establishes the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount of annuity payments for the term of the contract that ratio is then applied to each payment to determine the nontaxable portion of the payment that remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income rates once the excludible portion of annuity payments to date equals the investment in the contract the balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable withholding of federal income taxes on all distributions may be required unless a recipient who is eligible elects not to have any amounts withheld and properly notifies aul of that election special rules apply to withholding on distributions from employee benefit plans and b arrangements  penalty tax on certain surrenders and withdrawals with respect to amounts withdrawn or distributed before the recipient reaches age   a penalty tax is imposed equal to  of the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income however the penalty tax is not applicable to withdrawals  made on or after the death of the owner or where the owner is not an individual the death of the primary annuitant who is defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary importance in affecting the timing and amount of the payout under the contract  attributable to the recipients becoming totally disabled within the meaning of code section m or  which are part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the recipient or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the recipient and his beneficiary the  penalty also does not apply in certain other circumstances described in code section  if the penalty tax does not apply to a surrender or withdrawal as a result of the application of item  above and the series of payments are subsequently modified other than by reason of death or disability the tax for the first year in which the modification occurs will be increased by an amount determined in accordance with irs regulations equal to the tax that would have been imposed but for item  above plus interest for the deferral period if the modification takes place a before the close of the period which is five years from the date of the first payment and after the recipient attains age   or b before the recipient reaches age   additional considerations  distributionatdeath rules in order to be treated as an annuity contract a contract must provide the following two distribution rules a if the owner dies on or after the annuity commencement date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining interest must be distributed at least as quickly as the method in effect on the owners death and b if the owner dies before the annuity date the entire interest in the contract must generally be distributed within five years after the date of death or if payable to a designated beneficiary must be distributed over the life of that designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary commencing within one year after the date of death of the owner if the designated beneficiary is the spouse of the owner the contract may be continued in the name of the spouse as owner for purposes of determining the timing of distributions under the foregoing rules where the owner is not an individual the primary annuitant is considered the owner in that case a change in the primary annuitant will be treated as the death of the owner finally in the case of joint owners the distributionatdeath rules will be applied by treating the death of the first owner as the one to be taken into account in determining how generally distributions must commence unless the sole surviving owner is the deceased owners spouse the endorsement that allows for joint ownership applies to spouses only  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  gift of annuity contracts generally gifts of contracts not purchased in connection with a qualified plan before the annuity commencement date will trigger income tax on the gain on the contract with the donee getting a steppedup basis for the amount included in the donors income this provision does not apply to certain transfers incident to a divorce the  penalty tax on preage   withdrawals and distributions and gift tax also may be applicable  contracts owned by nonnatural persons if the contract is held by a nonnatural person for example a corporation in connection with its nontax qualified deferred compensation plan the income on that contract generally the account value less the premium payments is includible in taxable income each year other taxes such as the alternative minimum tax and the environmental tax imposed under code section a may also apply the rule does not apply where the contract is acquired by the estate of a decedent where the contract is held by certain types of retirement plans where the contract is a qualified funding asset for structured settlements where the contract is purchased on behalf of an employee upon termination of an employee benefit plan and in the case of a socalled immediate annuity code section  deferred compensation plans for employees of state and local governments and taxexempt organizations are not within the purview of the exceptions however the income of state and local governments and taxexempt organizations generally is exempt from federal income tax  multiple contract rule for purposes of determining the amount of any distribution under code section e amounts not received as annuities that is includable in gross income all annuity contracts issued by the same insurer to the same contract owner during any calendar year must be aggregated and treated as one contract thus any amount received under any such contract prior to the contracts annuity commencement date such as a withdrawal dividend or loan will be taxable and possibly subject to the  penalty tax to the extent of the combined income in all such contracts in addition the treasury department has broad regulatory authority in applying this provision to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this new rule qualified plans the contract may be used with certain types of qualified plans as described under the contracts the tax rules applicable to participants in such qualified plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan itself no attempt is made herein to provide more than general information about the use of the contract with the various types of qualified plans contract owners annuitants and beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits under such qualified plans will be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves and may be limited by applicable law regardless of the terms and conditions of the contract issued in connection therewith for example aul may accept beneficiary designations and payment instructions under the terms of the contract without regard
