the parties to the swap the long party to a swap has no real influence or power over the shares and therefore the company by virtue of its synthetic position a total return swap is a contract whereby one party the long party receives cash flows based on the performance of an underlying asset from the other the short party a total return swap allows a party for a fee to replicate ownership of an asset without actually owning it in an equity total return swap the underlying asset is a specified notional amount of shares in a particular company where the equity total return swap is cash settled the long party receives from the short party periodic payments or a single payment at the maturity of the swap representing any increase in value of the relevant shares and any distributions such as dividends in return the long party pays to the short party any decrease in the value of the relevant shares and interest payments calculated with reference to an agreed interest rate on a notional amount – this effectively replicates the short party loaning to the long party the funds necessary to purchase the relevant printed copy for personal reading only not for distributiondecember  n volume  n issue  futures  derivatives law report   thomson reuters shares the effect of the contract is that the long party takes the upside of the relevant company’s valuation and also bears the risk of the downside just as if the long party owned the shares outright in equity total return swaps the short party will typically purchase the specified shares to hedge its own position under the swap but need not do so further there is usually no obligation on the long party to acquire the shares from the short party when the transaction unwinds nor does the long party usually have the ability to direct the voting of the short party in respect of those shares in some cases a short party will have a policy against voting any shares that it holds as a hedge position in the uk the financial services authority tackled the disclosure issue a few years ago by conducting a consultation and in june  publishing rules a detailed analysis of the uk rules are outside the scope of this article in summary the rules require any person that enters into a cashsettled total return swap in uk parlance a “contract for difference” that references a uklisted share to disclose its position or the combined position of its total return swap holdings and physical holdings once that position is equal to  percent of the relevant company’s total voting rights subject to permitted exclusion in the us the relevant disclosure regime is set out in the securities and exchange act of  the “exchange act” and its related rules recent litigation as well as the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform protection act  the “doddfrank act” means that at present the applicability of section d and g of the exchange act to cashsettled equity total return swaps is unclear and there is still no brightline rule to follow the doddfrank act section b of the doddfrank act amends sections d and g of the exchange act to specifically extend beneficial ownership reporting requirements to any person who becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of equity securities upon the purchase or sale of a securitybased swap as defined under securities and exchange commission’s “sec” rules section d of the exchange act requires a person who acquires directly or indirectly beneficial ownership of more than  percent of certain classes of equity securities registered under the exchange act to file within ten calendar days of such acquisition a report with the sec section d by its extension through section b of the doddfrank act could require the long party to a cashsettled equity total return swap whose swap referenced a notional amount of equity securities that when aggregated with other equity securities if any beneficially owned by the long party constitute at least  percent of the total outstanding shares of that class and assuming that the class of shares was registered with the sec to make disclosures to the sec as if it owned the shares the exchange act does not define the concept of “beneficial ownership” however the sec has promulgated rules defining a beneficial owner as someone who i possesses either voting power the power to vote or direct others to vote the security or investment power the power to dispose of or direct the disposition of the security or ii uses a contract device or any other arrangement as part of a scheme to evade reporting requirements also known as the “avoidance rule” section e of the doddfrank act adds a new section o to the exchange act which states that a person is deemed to acquire beneficial ownership of an equity security based on the purchase or sale of a securitybased swap only if the sec determines by rule and after consultation with prudential regulators and the treasury secretary that the purchase or sale of the securitybased swap provides incidents of ownership comparable to direct ownership of the underlying equity security and that it is necessary to achieve the purposes of the section that the purchase or sale of a securitybased swap or class of securitybased swap be deemed the acquisition of beneficial ownership of the equity security to date the sec has not exercised its rulemaking authority under section o instead in its june  release the “release” the sec repromulgated certain provisions of rule d without change printed copy for personal reading only not for distributionfutures  derivatives law report december  n volume  n issue    thomson reuters the release addresses concerns of the sec that absent readoption of rule d section  could be interpreted to exempt a person dealing in securitybased swaps from the reporting requirements of sections d and g and therefore allow an investor to use a securitybased swap to obtain an influential or control position in a public company without disclosure the repromulgation of the rules preserves the application of existing beneficial ownership rules to persons who purchase or sell securitybased swaps after the effective date of new section o ie july   as applied to securitybased swaps the sec has confirmed that under rule d a person is considered a beneficial owner of an equity security underlying a securitybased swap if any of the following apply • the securitybased swap provides a person directly or indirectly with exclusive or shared voting andor investment power over the underlying equity security whether or not such person has acquired the underlying equity security rule da • a person uses the securitybased swap as a means to divest or prevent the vesting of beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of sections d g or  of the exchange act rule db • the securitybased swap gives a person the right to acquire the underlying equity security within  days or holds the right with the purpose of changing or influencing control of the issuer of the underlying equity security rule dd in the release the sec expressly states that the readoption of the rules is intended only to preserve the regulatory status quo and that the sec staff is “engaged in a separate project to develop proposals to modernize reporting under sections d and g” this suggests then that although at present long parties to total return swaps seem to have escaped the disclosure obligations of the exchange act the relief may be shortlived the csx decision in july  the appeals court for the second circuit issued its opinion in the case of csx corporation v the children’s investment fund management et al the opinion was muchanticipated by the derivatives market looking for clarification or at least guidance as to whether the long party to a cashsettled equity total return swap could be deemed to be the beneficial owner of shares held by the short party for the purposes of section d no such clarification was forthcoming the case was first brought in march  by csx corporation “csx” against the children’s investment fund management uk llp “tci uk” the children’s investment fund management cayman ltd “tci cayman” and together with tci uk “tci” g fund lp “g fund” g capital partners lp “g lp” and g capital partners ltd together with g fund and g lp “g” and g together with tci the “funds” the circumstances of the case are as follows tci and g both hedge funds accumulated positions both by direct cash investments and through total return swaps in csx and later sought to elect a minority of candidates to the board of csx at csx’s annual shareholders’ meeting in early  csx filed suit against the funds claiming that the funds had failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of section d of the exchange act and seeking an injunction against the funds barring them from future violations of section d and preventing them from voting their shares at the csx annual shareholders’ meeting the district court held that the funds had violated section d and granted an injunction against future violations but did not enjoin the funds from voting the csx shares unsurprisingly appeals and crossappeals followed the general basis of csx’s claim was that tci breached section d because it failed to disclose its beneficial ownership of the csx shares held by its counterparty the short party to the swap transaction that were referenced in cashsettled equity total return swaps and that g and tci together violated section d by failing to disclose the formation of a group csx argued that the total return swaps referencing csx shares printed copy for personal reading only not for distributiondecember  n volume  n issue  futures  derivatives law report   thomson reuters vested beneficial ownership in the funds of the csx shares held by the bank counterparties and therefore triggered disclosure obligations under section d on the part of the funds the opinion issued by the district court in june  held that tci violated its disclosure obligations under the exchange act this holding was of concern to the swaps market in its opinion the district court deemed tci to be the beneficial owner of all csx shares held by its total return swap counterparties in determining whether tci was the beneficial owner of the csx shares held by the various bank counterparties the district court considered rule da whether tci had investment or voting power and rule db whether tci engaged in avoidance of disclosure obligations ultimately the district court decided the issue on the grounds of avoidance under rule db and deemed tci to be the beneficial owner of the relevant shares because tci had created and used the swaps with the purpose and effect of preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership as part of a scheme or plan to evade the applicable reporting requirements the district court focused on tci’s history of spreading the swaps around so that no one bank counterparty maintained positions of  percent or more and tci’s practice of transferring the swaps to banks that tci believed were favorably disposed to its voting preferences as noted above the district court’s decision was based on rule db and specific facts that tended to show that tci had tried to avoid the disclosure regime importantly the district court did not base its decision on rule da and therefore did not rule on whether owning a long position in a swap necessarily vests beneficial ownership leaving the issue open for future determination and therefore creating uncertainty in the swaps market no wonder the decision of the court of appeal was eagerly awaited unfortunately the court of appeal chose not to determine when a party to a cashsettled equity total return swap must comply with the disclosure requirements of section d citing disagreement within the panel the court of appeal instead chose to consider only whether a group violation of rule d had occurred with respect to the csx shares held outright by the funds in its judgment the higher court remanded the issue of group violation to the district court citing the need for specific evidence of whether a group existed for purposes of the csx shares that were held outright by the funds the court of appeal held that because the district court’s finding that a group violation had occurred was based upon the combination of shares held outright by the funds and those shares that the district court deemed the funds to beneficially own further review was required to assess whether a group violation had occurred only with respect to shares held outright by the funds the majority decision of the higher court did not focus on the beneficial ownership issue at all judge lewis kaplan in the court’s majority opinion explained that ultimately it was unnecessary to explore the issue of beneficial ownership as the case was decided on the basis of whether a group had formed within the meaning of section d the opinion of the court of appeal therefore gave no clear answer as to the question of beneficial ownership by long parties to a total return swap perhaps of more interest to the derivatives market are the comments of judge ralph k winter in his concurring opinion while the concurring opinion is not binding judge winter’s opinion specifically addresses the question of beneficial ownership and provides a wellreasoned analysis as to the circumstances in which a long party to an equity total return swap could be treated as the beneficial owner of the short party’s shares in his concurring opinion judge winter analyzed each of the relevant parts of rule d and effectively refuted the arguments put forward by the district court on the issue of beneficial ownership rule d addresses the issue of a person obtaining control or influence over the issuer of equity securities investment power – rule da csx argued that tci had investment power over the csx shares owned by its counterparties because tci knew that those counterparties would purchase csx shares to hedge their short positions and would then sell such shares once printed copy for personal reading only not for distributionfutures  derivatives law report december  n volume  n issue    thomson reuters the swap transaction matured in judge winter’s view simply knowing or expecting that a person may purchase or sell shares is insufficient to attribute investment power to another a counterparty can choose to hedge all some or none of its short position and may do so by purchasing shares entering into hedges or both therefore judge winter reasoned that in the absence of some other agreement governing disposition of the shares simply having a long position does not constitute having investment power either directly or indirectly voting power – rule da as noted above there is no evidence that tci’s counterparties agreed to vote their csx shares in accordance with the instructions of tci nor was this suggested at the original hearing csx argued that tci selected its swap counterparties on the basis of which way tci believed those counterparties would vote their shares judge winter opined that voting power requires more than a belief or expectation that a party will vote in a certain way or the selection of a counterparty that is more inclined to vote in a manner favorable to the long party’s interests even if coupled with evidence that the counterparty was chosen because it is viewed as holding sympathetic voting objectives holding such views is not the same as having the ability to control voting in reaching his conclusions as regards rule da judge winter focused particularly on the language of the exchange act and current sec rules judge winter pointed out that the language of the exchange act does not require disclosure of the intent to obtain control or an equity position of influence but instead requires precise action in judge winter’s view the doctrine of harmonization of interpretation required him to look to interpretations of and case law related to section  of the exchange act in interpreting section d as both rely fundamentally on the concept of beneficial ownership judge winter’s opinion focused on the fact that in  the sec harmonized section ’s interpretation of beneficial ownership with the corresponding provision of section d and concluded that such case law should be used to interpret section d in so interpreting judge winter found a largely mechanical interpretation that does not focus on the “intent” of the actors avoidance rule – rule db judge winter acknowledged that one purpose of total return swaps could be to avoid disclosure however he argued that a desire to avoid disclosure is not in and of itself sufficient to be caught by rule db such desire must be coupled with the prevention of the vesting of beneficial ownership and that such evasion is not present where the swap provides no means of control sec regulatory authority in concluding judge winter noted that in  congress stated that the sec had no authority to regulate securitybased swaps but that with the passing of the doddfrank act the sec now holds such authority the doddfrank act came into force after the district court’s  decision judge winter noted that the repromulgation of rule d by the sec addressed sec concerns that it previously had no authority to regulate securitybased swaps and that without repromulgation rule d would not apply unless the sec exercised its authority under section o of the doddfrank act judge winter argues therefore that the district court had no legal basis for deciding that section d applied to the total return swaps as the sec had no power at that time to regulate such instruments it remains to be seen whether and how the sec will finally clarify the issue by promulgating rules under its section  powers or whether the district court will revisit this issue when it reviews certain aspects of the case on remand there remains as much uncertainty in the market regarding beneficial ownership issues around cashsettled equity total return swaps as existed both prior to the csx case and the enactment of the doddfrank act while it is clear that physically settled total return swaps trigger beneficial ownership in the underlying shares on the part of the long party there is no brightline rule as regards cashsettled total return swaps what is printed copy for personal reading only not for distributiondecember  n volume  n issue  futures  derivatives law report   thomson reuters clear is that until the sec exercises its authority under doddfrank whether beneficial ownership attaches with respect to cashsettled equity total return swaps will be highly factspecific holding the right to direct the voting of the underlying shares or to acquire such shares will tend to show that beneficial ownership exists on the other hand a specific provision in any documentation that specifically renounces all voting rights would tend to suggest the opposite for now long parties should exercise caution in exercising any sort of control over the underlying shares held by their counterparty notes  ian cuillerier is a partner and claire hall is an associate in the derivatives practice of white  case ian is based in the new york office and claire is based in the los angeles office  alternatively the short party may hedge by entering into an offsetting total return swap or use a combination of the two approaches assuming the short party desires to hedge some or all of its position  n ote that physically settled equity total return swaps were and continue to be covered by the uk disclosure regime and therefore a counterparty to a physically settled equity total return swap has disclosure obligations  the uk requirements can be found in chapter  of the uk disclosure and transparency rules  the definition of securitybased swap was added to the exchange act by section a of the doddfrank act and is defined as a swap on a narrowbased security index a single security loan or interest in a loan or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event relating to a single security or narrowbased security index that directly affects the financial statements condition or obligations of the issuer section d of the dodd frank act requires the sec together with the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” to jointly further define certain terms including the term “securitybased swap” the sec and cftc have published several notices of proposed rulemaking relating to such defined terms although final definitions have not yet been published as drafted the currently proposed definition of securitybased swap would include a cashsettled equity total return swap  rule da  rule db  see beneficial ownership reporting requirements and securitybased swaps release no   fr  and beneficial ownership reporting requirements and securitybased swaps release no –  fr   the rule d standards are applied on a casebycase basis to determine whether a person is or becomes a beneficial owner a physically settled trade or a cashsettled trade that specifically allows a long party to direct voting could be caught by the disclosure requirements and legal advice should be sought in each case  as noted above the long party typically has no voting rights over the underlying shares and the short party may not actually own the referenced shares  from october  tci entered into total return swaps relating to approximately  percent of the outstanding common stock of csx and over that time also accumulated a physical stake of about  percent separately g built a combined physical and synthetic position in csx of just less than  percent  csx corp v the children’s investment fund management uk llp et al  f supp d  sdny june    a concurring opinion is one that agrees with the decision of the court but sets out a judge’s personal view of certain aspects of the decision and such judge’s reasoning in reaching the decision the majority opinion is binding law however although a concurring opinion does not carry the same precedential weight as a majority opinion it may be cited in future cases as guidance to the court  it was accepted in the case that short counterparties generally do purchase the underlying shares as a means of hedging their short positions  s ection  of the exchange act requires disclosure by certain company insiders that are beneficial owners of  percent of a company’s shares  by way of the commodity futures modernization act of  the “
