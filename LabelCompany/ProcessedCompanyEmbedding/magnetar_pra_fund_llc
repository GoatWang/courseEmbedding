market would have cooled off in late  if magnetar capital had not entered the market and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe magnetar capitals responseedit magnetar capital disputed the story many of its responses were explained in propublicas story and in a detailed letter magnetar capital sent to propublica posted on propublicas website magnetar capital said among other things that it was not betting it was hedging that most of its hedges were against nonmagnetarcapital cdos and that it was not making cdos that were built to fail on purpose it also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market that is it did not bet that mortgagebacked cdos would default it detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to propublica which are linked to on propublicas website magnetar capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprimemortgage market rather the firm states it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices the rate of mortgage defaults or the subprime mortgage market generally instead magnetar capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage its perception that the riskiest highyield tranches of cdos were underpriced relative to the lessrisky lowyield tranches the firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated with the collapse of the subprime market magnetar capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further magnetar capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail the theorycitation needed is that magnetar capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches the high prices of the highquality tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once magnetar capital was betting that in all likelihood if the equity tranch lost its value the rest of the cdo would lose value as well because many defaults were likely to happen together this is what in fact happenedcitation needed magnetar capital also disparaged the reporters stating that the questions we received from you the propublica reporters last week and the assertions reflected in those questions reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of magnetar capital’s investment strategy later magnetar capital wrote a letter to its investors rebutting many of the claims in the propublica story ie we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy at the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by propublica an online news outlet regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy that was active from  through  despite our best efforts to educate propublica’s reporters about the specifics of magnetar capital’s mortgage cdo investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of cdos propublica simply got the story wrong  despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence counter responseedit propublicas editorinchief paul steiger responded to magnetar capitals letter and wrote magnetar capital’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation cdo equity that it bet against many of those cdos or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios in particular it doesnt deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfoliosin short we see nothing in our story to correct propublica continued to publish articles on magnetar capital throughout  and  naked capitalism  econnededit yves smith of the nakedcapitalismcom along with other bloggers at that site also

came out in march  the book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable it also describes the large size of magnetar capitals play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole the book gives a larger context for the magnetar capital arbitrage fitting into smiths thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure smith and the nakedcapitalismcom bloggers continued to post articles regarding magnetar capital throughout  they also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the magnetar capital cdos similar to the

regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy that was active from  through  despite our best efforts to educate propublica’s reporters about the specifics of magnetar capital’s mortgage cdo investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of cdos propublica simply got the story wrong  despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence counter responseedit propublicas editorinchief paul steiger responded to magnetar capitals letter and wrote magnetar capital’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation cdo equity that it bet against many of those cdos or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios in particular it doesnt deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfoliosin short we see nothing in our story to correct propublica continued to publish articles on magnetar capital throughout  and  naked capitalism  econnededit yves smith of the nakedcapitalismcom along with other bloggers at that site also worked on describing and analyzing magnetar capitals cdo program smith also wrote a book econned how unenlightened self interest undermined democracy and corrupted capitalism in  which contains a detailed description of magnetar capitals activities it cites anonymous sources affiliated with institutions that did business with magnetar capital her research was gathered in october  and the book came out in march  the book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable it also describes the large size of magnetar capitals play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole the book gives a larger context for the magnetar capital arbitrage fitting into smiths thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure smith and the nakedcapitalismcom bloggers continued to post articles regarding magnetar capital throughout  they also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the magnetar capital cdos similar to the

them and then bet against the investments resulting in billions in losses for investors and ultimately making the financial crisis worse it’s a story of the perverse incentives and reckless behavior

personal message print email   update june   jp morgan chase has agreed to pay a  million penalty to settle sec charges that the bank misled investors about a complex mortgagesecurities deal during the waning days of the housing boom the sec charged that jp morgan neglected to tell investors that the hedge fund magnetar helped create the deal and was betting against it this story was the first to detail magnetars role update oct   this story has been corrected in response to a recent letter from magnetar read their letter along with our response   in late  the booming us housing market seemed to be slowing the federal reserve had begun raising interest rates subprime mortgage company shares were falling investors began to balk at buying complex mortgage securities the housing bubble which had propelled a historic growth in home prices seemed poised to deflate and if it had the great financial crisis of  which produced the great recession of  might have come sooner and been less severe at just that moment a few savvy financial engineers at a suburban chicago hedge fund helped revive the wall street money machine spawning billions of dollars of securities ultimately backed by home mortgages get propublicas top stories and major investigations delivered to your inbox when the crash came nearly all of these securities became worthless a loss of an estimated  billion paid by investors the investment banks who helped bring them into the world and eventually american taxpayers yet the hedge fund named magnetar for the supermagnetic field created by the last moments of a dying star earned outsized returns in the year the financial crisis began how magnetar pulled this off is one of the untold stories of the meltdown only a small group of wall street insiders was privy to what became known as the magnetar trade nearly all of those approached by propublica declined to talk on the record fearing their careers would be hurt if they spoke publicly but interviews with participants emails thousands of pages of documents and details about the securities that until now have not been publicly disclosed shed light on an arcane secretive corner of wall street according to bankers and others involved the magnetar trade worked this way the hedge fund bought the riskiest portion of a kind of securities known as collateralized debt obligations  cdos if housing prices kept rising this would provide a solid return for many years but thats not what hedge funds are after they want outsized gains the sooner the better and magnetar set itself up for a huge win it placed bets that portions of its own deals would fail along the way it did something to enhance the chances of that happening according to several people with direct knowledge of the deals they say magnetar pressed to include riskier assets in their cdos that would make the investments more vulnerable to failure the hedge fund acknowledges it bet against its own deals but says the majority of its short positions as they are known on wall street involved similar cdos that it did not own magnetar says it never selected the assets that went into its cdos magnetar says it was market neutral meaning it would make money whether housing rose or fell read their full statement dozens of wall street professionals including many who had direct dealings with magnetar are skeptical of that assertion they understood the magnetar trade as a bet against the subprime mortgage securities market why else they ask would a hedge fund sponsor tens of billions of dollars of new cdos at a time of rising uncertainty about housing key details of the magnetar trade remain shrouded in secrecy and the fund declined to respond to most of our questions magnetar invested in  cdos from the spring of  to the summer of  though it declined to name them propublica has identified  an independent analysis commissioned by propublica shows that these deals defaulted faster and at a higher rate compared to other similar cdos according to the analysis  percent of the magnetar deals were in default by the end of  compared with  percent for comparable cdos the study was conducted by pf securities evaluations a cdo valuation firm magnetar says defaults dont necessarily indicate the quality of the underlying cdo assets from what weve learned there was nothing illegal in what magnetar did it was playing by the rules in place at the time and the hedge fund didnt cause the housing bubble or the financial crisis but the magnetar trade does illustrate the perverse incentives and reckless behavior that characterized the last days of the boom at least nine banks helped magnetar hatch deals merrill lynch citigroup and ubs all did multiple deals with magnetar jpmorgan chase often lauded for having avoided the worst of the cdo craze actually ended up doing one of the riskiest deals with magnetar in may  nearly a year after housing prices started to decline according to marketing material and prospectuses the banks didnt disclose to cdo investors the role magnetar played many of the bankers who worked on these deals personally benefited earning millions in annual bonuses the banks booked profits at the outset but those gains were fleeting as it turned out the banks that assembled and marketed the magnetar cdos had trouble selling them and when the crash came they were among the biggest losers some bankers involved in the magnetar trade now regret what they did we showed one of the many people fired as a result of the cdo collapse a list of unusually risky mortgage bonds included in a magnetar deal he had worked on the deal was a disaster he shook his head at being reminded of the details and said after looking at this i deserved to lose my job magnetar wasnt the only market player to come up with clever ways to bet against housing many articles and books including a bestseller by michael lewis have recounted how a few investors saw trouble coming and bet big such short bets can be helpful they can serve as a counterweight to manias and keep bubbles from expanding magnetars approach had the opposite effect  by helping create investments it also bet against the hedge fund was actually fueling the market magnetar wasnt alone in that a few other hedge funds also created cdos they bet against and as the new york times has reported goldman sachs did too but magnetar industrialized the process creating more and bigger cdos several journalists have alluded to the magnetar trade in recent years but until now none has assembled a full narrative yves smith a prominent financial blogger who has reported on aspects of the magnetar trade writes in her new book econned that magnetar went into the business of creating subprime cdos on an unheard of scale if the world had been spared their cunning the insanity of  would have been less extreme and the unwinding milder next magnetar gets started follow eisingerj follow jakebernstein like this story sign up for our daily newsletter to get more of our best work print  comments janet tavakoli april    pm my  book “collateralized debt obligations  structured finance” includes the “magnetar” structure as applied to corporate cdos  i don’t know the first person to use that structure but contrary to many finance articles and recent books the “magnetar” structure itself wasn’t new when it was applied to mortgage loans and other asset backed securities  for example it wasn’t developed by any of the people in greg zuckerman’s book the greatest trade ever  furthermore there are a large variety of structured products and a huge network of players  magnetar was a cog in the wheel but the story is much bigger then just this one hedge fund one of the key people at magnetar david snyderman was in the structured products group at citadel in august   at that time the group asked me to meet with them and asked if i would help them with this structure for the abs market after reading about it in my cdo book wiley  chapter  especially pp  and this information is also in the  updated edition  they said my book gave them the idea to apply the structure to the other loan markets  as i recall snyderman did not attend his group’s meeting on that day  my cdo book was written as a caution to investors not a handbook for guys like this  i declined to get involved  in my opinion the investment banks that got involved in these structures should have declined to do so too  to the best of my knowledge citadel got rid of the entire group and they scattered to various shops the sec should have shut down this kind of activity but the sec dropped seminal investigations into cdos and failed to act on information in the public domain  the magnetar strategy story was already told by the wall street journal before bear stearns imploded march  and before fannie freddie lehman aig and tarp  this was before the meltdown when it mattered most but regulators and most of main stream media ignored the significance of these issues the following is a link to a december  wall street journal story explaining the creation and implosion of a cdo called “norma” with which magnetar was involved  it was written by serena ng and carrick mollenkamp  httponlinewsjcomarticlesbhtml the following is an excerpt of story the same reporters did for wsj on magnetar’s strategy on january   link at bottom  i am also quoted in this article  the wsj has to work within space limitations but it got the word out on many of the key issues and it did a good job there is obviously a lot more to this i wrote about many of the structures and players in structured finance wiley  and in my book on the financial crisis and how to fix it dear mr buffett wiley  a fund behind astronomical losses by serena ng and carrick mollenkamp january   the trading strategy of a littleknown hedge fund run by an astronomy buff contributed to billions in losses on wall street even as the fund itself profited from the subprimemortgage crisis its trading highlights the important role some hedge funds played in the great debt unwind that is now plaguing financial markets many hedge funds realized early on “that the loans and securities that went into cdos were extremely toxic and they designed structures to exploit that” says janet tavakoli a structuredfinance consultant

quant rob copeland date june  author lallenwhite  comments this old school hedge fund is going quant rob copeland rob copelandevanston ill—alec litowitz founder of one of the country’s largest hedge funds raised a simple question at the firm’s investment committee meeting how often do mergers fall apart no one had the answer so the magnetar capital llc founder assigned a team of analysts to pore through three decades of data to find out they calculated that while  of announced transactions eventually collapse the market behaves as if nearly twice as many do mr litowitz reasoned a computer program could make money exploiting that discovery and thousands of others so he posed a second question “what if we could take what was in our head and our database and make rules out of it” so began six years ago a billiondollar quantitative effort at magnetar designed to help the  billion firm buck a hedgefund massacre waylaying its peers and set to rest memories of controversial trading by the firm on subprime housing during the financial crisis like highend restaurants hedge funds often roll out new menus to entice investors to keep coming back and quantitative trading is the latest special du jour in the wake of years of disappointing investment performance and client defections hedge funds are emphasizing a systematized algorithmic approach to investing that is a change from the handoveryourmoneyandjusttrustus pitches of an earlier era magnetar’s quantitative push is different from many of its highspeed quant competitors who parse reams of data in the hunt for an edge—even one they can’t explain magnetar is taking a more manual approach discoveries such as the types of corporate acquirers are more likely to see through to the end of a tough deal are translated into computer algorithms algorithm set of rules that can parse data and automatically decide what to buy and sell that trade automatically“we start with intuitions and then go see if the data backs it up” says mr litowitz “most people reverse it they go looking for data and then go find a signal that explains it” the shift is particularly remarkable because magnetar and mr litowitz for years represented the prototypical headstrong hedge fund investors and industry executives say an adrenaline junkie who competes in triathlons and offroad mountain bike races yearold mr litowitz was one of kenneth griffin’s first hires at hedgefund giant citadel llc he racked up such profits that mr griffin awarded him partownership of the firm mr litowitz left to start magnetar in  the firm launched with  billion in capital marking one of the largest hedgefund launches of the time the firm commanded high fees even by the standards of the era passing on many of its costs directly to investors listen to wsj podcast magnetar capital blackrock bet on the quants since inception magnetar’s flagship fund has reported only two down years with an average annualized return of roughly  after fees similar to many hedge funds however investors have pulled more from magnetar than they have put in of late the firm still manages nearly as much assets as it ever has thanks to positive investment performance including  gains in each of the past two years for its newest quantitative vehicle investor documents show the firm was investigated by the securities and exchange commission after the crisis for its role in creating mortgage securities that suffered billions of dollars in losses in the housing swoon the firm consistently denied wrongdoing and the probe was closed with no charges brought magnetar is pouring tens of millions of dollars annually into researching new techniques for investing photo lucy hewett for the wall street journal mr litowitz whose parents were psychoanalysts now describes the public flogging the firm received as “not my favorite period but probably partly our responsibility a little bit having not done the greatest job of articulating what we did” independent of the investigation magnetar executives had concluded some of their old trades such as spotting discrepancies in complicated financial instruments like convertible bonds had grown tired thus began a shift into new areas such as quantitative trading and investments in big money transactions like hollywood movies and commercial jets “what worked in the past will not necessarily work in the future” mr litowitz says “the traditional hedgefund world has to come to grips” with a new reality he said magnetar is pouring tens of millions of dollars annually into researching new techniques for investing onefifth of the firm’s person staff now works in technology a standalone minneapolis office houses quantitative researchers who produce sometimes counterintuitive advice in one example they advised the firm’s investment staff to largely ignore traditional metrics in stock picking like executives’ ownership of their own company’s stock because such statistics are weak

in and out of securities the firm cast a wide net for the next big wins in one instance scoring handsomely on chinese ecommerce giant alibaba before its public debut and in another investing in thousands of commercial trucks and singlefamily homes “we would have never thought we’d ever be in these businesses before” says dave snyderman magnetar’s global head of fixed income from left alec litowitz magnetar’s founder and ceo david snyderman global head of fixed income and ross laser cofounder and president magnetar executives say there still remains a key role for human decisionmaking photo lucy hewett for the wall street journal magnetar also began telling investors it would waive some fees tied to performance unless it could beat a market benchmark such an attitude was long anathema in the hedgefund world where a flat charge of  of assets under management and  cut of all profits has been the industry standard “it’s rare because most people are creatures of habit” says j tomilson hill vice chairman of the blackstone group lp which bought a minority stake in magnetar in  confident it could outlast a global hedgefund malaise “if you’re not constantly innovating…you run the risk of going obsolete” in one previously unreported move magnetar recently parted ways with its head trader—a top role at most hedge funds—to instead move to a committeebased approach where no
