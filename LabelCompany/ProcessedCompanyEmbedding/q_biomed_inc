licensing agreement for development of drug to treat rare pediatric disorder   new treatment in development looks to treat rare condition that robs approximately  us children per year of their ability to speak new york ny–april  – q biomed inc otcqb qbio and asdera llc today announce a licensing agreement that provides q biomed with the worldwide exclusive rights to asdera’s asd which is being developed to treat a rare pediatric nonverbal disorder under the terms of the agreement q biomed receives global rights to develop and commercialize the drug in the rare pediatric disease market among the more than  us children who develop autism spectrum disorders asd every year  become nonverbal or lose the ability to speak the numbers are similar in europe and this nonverbal group will have to rely on assisted living for the rest of their life denis corin ceo of q biomed said “given the severity of this disorder and the immense emotional toll on these children and their families our goal is to move the product forward quickly by using all the regulatory tools available to us to expedite the advancement of this drug candidate” the cost for treatment and assisted living in the us alone can equal or exceed ten million dollars per patient over a lifetime the estimated cost to the us healthcare system and lost productivity is estimated at  billion dollars each currently there is no treatment for this disorder eeg behavioral and genetic testing can identify a very targeted population of children in their second year of life that we believe would respond to this treatment research published in  by wittkowski et al in the nature journal translational psychiatry and independently confirmed in  by gugliemi et al indicated that certain ion channels were not active enough in this targeted population asd is designed to ameliorate this agespecific condition by activating these ion channels if the second year of life treatment window is missed many of these children may lose the ability to speak while others may never start to speak at all “we are very excited about the potential of asd and hopefully this will allow thousands of children each year to develop speech and live independent and productive lives” added corin “asdera’s mission is to focus on developing targeted therapies for diseases where there is a high unmet need” said dr knut wittkowski “we are grateful to be working with q biomed which immediately saw the potential of asd and are committed to ensuring that asd reaches its intended target patient population” about this rare pediatric nonverbal disorder early physiological and behavioral signs of becoming nonverbal appear around nine months of age and include excessive crying abnormal eye tracking and epileptiform eeg these children may never speak or might begin speaking a few words and then “regress” and lose their ability to speak while developing on the autism spectrum pathological symptoms manifest at the age of  months at which age postmortem scans reveal patchy regions of disorganization in cortical brain regions research papers ● wittkowski km sonakya v bigio b tonn mk shic f ascano m nasca c goldvon simson g a novel

chemotherapeutic   new york ny–february  – q biomed inc otcqb qbio has entered into an agreement with the oklahoma medical research foundation omrf and the rajiv gandhi centre for biotechnology rgcb to develop a chemotherapeutic technology to treat liver cancer the technology will utilize “uttroside b” and the compound’s derivatives as a chemotherapeutic agent against hepatocellular carcinoma the preclinical efficacy of uttroside b a potent saponin against liver cancer was recently demonstrated in a november   study published in scientific reports a nature journal the compound has been isolated and characterized from the leaves of solanum nigrum linn a plant widely used in traditional medicine in the scientific reports study researchers showed that in animal models uttroside b was ten times more cytotoxic to the hepg liver cancer cell line than the only drug currently approved by the food and drug administration for liver cancer uttroside b drastically shrunk tumors in mice bearing human liver cancer xenografts in addition in preclinical experiments uttroside b induced cytotoxicity in all liver cancer cell lines irrespective of their hepatitis b virus status while being nontoxic to normal immortalized hepatocytes chemotherapeutic options for liver cancer are limited and the prognosis of patients remains challenging according to the centers for disease control and prevention it is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide claiming approximately  lives each year in the us the american cancer society estimates that  people will be diagnosed with primary liver cancer in  and that  will die from the disease this year the currently available drug has been shown to increase survival by only a short period of time that drug also been reported to carry a variety of serious side effects including increased blood pressure bleeding problems decreased blood flow to the heart and heart attacks in the scientific reports study uttroside b was shown to be several times more potent than the currently available drug and did not cause noticeable side effects in vitro or in vivo “we are encouraged by the preclinical results we observed in this data and look forward to working with our collaborators at omrf and rgcb to carry out further preclinical and clinical evaluation of uttroside b” q biomed inc ceo denis corin said “our ultimate goal is to use it as an effective chemotherapeutic against liver cancer which currently has very few therapeutic options” the uttroside b technology is covered by a provisional patent application to see the full

downtrend since that time but recently that’s changed with a key revelation coming out of the qbio camp regarding the production launch of a nonnarcotic cancer pain treatment q biomed inc otcmktsqbio announced that it had initiated production of strontium chloride a radiopharmaceutical indicated for the analgesic treatment of metastatic breast and prostate cancer bone pain to give a little background on how it works– following intravenous injection soluble strontium compounds behave like their calcium analogs clearing rapidly from the blood and selectively localizing in bone mineral uptake of strontium by bone occurs preferentially in sites of active osteogenesis thus primary bone tumors and areas of metastatic involvement blastic lesions can accumulate significantly greater concentrations of strontium than surrounding normal bone strontium chloride is retained in metastatic bone lesions much longer than in normal bone where turnover is about  days strontium is a pure beta emitter and strontium chloride selectively irradiates sites of primary and metastatic bone involvement with minimal irradiation of soft tissues distant from the bone lesions clinical trials have examined relief of pain in cancer patients who have received therapy for bone metastases external radiation to indexed sites but in whom persistent pain recurred denis corin ceo of the company said “this is a major milestone in our short history we are very excited to bring this product to market less than one year after finalizing the licensing agreement there is an acute demand for an affordable and effective alternative to opiate based drugs in this patient population we know this proven drug is effective and well tolerated with limited sideeffects we look forward to making it available as widely as possible and as quickly as possible we believe there is significant opportunity to build this franchise and expand the revenue opportunity associated with it” approximately  of patients with advanced breast and prostate cancer metastases will develop bone metastases an extremely painful condition bone metastases occur in most tumor types but are most prevalent in cancers of the breast prostate and lung these bone lesions can cause serious skeletal complications including spinal cord or nerve root compression hypercalcemia of malignancy pathologic fractures and severe bone pain which can significantly compromise quality of life and may negatively affect survival palliation of pain prevention of skeletal complications and maintenance of quality of life are the primary objectives in managing patients with metastatic bone disease abrated strontium chloride sr injection usp sr can be used in combination with or to reduce the need for opiate based drugs as well as in combination with cancer therapeutic drugs after administration pain relief can occur in as little as one to two weeks and can last several months when another dose can be administered with minimal side effects source pr newswire it’s an exciting revelation for the company and to go along with the kicking off of strontium production qbio stock itself has been rebounding off of its lowest
