exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions and other fees will be placed in a new york new york based trust account at jp morgan chase bank na with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes if any the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of a the completion of our initial business combination or b the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our sponsor loaned us  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein ii a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem and iii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover some of these competitors may possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a cayman islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not selected any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any potential business combination target we will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing investing and operating expertise of our management that will be led by mr fersen lambranho our chairman and mr
