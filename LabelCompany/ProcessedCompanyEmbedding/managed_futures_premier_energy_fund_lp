appreciation through speculative trading directly or indirectly in commodity interests including commodity futures and commodity option contracts traded on united states exchanges and certain foreign exchanges and swaps the partnership intends to trade only energy and energyrelated products but is authorized to trade commodity futures swaps and option contracts of any kind the partnership had invested substantially all of its capital in the master prior to its full redemption from the master effective december   aaa was authorized to trade forward contracts on behalf of the partnership but did not do so certain swaps that the advisor traded were however the substantial economic equivalent of forward contracts the general partner manages all business of the partnership the general partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the partnerships assets to the advisor the general partner engages a team of approximately  professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the general partner a fulltime staff of due diligence professionals uses proprietary technology and onsite evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money managers the accounting and operations staff provides processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities the general partner also includes staff involved in marketing and sales support in selecting the advisor for the partnership as applicable the general partner considered past performance trading style volatility of markets traded and fee requirements the general partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the advisor at any time responsibilities of the general partnermanaging member include or included as applicable due diligence examinations of the advisor selection appointment and termination of the advisor negotiation of the management agreement and monitoring the activity of the advisor in addition the general partner provides or will assist ssc in providing and the managing member provided the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with operation of the partnershipmaster while the partnership has the right to seek lower commission rates and fees from other commodity brokers at any time the general partner believes that the customer agreements and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair reasonable and competitive pan capital management lp effective february   pan commenced trading the partnerships assets directly pursuant to its energy trading program a proprietary discretionary trading program pan will concentrate the partnerships trading in energyrelated markets risk management is an integrated part of pans goal of identifying favorable riskreward trading opportunities for its energy trading program pan will monitor risks of all positions and will attempt to prevent overconcentration of particular investment asset or strategy aaa capital management advisors ltd from inception to december   the partnerships and the masters sole trading advisor was aaa the partnerships assets allocated to aaa for trading were not invested in commodity interests directly prior to its full redemption effective december   aaas allocation of the partnerships assets was invested in the master aaa traded the masters and thereby the partnerships assets in accordance with its energy program  futures and swaps the master traded energy futures contracts and options on energy futures contracts on domestic and international exchanges as well as the goldman sachs commodity index an index future comprised of energy and other products traded on the chicago mercantile exchange the master also engaged in swap transactions involving crude oil and other energyrelated products references herein to energy and energyrelated products include all of the foregoing aaa generally based its trading decisions on fundamental factors namely supply and demand for a particular group or type of commodity aaa attempted to buy undervalued commodities and sell overvalued commodities often but not always simultaneously aaa used options to attempt either to reduce or define risks aaa was aware of price trends but did not trade upon trends aaa often took profits in positions with specific trends even though that trend may still have been intact or perhaps even strong aaa occasionally established positions that were countertrend effective risk management was a crucial aspect of aaas trading program account size expectation volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions taken were all factors in determining the amount of equity committed to each trade the master was aaas largest account a liquidity the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services its assets are its i equity in its trading account consisting of cash at msco and cash margin net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts options purchased at fair value and investment in us treasury bills at fair value if applicable ii cash at bank and iii interest receivable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership through its investments in the funds and direct investments while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended december   to minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits the partnership and the master prior to the masters full redemption followed certain trading policies including i the partnership invested its assets only in commodity interests that the advisor believed were traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions sufficient volume in this context referred to a level of liquidity that the advisor believed permitted it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market ii the advisor did not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would have resulted in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than   of the partnerships net assets allocated to the advisor iii the partnership may have occasionally accepted delivery of a commodity unless such delivery was disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse the physical commodity position was fully hedged iv the partnership did not employ the trading technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities v the partnership did not utilize borrowings other than shortterm borrowings if the partnership took delivery of any cash commodities vi the advisor may have from time to time employed trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the partnership spreads and straddles describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets vii the partnership did not permit the churning of its commodity trading account the term churning refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades driven by the desire to generate commission income from january   through december   the partnerships average margin to equity ratio ie the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin was approximately  in the normal course of business the partnership is party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments these financial instruments may include futures options and swaps whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may trade on an exchange or overthecounter otc exchangetraded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward option and swap contracts certain swap contracts may also trade on a swap execution facility or otc otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted the purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option the writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract none of the partnerships current contracts are traded otc although contracts may be traded otc in the future as both a buyer and seller of options the partnership andor the master as applicable paid or received a premium at the outset and then assumed the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option written options exposed the partnershipmaster to potentially unlimited liability for purchased options the risk of loss was limited to the premiums paid certain written put options permitted cash settlement and did not require the option holder to own the reference asset the partnershipmaster did not consider these contracts to be guarantees market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the partnership due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by the partnership the partnership is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract in the event of a counterparty default the partnerships risk of loss is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnerships risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnership to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnershipmaster had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods as msco andor cgm or their affiliates were the counterparties or brokers with respect to the partnershipsmasters assets during the reporting period and prior periods credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments was reduced to the extent that through mscocgm the partnershipsmasters counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization the partnership continues to be subject to such risks with respect to msco the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnerships net assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a result of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under new york law during the reporting period and prior periods the advisor concentrated the partnershipsmasters trading in energyrelated markets concentration in a limited number of commodity interests may have subjected the partnershipsmasters account to greater volatility than if a more diversified portfolio of contracts had been traded on behalf of the partnershipmaster the partnership continues to be subject to such risk the general partner monitors and attempts to control the partnerships risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it had effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnership may have been subject these monitoring systems generally allowed the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with riskadjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provided account analysis of futures forward and option contracts by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions see also item  financial statements and supplementary data for further information on financial instrument risks included in the notes to financial statements the majority of these instruments matured within one year of the inception date however due to the nature of the partnerships business these instruments may not have been held to maturity other than the risks inherent in us treasury bills money market mutual fund securities commodity futures options and swaps trading the partnershipmaster knew of no trends demands commitments events or uncertainties which would have resulted in or which are reasonably likely to have resulted in the partnershipsmasters liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way the limited partnership agreement provides that the general partner may cause the partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all open positions under certain circumstances including a decrease in net asset value per redeemable unit to less than  as of the close of business on any business day i the partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures ii the partnerships capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses interest income redemptions of redeemable units and distributions of profits if any gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the advisor may or may not be able to identify such as changing supply and demand relationships weather government agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates partnership expenses consist of among other things clearing ongoing selling agent management and general partner fees the level of these expenses is dependent upon the level of trading and the ability of the advisor to identify and take advantage of price movements in the commodity markets in addition to the level of net assets maintained in addition the amount of interest income earned by the partnership is dependent upon  the average daily equity maintained in cash in the partnerships account  the amount of us treasury bills andor money market mutual fund securities held by the partnership and  interest rates over which neither the partnership nor msco has no control no forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period a limited partner may require the partnership to redeem its redeemable units at their net asset value as of the end of a month on three business days notice to the general partner there is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions redemptions generally are funded out of the partnerships cash holdings for the year ended december    limited partner redeemable units were redeemed

to  for the year ended december   the net asset value per redeemable unit decreased  from  to  the partnership experienced a net trading gain of  before fees and expenses for the year ended december   gains were primarily attributable to the partnerships trading of commodity futures in natural gas the net trading gain or loss realized from the partnership is disclosed under item  financial statements and supplementary data the partnership recorded its most significant gains during the last week of july as the partnership benefitted from a move from net short positioning in natural gas futures to net long driven by increasingly hot dry weather in the us a seasonably weak increase in inventories and growing demand from power generation natural gas prices rallied strongly in the final days of the month gains were also achieved during september from the partnerships long positioning as a surge in natural gas prices during the second week of the month provided most of the partnerships gains for the month the release of industry reports which showed a flattening supply outlook combined with increased demand nationally for natural gas drove prices higher in september the partnership also recorded gains throughout the latter half of august as the partnerships advisor increased overall long exposure at the same time that natural gas prices began to rally spurred by extremely hot temperatures in the us which bolstered cooling demand from homes and businesses during october gains were achieved late in the month as mild weather patterns in the us caused natural gas prices to plunge benefitting the partnerships short positions gains were also achieved during may as prices fell dramatically over the first several days of the month and followed with choppy price action closing out a volatile first week benefitting the partnerships short positioning a portion of the partnerships gains for the year was offset by losses incurred during february from long positions in natural gas futures as mild weather throughout much of the us limited demand for natural gas and moved prices dramatically lower the partnerships net long positioning was also negatively affected during february after the release of us energy information administration the eia reports which indicated that output from us shale formations was overwhelming demand for fuel and inflated the largest natural gas supply glut in the us in four years losses were recorded during november from the partnerships net short natural gas positioning as prices rallied sharply over the months final days additional losses were experienced during april as choppy price actions dominated natural gas markets during the first half of the month a spike in natural gas prices due to unseasonably cold weather in the northeastern us during the latter half of april also adversely affected the partnerships positions smaller losses were recorded during the early days of march as a sharp drop in natural gas prices negatively affected the partnerships long positions the partnership experienced a net trading loss of  before fees and expenses for the year ended december   losses were primarily attributable to the partnerships trading of commodity futures in natural gas the partnership recorded the most significant losses during february losses were incurred at the start of the february due to short positions in natural gas futures after severe weather in the us midwest and northeast spurred demand for heating from homes and businesses in the middle of february weather again drove natural gas prices higher as much of the country faced colderthannormal temperatures additionally an industry report released in midfebruaryindicated that the number of working natural gas rigs in the us decreased during january adding further upward pressure to gas prices during december losses were experienced as milder thannormal weather throughout much of the us pushed natural gas prices lower negatively affecting the partnerships net long positioning additional losses were recorded during june as an increase in prices early in the month resulted in losses for the funds shortbiased positions later in june following a move to a net long positioning the fund recorded further losses as prices moved lower on weak cooling demand driven by mild weather in much of the us losses were also incurred during july as falling natural gas prices driven by robust supplies mild temperatures and low demand in the us negatively affected the partnerships net long bias during the month the partnerships natural gas positions also recorded smaller losses during april may and october a portion of the partnerships losses during the year was offset by gains achieved during march as a fall in natural gas prices at the start of the month positively affected short positions the partnerships short positioning bias also benefitted from the release of an energy information agency report in the middle of march which indicated that residential and business natural gas consumption fell during the early stages of the month mild weather that blanketed many of the major gasconsuming regions in the us throughout march combined with the release of a report which showed that natural gas inventories advanced from the same period in the previous year to help the partnerships short positions
