exchange act  cfr ec          item  disposition of assets   the “company” refers to british cambridge inc   on september   at a meeting of our majority shareholders and board of directors a motion was presented and resolved to sell the comprehensive rights to the company’s online education platform to british cambridge college including any propriety code british cambridge college is considered a related party and is in part owned by both our ceo teodoro g bondoc jr and president hatadi shapiro supaat the consideration british cambridge college paid for the platform to the company was    during the three month period ended june   british cambridge college paid us  in advance payments to be put toward the lease of our online education platform because we have sold the online education platform to them we have agreed that the advance payments will be considered as the monetary consideration in the above transaction as a result there was no physical exchange of cash regarding the above transaction   the lease agreement executed on august   between the two aforementioned parties is now terminated     the above description of the material terms of the aforementioned agreement is simply a summary and should be read in its entirety it is included herein as exhibit  of this form k   item  other events   as described below the nature of our business and operations have changed we have adopted a new businesses plan as a result we have included below a description of our new plan moving forward including the industry we will operate in and any applicable risk factors that relate to our new course of business it should be noted that at this time all of our officers and directors will remain in their respective positions with the company   industry overview        the global consulting industry has a total value of around  billion and is one of the most substantial markets within the larger professional services industry as the global economy fluctuates so too does the consulting industry in any economy experiencing growth higher revenues and budgets this creates a setting in which companies are more willing to spend their revenue on consultation services of course that also means that when countries experience and economic downturn this alters their spending behavior and typically results in cutting down on their consultation budgets   despite the close link between the consulting industry and a country’s economy it is notable that between the s up to the s the global consulting market grew every single year despite two recession periods however in  and later between  and  the consultation industry contracted due to global financial crises         according to httpwwwconsultancyukconsultingindustryglobal the consulting industry was valued at around  billion and since then the market has grown with an average compound annual growth rate cagr of  to a value of  billion in  for many years globalization consolidation developments in laws and legislation efficiency and technology have acted as the main growth drivers of the global consulting industry more recently digital and business model disruption has surfaced as the driving factor behind growth in particular in the more mature markets   relevant data regarding how many consulting firms offer comparable services ie assist in taking a company public onto a recognized exchange are incredibly difficult to come by because the range of services consultants offer can vary so broadly and can fluctuate on a case by case basis many consultants tailor their services to each individual client and thereby if going public is ideal for their client then they will attempt to assist in that process however in addition to general consulting there are certain subsections of the industry which are noteworthy   the five main branches of the consulting industry are strategy operations financial advisory human resources and technology strategy consulting also termed boardroom consulting focuses on ‘big picture’ consultation services which are typically provided to executives members of the board of directors etc operations relates to the day to day running and operations of a company and human resources relates directly to its namesake financial consulting is built on an analytic foundation and can cover a wide range of topics relating to a company’s finances technology consulting is increasingly important as technology continues to evolve and industry professionals find their skills in higher demand   general consulting can cover some of or all of the branches of consultation and is rather difficult to quantify while we believe that our services can fit into several of the aforementioned branches it may be more accurate to state that we provide general consultation services this puts us directly into competition with tens of thousands of other companies and as the industry continues to evolve and grow the competition for the growing market share will only become stronger     business plan      we british cambridge inc have changed the nature of our business and operations from marketing our online education platform ‘british cambridge college’ to business consulting specifically we aim to provide small businesses with consulting services relating to going public on the overthecounter otc marketplace a united states financial listing platform and may evaluate assisting companies to go public on other as of this time unidentified exchanges from time to time upon request we may also assist our clients in becoming sec reporting via a form  an s registration statement or other comparable registration statement   we will charge a flat fee for our business consulting services depending upon the consulting service that is being requested as of this point in time the fees we intend to charge prospective clients are undecided however they will likely be determined on a case by case basis the determination of our fees can vary based on a number of factors including but not limited to the size of the client’s company the amount of time each project is likely to take the difficulty inherent in every project etc   we will not be offering our clients investment or legal advice nor do we anticipate that we will be conducting any sec filings on behalf of our clients our primary focus is on connecting our clients to reputable service providers in the united states that can assist our client’s in going public becoming sec reporting or assisting with other related services upon connecting our clients with these service providers we will oversee their operations in order to ensure that they are carrying out their tasks in a reasonable amount of time and providing work that lives up to our standards   we anticipate that our services will extend to assisting our clients by providing the communication link between their company and the us service providers as an example we may provide services relating to bettering our clients’ business plans and other material necessary for a us service provider in order to complete their services   additionally we may offer advice and consultation to any of our clients who are seeking to conduct mergers and acquisitions as before our advisory and consultancy services should not be misconstrued as providing legal or investment advice to our clients   going forward we will use company revenue and available cash to fund our operations we may also seek to acquire and maintain equity in some of our clients’ companies seeking to go public on various exchanges in lieu of full cash payments our initial focus will be on businesses located in the philippines where our company is currently located however we do have future unidentified plans to expand into other areas in asia at this time we do not have a definitive marketing plans  we do however have a website that is in development which will showcase the services we will offer to our clients we believe that the website will be completed in the next few months                  risk factors        due to the fact that we have changed the nature of our business th british cambridge institute bci enters into a

of the contracts we will have in place shortly � strong competition in the education market especially in the online education market could decrease our market share the education industry is highly competitive we compete with various institutes traditional colleges and universities who may offer similar online platforms to our own in addition some of our competitors including both traditional colleges and universities may have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential learners and

affected � notwithstanding the above we are also currently a �smaller reporting company� meaning that we are not an investment company an assetbacked issuer or a majorityowned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than  million and annual revenues of less than  million during the most recently completed fiscal year in the event that we are still considered a �smaller reporting company� at such time are we cease being an �emerging growth company� the disclosure we will be required to provide in our sec filings will increase but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an �emerging growth company� or a �smaller reporting company� specifically similar to �emerging growth companies� �smaller reporting companies� are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings are exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their sec filings including among other things being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports decreased disclosures in our sec filings due to our status as an �emerging growth company� or �smaller reporting company� may make it harder for investors to analyze the company�s results of operations and financial prospects � we are an �emerging growth company� under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors � we are an �emerging growth company� as defined in the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not �emerging growth companies� including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile � in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an �emerging growth company� can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an �emerging growth company� can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates � we will remain an �emerging growth company� for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million � as we are a publicly reporting company we will continue to incur significant costs in staying current with reporting requirements our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives additionally the lack of an internal audit group may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and ability to provide accurate financial information to our shareholders � our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives to maintain reporting status moreover these rules and regulations which are necessary to remain as an sec reporting company will be costly as an external third party consultants attorney or firm may have to assist in some regard to following the applicable rules and regulations for each filing on behalf of the company � we currently do not have an internal audit group and we will eventually need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to have effective internal controls for financial reporting additionally due to the fact that our officers and director have limited experience as an officer or director of a reporting company such lack of experience may impair our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures which may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and an inability to provide accurate financial information to our stockholders � moreover if we are not able to comply with the requirements or regulations as an sec reporting company in any regard we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources �   �� table of contents � our officers and directors lack experience in and with the reporting and disclosure obligations of publiclytraded companies � our officers and directors lack experience in and with the reporting and disclosure obligations of publiclytraded companies and with serving as an officer and or director of a publiclytraded company such lack of experience may impair our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures which may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and an inability to provide accurate financial information to our stockholders consequently our operations future earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to our officers� and director�s ultimate lack of experience in our industry and with publiclytraded companies and their reporting requirements in general � risks relating to the company�s securities � we may never have a public market for our common stock or may never trade on a recognized exchange therefore you may be unable to liquidate your investment in our stock � there is no established public trading market for our securities our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system � in order for our shares to be quoted a market maker must agree to file the necessary documents with the national association of securities dealers which operates the otcqb in addition it is possible that such application for quotation may not be approved and even if approved it is possible that a regular trading market will not develop or that if it did develop will be sustained in the absence of a trading market an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment � we may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders � our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock of which  shares are issued and outstanding as of november   the future issuance of our common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our then existing stockholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock � we may issue shares of preferred stock in the future that may adversely impact your rights as holders of our common stock � our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock accordingly our board of directors will have the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares as well as the authority to issue such shares without further stockholder approval currently each one  share of preferred stock shall have voting rights held at all stockholders� meetings for all purposes including election of directors equal to one hundred  shares of common stock � our preferred stock does not have any dividend conversion liquidation or other rights or preferences including redemption or sinking fund provisions however our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividends before dividends are declared to holders of our common stock and the right to the redemption of such preferred shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of the common stock to the extent that we do issue such additional shares of preferred stock your rights as holders of common stock could be impaired thereby including without limitation dilution of your ownership interests in us in addition shares of preferred stock could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult which may not be in your interest as holders of common stock � we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock � we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future we currently intend to invest our future earnings if any to fund our growth therefore you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares �   � table of contents � we may be exposed to potential risks resulting from requirements under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  � as a reporting company we are required pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we do not have a sufficient number of employees to segregate responsibilities and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of employees � we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result our directors have the ability among other things to determine their own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations � the costs to meet our reporting and other requirements as a public company subject to the exchange act of  is and will be substantial and may result in us having insufficient funds to expand our business or even to meet routine business obligations � as a public entity subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act of  we will continue to incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements we estimate that these costs will range up to  per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases as a result we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations � state securities laws may limit secondary trading which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell shares � secondary trading in our common stock may not be possible in any state until the common stock is qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals is available for secondary trading in the state if we fail to register or qualify or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of the common stock in any particular state the common stock cannot be offered or sold to or purchased by a resident of that state in the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock the liquidity for the common stock could be significantly impacted � risks relating to this offering � investors cannot withdraw funds once invested and will not receive a refund � investors do not have the right to withdraw invested funds

offering this may pose a conflict of interest since he is also selling shares on behalf of the company in this offering it is possible that this conflict of interest could affect the ultimate amount of funds raised by the company this could negatively affect your investment � as previously mentioned mr supaat is going to be selling shares on behalf of the company in this offering mr supaat is also simultaneously having his shares registered for resale this conflict of interest could divert mr supaat�s time and attention in selling shares on behalf of the company since he will also be able to sell his own shares several factors that could result are less monies raised by the company and less desire to purchase shares by investors to name a few negative consequences because of this your investment could be adversely affected �   � table of contents � our president and chairman of our board of directors hatadi shapiro supaat does not have any prior experience conducting a best effort offering and our best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised as a result we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and our investors may lose their entire investment � mr supaat does not have any experience conducting a bestefforts offering consequently we may not be able to raise the funds needed to commence business operations also the best efforts offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a bestefforts offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us � the trading in our shares will be regulated by the securities and exchange commission rule g which established the definition of a �penny stock� � the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the �exchange act� and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure

in particular among colleges and universities worldwide has become increasingly competitive as more and more educational institutions crop up to take advantage of this large and consistent market the education industry has evolved from its roots in the traditional setting of onlocation education with the emergence and increasing popularity of the internet elearning is an increasingly popular option among the youth and even adult learners of today and shows no signs of slowing down with more and more individuals opting to take their education online now than ever before the emergence of online learning has helped the education industry expand its reach among students not just in developed countries but in developing countries alike due to advances in technology and a greater accessibility to the internet however there are still students interested in learning from countries that do not as of yet have stable internet access and to cater to these individuals the more traditional methods of learning are more appropriate currently the worldwide higher education industry is a  trillion dollar industry with the elearning industry poised to reach  billion dollars by the end of  as technology advances so does elearning or in other words �the online learning platform� today online learning platforms now make it possible to keep costs of tuition down considerably and expenses of higher learning institutions at new record lows the reasoning is simple and rests on the fact that most of the material is nonphysical and not in print form a student can now attend a class from the comfort of their home rather than attending a classroom they can can also view most of their study materials online and interact with students through online messaging boards andor discussion boards this innovation has made it financially feasible for individuals in lower income brackets to have the same education as those who come from a more wealthy country or community this is not to say however that students will not continue to seek their education in a classroom setting but rather that education is now becoming more readily available to students of a wider range of social classes and more diverse parts of the world where the classroom setting might not have been a possibility or even available   � table of contents forward looking statements � this prospectus

offering will centralized on discovering suitable employees who have the marketing background to put together a marketing campaign on our behalf methods they may employ include but are not limited to utilizing social media platforms to promote our business tv commercials print media such as magazines and online advertising � for the next twelve months as we continuously look to increase our client base we will focus on making acquisitions of unidentified entities in the field of education we feel that it would benefit us and our company�s valuation if we were able to grow through increasing our areas of business relating to education and also by creating a greater market share we have not yet identified any potential acquisition candidates nor are we sure of the cost they may impose upon us to take over we estimate that we will allocate  to this endeavor � in order to house our future employees within the first three months following this offering we anticipate that we will purchase or rent a physical facility if funds allow us to do so we will purchase a headquarters the cost of such a space will most likely be  depending on the level of funds we receive how many locations we will purchase and whether or not we will at this juncture acquire a headquarters � the remainder of the funds we raise will be used for working capital of the company and will go to further developing our existing platform and potentially designing other add on�s that we feel it may benefit from � employees � as of november   we have ten part time employees of which seven are our officers and directors

the offering price of the shares of common stock was arbitrarily determined the offering price was determined by us and is based on our own assessment of our financial condition and prospects limited offering history and the general condition of the securities market it does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value assets past operating results financial condition or any other established criteria of value although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange we will be filing to obtain a listing on the otcqb concurrently with the filing of this prospectus in order to be quoted on the otcqb a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock � there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors including the depth and liquidity of the market for the common stock investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions� ��   � table of contents � dilution � the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly higher than the price paid by the company�s officers and directors which was  as the shares were issued solely for services rendered to developing the company�s business plan dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders the following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing stockholders � the below only accounts for the primary offering on behalf of the company � existing
