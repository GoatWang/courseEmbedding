week old golden husky mix so as you can imagine she is not the smallest pup around i got the gate to prevent her from going upstairs i placed it over the first step so it would be tall enough for her to not jump over it well i have found her on several occasions up in our daughters room in the morning and one night i decided to spy on her and see how she got upstairs this gate has bars that are way to far apart with big gaps for something that is supposed to keep dogs out it does not do its job the last bars on the outside are bent which gives it even more space for someone to get through i saw my  week old lb puppy wiggle her way in through the huge gaps on the gate i have a  week old golden husky mix so as you can imagine she is not the smallest pup around i got the gate to prevent her

gates by patsy on jun   i bought two of these gates for the two openings into my kitchen i had help installing them because it was difficult for me to be down on my knees long enough to bend down and turn the knobs for the install that takes dexterity and perseverance once installed i placed my  lb  week old shih tzu puppy down inside the gates i went with confidence into my bedroom and looked down and he was with me to make a long story short he found many ways to escape through the side openings and also through the bars themselves the moral of this story is these gates are not for very small puppies otherwise they are well made and satisfactory i had to put board across the inside of each gate to i bought two of these gates for the two openings into my kitchen i had help installing

to stop my little houdini time will take care of this issue … more works well by nickname on jun   this gate does what it is supposed to do i like how much the tension rods can expand and it comes with an extension if they cant go far enough i and anyone in my house dont have a problem with it but the gate opening is pretty narrow and americas expanding waistline might run into some problems this is really the only reason i gave it  stars i was worried the small door to let my cats through would be too small but its big enough my dog actually fits through it my lbs pit bull puppy gets down and crawls through it but the cats can still get by in places he cant  those expansion rods made enough room for our one cat to get by on the side between the gate and the wall and our this gate

for our one cat to get by on the side between the gate and the wall and our bigger cat jumps over the gate it was actually pretty funny when we watched him crawl through so im glad the cats are able to find ways around it without the small door open … more great sturdy gate easy to install by schipattack on jul   i bought this to go across my kitchen entryway in my apartment so my  dogs have a place to stay during the day it was super easy and quick to install no tools required unless you want to screw the pads that come with it into the wall i didnt because im renting  gate still is solid and cant be budged it is very sturdy and quickeasy to open love chewy for providing these products look at parts carefully by tibbielady on jun   i am generally pleased by the gate and it serves its purpose in keeping my tibbies in the kitchen when necessary however i suggest inspecting carefully when unpacking the parts there were two flaws in the gate parts i received one was a very slight bend in one connector between an extension and the main gate i eventually made it work but what should have been easypeasy was difficult the second flaw was that one of the four openings into which you insert the adjustable spindle rods was too large this caused the rod to move up and down in the opening i had to come up with a way to fill the opening to secure the rod again what should have been easypeasy became timeconsuming i am generally pleased by the gate and it serves its purpose in keeping my tibbies in the kitchen when necessary however i suggest inspecting carefully when unpacking

right away now that its in it works fine … more love these gates by imstillalive on jul   these gates are easy to open and close keeps my dogs out of areas they dont belong in i have five of these gates i dont use the pet door because all three of my dogs are westies and would just go right through it my cat can jump over the gate with no problem perfection by maryjo on jun   this is exactly what i needed to be able to separate my dog from my cats now my cats have a way to escape my yr old boxer when he wants to play and they dont no where else had it and if they did it was way more expensive i love chewycom not ideal for the smart escape artist by luckylonnie on may   i got this gate as a gift from my mom at first it was perfect but then my large male pup learned he could conveniently take his teeth and pull the bottom of the door and it automatically pops the top lock wallahe opens the gate and ever so sweetly lets everyone out as long as i put him on the other side of the gate where he cant pull the bottom out it will contain him and his sisters but then we just recently rescued a  month old pitbull pup who can jump and scale it like a gazelle and he doesnt have to get a run at it either he squats down low like a frog and then he is gone needless to say i have to stack my dining room table chairs up in front of it to deter him from jumping i got this gate as

the stacked chairs and push the door open with his feet and he escapes this gate has seen better days not for smart escape artists i would say it would be ideal for small pets but not my jumper and houdini … more great for blocking stairways by braudis on jun   if youre looking for a gate to block off your stairs this is the gate for it it has two extensions on either side you can use this gate for doorways as well i wouldnt recommend this to dogscats that are escape artists who may possible jump over the gate or squeeze through it just what we needed by murphy on may   i needed to stop the dogs and my grandson from going down the steps on our front porch so i decided to purchase this gate and i got a great deal at chewy it was the perfect solution and we found it easy to order extensions to make it longer and now we dont have to worry about the dogs running off and having to chase them or the kids either so this has made our life a lot easier and shopping for pet items is

noncriminal justice personbyjron february  format paperbackverified purchasethis book covers just about all the basic topics for running a correctional institution for people who work in the field most of it is too basic but there is still a lot of good information in it that even the most seasoned officer can learn from i had to have this book for a grad class and normally dont write reviews about school books but this one merits a good word because it is not your typical school book that is only for students this book would be useful for anyone involved in decision making for jails and
