macro and a microeconomic approach when making asset management decisions in individual client accounts georgia uses her projections on economic and sector trends to design each portfolio to take advantage of a diversified mix that may include cash equivalents domestic and international equities and bonds gold and precious metals and real estate within each sector she is looking at industry trends and projections as well as at individual company financials and her focus is on positioning her clients for the longterm achievement of their goals   bennicas and associates  all rights
