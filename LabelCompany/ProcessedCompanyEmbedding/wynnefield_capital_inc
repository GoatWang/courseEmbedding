investment objective is to identify opportunities in small capitalization value us stocks we perform substantial original research both on specific companies and the industries in which they operate while we may selectively short individual stocks and indexes our basic strategy is equity ownership in undervalued smallcap companies we apply generally accepted valuation metrics to both balance sheets and income statements we seek to identify industry or company catalysts which will change the perceived value of a business catalytic factors we consider include a balance sheet with little or rapidly decreasing debt changes in governmental regulation scale driven industry consolidation management succession issues or situations where management compensation is related directly to creation of shareholder value shareholder friendly governance posture tracking insider transaction filings turnaround situations where changes in the structure of a business or industry improve opportunities for realization of embedded shareholder value wynnefield maintains a proactive posture with respect to its portfolio names when it believes management is not taking appropriate measures to surface shareholder value where corporate governance issues exist or where outside assistance can be provided to a management working to implement value creating strategies in numerous cases we are schedule d and form  filers wynnefield does not generally seek out board representation however one of our members will occasionally where the size of the position and potential return warrants a higher level of resource commitment accept a board of directors seat we are not litigious and do not accept greenmail operating only for the entire class of holders of which we are part wci seeks to provide hedged returns not only through individual securities but through the use of exchange traded funds etfs when our research indicates systemic market or sector risk indications we look for include overextended valuations relative to earnings potential increasing balance sheet risk unfavorable marketplace changes for a companys products management instability extreme speculative market moves or the emergence

nyseome omega protein corporation in a letter to its shareholders has said that wynnefield is attempting to place a director on the omega board that omega feels has no relevant industry or financial experience as well as consideration of strategic alternatives that include a sale of the company wynnefield requests omega to exit human nutrition business mar   wynnefield capital inc called on omega protein corporation nyseome to exit the human nutrition business and redeploy proceeds into its profitable core business wynnefield said the companys venture into the human nutrition business has been a wasteful squandering of almost eight dollars a share of shareholder free cash flow and a textbook case of diworsification wynnefield added it is highly skeptical that the companys seemingly endless
