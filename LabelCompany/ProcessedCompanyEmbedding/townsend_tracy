–edit devin townsend was born in new westminster british columbia on may   townsend picked up the banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was  as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of  around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike young on bass ryan van poederooyen on drums and dave young on keyboards townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in strapping young lad townsend worked on the bands first album accelerated evolution at the same time he was working on strapping young lad spending half the week on one and half on the other accelerated evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after strapping young lad mike g of metal maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hardtoaccomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music the final strapping young lad album the new black was released later in  ziltoid the omniscient and hiatus –edit townsend

decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the bottom line though is i like what i like and it

was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on the solo album heavy as a really heavy thing released under the pseudonym strapping young lad he soon assembled a band under the name and released the critically acclaimed city in  since then he has released three more studio albums with strapping young lad along with solo material released under his own independent record label hevydevy records townsends solo albums a diverse mix of hard rock progressive metal ambient and newage have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians in  he formed the devin

banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was  as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of  around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike young on bass ryan van poederooyen on drums and dave young on keyboards townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in strapping young lad townsend worked on the bands first album accelerated evolution at the same time he was working on strapping young lad spending half the week on one and half on the other accelerated evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after strapping young lad mike g of metal maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hardtoaccomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music the final strapping young lad album the new black was released later in  ziltoid the omniscient and hiatus –edit townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family from home townsend completed his second solo ambient album the hummer releasing it exclusively on his website in november  in may  townsend released ziltoid the omniscient a tongueincheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien this was truly a solo album he programmed the drums using drumkit from hell a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by tomas haake of meshuggah and played all other instruments himself shortly after the albums release townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with strapping young lad or the devin townsend band he explained that he was burnt out on travelling touring and self promotion and wished to do production work write albums and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring in  townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the adult swim cartoon metalocalypse see musician cameos in metalocalypse for more the original character design for pickles the drummer one of the series main characters bore a striking resemblance to townsend the series cocreator brendon small acknowledged the similarity and altered the design before the series began we made sure he didnt look like devin townsend we gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldnt look like that creation of the devin townsend project –0edit devin townsend performing at tuska metal festival finland july  after removing himself from the music industry townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician he spent a year producing albums in absence of writing but found it unrewarding and decided to pick up the guitar and just write this began a period of self discovery where he learned how to create without drugs over two years townsend wrote over 0 songs and found that they fit into four distinct styles in march  townsend announced his plans for a fouralbum series called devin townsend project with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being accountable for the persona he projects to the public the projects concept includes a different theme and a different group of musicians on each album ki

on heavyblogisheavycom the peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things really work in the business side of endorsements and i can’t say i really enjoyed it but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good i really like that v however i decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a sadowsky tele set a framus hollowbody group of guitars and the v’s no one is entirely happy with that decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the

replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike young on bass ryan van poederooyen on drums and dave young on keyboards townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in strapping young lad townsend worked on the bands first album accelerated evolution at the same time he was working on strapping young lad spending half the week on one and half on the other accelerated evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after strapping young lad mike g of metal maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hardtoaccomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music the final strapping young lad album the new black was released later in  ziltoid the omniscient and hiatus –edit townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family from home townsend completed his second solo ambient album the hummer releasing it exclusively on his website in november  in may  townsend released ziltoid the omniscient a tongueincheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien this was truly a solo album he programmed the drums using drumkit from hell a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by tomas haake of meshuggah and played all other instruments himself shortly after the albums release townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with strapping young lad or the devin townsend band he explained that he was burnt out on travelling touring and self promotion and wished to do production work write albums and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring in  townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the adult swim cartoon metalocalypse see musician cameos in metalocalypse for more the original character design for pickles the drummer one of the series main characters bore a striking resemblance to townsend the series cocreator brendon small acknowledged the similarity and altered the design before the series began we made sure he didnt look like devin townsend we gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldnt look like that creation of the devin townsend project –0edit devin townsend performing at tuska metal festival finland july  after removing himself from the music industry townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician he spent a

on heavyblogisheavycom the peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things really work in the business side of endorsements and i can’t say i really enjoyed it but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good i really like that v however i decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a sadowsky tele set a framus hollowbody group of guitars and the v’s no one is entirely happy with that decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the

banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was  as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of  around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike young on bass ryan van poederooyen on drums and dave young on keyboards townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in strapping young lad townsend worked on the bands first album accelerated evolution at the same time he was working on strapping young lad spending half the week on one and half on the other accelerated evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after strapping young lad mike g of metal maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hardtoaccomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music the final strapping young lad album the new black was released later in  ziltoid the omniscient and hiatus –edit townsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family from home townsend completed his second solo ambient album the hummer releasing it exclusively on his website in november  in may  townsend released ziltoid the omniscient a tongueincheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien this was truly a solo album he programmed the drums using drumkit from hell a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by tomas haake of meshuggah and played all other instruments himself shortly after the albums release townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with strapping young lad or the devin townsend band he explained that he was burnt out on travelling touring and self promotion and wished to do production work write albums and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring in  townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the adult swim cartoon metalocalypse see musician cameos in metalocalypse for more the original character design for pickles the drummer one of the series main characters bore a striking resemblance to townsend the series cocreator brendon small acknowledged the similarity and altered the design before the series began we made sure he didnt look like devin townsend we gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldnt look like that creation of the devin townsend project –0edit devin townsend performing at tuska metal festival finland july  after removing himself from the music industry townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician he spent a

playing an esp flying vstyle string with a single emg  pickup and a custom graphic designed by townsend this was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of heavy as a really heavy thing and the shows in support of city in addition to this guitar townsend also utilized an esp exp explorerstyle guitar with two emg  pickups during the late 0s and the s he was also seen with two esp telecaster models one white one black with emg  pickups which were used for the majority of his sixstring material townsend also utilized two esp custom shop horizon string guitars with a  baritone scale and emg  pickups which closely resembled esps stephen carpenter signature model he has also been seen with the stephen carpenter sc0 and sc0b he was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a fender american deluxe stratocaster hss during accelerated evolution and synchestraera shows mainly for performing deadhead at the time this was the only guitar devin townsend was seen with that did not have emg pickups but was modified with a seymour duncan stksn hot stack in the neck after returning to public view in  townsend began endorsing peavey and later released a pxd devin townsend signature model essentially a flying vstyle string baritone guitar with an emg  pickup and a string emg sa single coil pickup in the neck position peavey also made townsend a number of custom strings including one with a single emg  pickup that is used for playing most of the material on ziltoid the omniscient aside from his signature model townsend also utilizes two custom string predator models made by peavey one with a natural flametop finish and the dtp logo on the th fret and one in a black finish with a floyd rose vibrato unit for open c and open b tuning respectively in 0 townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his peavey models including two sadowsky telecaster models and a number of framus semihollow body guitars in regard to this townsend stated on heavyblogisheavycom the peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things really work in the business side of endorsements and i can’t say i really enjoyed it but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good i really like that v however i decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a sadowsky tele set a framus hollowbody group of guitars and the v’s no one is entirely happy with that decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the bottom line though is i like what i like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe the guitars i actually play i really like regardless of brand for strapping young lad and solo projects from  –  townsend mainly used the peavey 0 head with mesa boogie and marshall x cabinets for his main sounds around 0 townsend began to utilize mesaboogie dual rectifier and stiletto amp heads boosted with a maxon od0 running into mesaboogie x cabinets and marshall x cabinets he would also run a rd signal into a 0s roland gp which would be amplified by a mesaboogie tube power amp he would still make use of the peavey head for some solo recordings such as synchestra he switched to a fractal audio axefx system in  replacing his entire mesaboogie and marshall rig he has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echoreverb effects something that townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound one of his favorites is the roland gp a unit that townsend still uses along with his fractal units he also used a tc electronic gforce in tandem with his mesaboogie rig townsend also utilizes daddario strings  and  and planet waves custom series cables as of 0 he reintroduced the dual rectifier into his rig using a wetdrywet setup with the dual rectifier being the center dry sound and the axefx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the dual rectifier as a basis in  for live shows the dual rectifier was replaced with a kemper profiling amplifier and the roland gp was retired in favor of effects in the fractal axefx at namm 0

of heavy metal bands in high school townsend was discovered by a record label in  and was asked to perform lead vocals on steve vais album sex  religion after recording and touring with vai townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on the solo album heavy as a really heavy thing released under the pseudonym strapping young lad he soon assembled a band under the name and released the critically acclaimed city in  since then he has released three more studio albums with strapping young lad along with solo material released under his own independent record label hevydevy records townsends solo albums a diverse mix of hard rock progressive metal ambient and newage have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians in  he formed the devin townsend band a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases in  he disbanded both strapping young lad and the devin townsend band taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family after a twoyear hiatus he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the devin townsend project the project began with a series of four albums released from  to 0 each written in a different style and townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker across all his bands and projects townsend has released twentythree studio albums and three live albums townsends trademark production style featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound has been compared to the styles of phil spector and frank zappa his versatile vocal delivery ranges from

banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was  as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of  around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping

simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased

on heavyblogisheavycom the peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things really work in the business side of endorsements and i can’t say i really enjoyed it but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good i really like that v however i decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a sadowsky tele set a framus hollowbody group of guitars and the v’s no one is entirely happy with that decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the

banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was  as an early teenager he befriended brian beav waddell who would later play guitars as part of the devin townsend band and bass on the devin townsend project he participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded grey skies at the age of  around the same time he joined a popular local group called caustic thought replacing jed simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist byron stroud both of whom would later become members of townsends flagship band strapping young lad in  townsend began writing material under the name noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as strapping young lad townsend recorded a noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels relativity records responded to townsend with a record deal and townsend began work on what was to be the first noisescapes album promise shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician steve vai impressed with townsends vocal work vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album sex and religion after recording sex and religion townsend accompanied vai on a world tour in support of the album townsend soon landed a second touring gig this time with the opening band of vais tour the wildhearts he played live with the band throughout half of  in europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single urge ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with townsend later cowriting several songs on infinity and the christeen   demos ep while on tour with the wildhearts townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with metallicas thenbassist jason newsted the band known as ir featured newsted on vocals and bass townsend on guitar and tom hunting of exodus on drums the group recorded a few songs together although townsend says that they never intended to go further than that people heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a cd which is absolutely not true he explains people took this project way too seriously a demo tape was put together but the material was not released until  when newsted published the ir vs sexoturica compilation though townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry i was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected this combination was appalling0 he pushed to get his own projects off the ground despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians however townsend continued to face rejection of his own music relativity records dropped noisescapes from their label shortly after townsend accepted vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in townsends music i have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with steve he mused while touring with the wildhearts townsend received a phone call from an ar representative for roadrunner records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him the offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of roadrunner who regarded townsends recordings as just noise heavy as a really heavy thing through infinity –edit in  century media records offered townsend a contract to make some extreme albums he agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the  album millennium and the  album hard wired by vancouver industrial band front line assembly townsend began to record material under the pseudonym strapping young lad he avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile vai gig at the beginning i wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because i was known as the singer for steve vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained i was playing somebody elses music and i was judged in respect to that music0 townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album heavy as a really heavy thing which was released in april  following the release of the record townsend and several other musician friends he knew in vancouver recorded his first solo album in  entitled punky brüster – cooked on phonics written and recorded in under a month the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success townsend founded his own independent record label hevydevy records to release the album townsend assembled a permanent lineup of strapping young lad to record city including prolific metal drummer gene hoglan along with townsends former bandmates jed simon on guitar and byron stroud on bass the industrialinfluenced album was released in  to this day the album is widely considered strapping young lads best work with metal maniacs calling it groundbreaking and revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album later that year townsend released his second solo album ocean machine biomech the album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock after the completion of city and ocean machine biomech townsend began to approach a mental breakdown i started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat he explained life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand in  he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are strappings city record and ocean machine biomech0 after being discharged from the hospital townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album infinity which he described as the parent project of city and ocean machine biomech0 with music influenced by broadway townsend returned to the studio accompanied by hoglan to work on the album on which townsend played most of the instruments infinity was released in october  later in his career townsend has cited infinity as his favorite solo record with infinity townsend began to label all albums outside of strapping young lad under his own name dropping the ocean machine moniker to reduce confusion he wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity0 the album biomech was relabeled and redistributed as ocean machine biomech under townsends name to reflect the new arrangement townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as strapping young lad and one as the devin townsend band playing songs from townsends solo albums physicist and terria –edit townsend performing at the wâldrock festival netherlands june   townsends next project took several years to come to fruition after the creation of the ir demo tape townsend and jason newsted had begun work on a new project called fizzicist which they described as heavier than strapping young lad when the ir tape was leaked newsteds metallica bandmates james hetfield and lars ulrich learned of the project hetfield was fucking pissed that newsted was playing outside the band and newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects with the project stalled townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it physicist townsend assembled his strapping young lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a devin townsend album the thrashinfluenced physicist was released in june  and is generally considered a low point in townsends career hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and townsend considers it his worst album to date feeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with physicist townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record townsend was inspired one morning while driving across canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland he produced and recorded terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with gene hoglan on drums craig mcfarland on bass and jamie meyer on keyboards townsend cited weens white pepper as an inspiration for the album terria was released in november  strapping young lad through synchestra 0–edit townsends solo run lasted until  after a fiveyear break from recording strapping young lad reunited to record a new album townsend credits the album strapping young lad as an emotional response to the attacks of september   in the united states if the worlds about to blow up said townsend lets write the soundtrack for it the albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of city musically strapping young lad was less industrial than city and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style townsend cited front line assembly grotus and samaels passage as influences the selftitled album was released in february 0 it received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to city but it was the bands first charting album entering at th place on billboards top heatseekers chart townsend filming the music video for zen with strapping young lad 0 while strapping young lad was being reunited townsend formed a new permanent band on par with strapping to record and tour for his solo releases the devin townsend band consisted of brian beav waddell on guitar mike

simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful prior to the formation of the devin townsend band townsend had represented his solo releases live with the strapping young lad lineup the band would play one set of strapping young lad songs and one set of devin townsend songs after the release of accelerated evolution townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albums strapping young lad began working on their next album alien in march  feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme to prepare for the new album townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder i think that as an artist in order for me to get to the next plateau i kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy he explains and alien was no exception with that although townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling  copies in its first week and appearing on several billboard charts around this time townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game fallout brotherhood of steel0 shortly thereafter townsend began putting together the next devin townsend band record with the working title human townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to alien its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with alien for a while the album ended up being renamed synchestra and was released in january  townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and middle eastern music the final strapping young lad album the new black was released

guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good i really like that v however i decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a sadowsky tele set a framus hollowbody group of guitars and the v’s no one is entirely happy with that decision but i find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what i want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result the
