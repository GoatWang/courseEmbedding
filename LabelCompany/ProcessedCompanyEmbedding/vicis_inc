carey federal authorities are investigating the activities of two executives at vicis capital llc a new york hedge fund operator that began last year with nearly  billion under management vicis is the biggest investor in a pair of small public companies that have been implicated in an insurance fraud scheme the fbi and a grand jury have been examining what role if any representatives of the hedge fund played in that scheme the investigation has focused attention on the close relationship between vicis and midtown partners  co llc a floridabased investment bank that has paired vicis with  companies whose shares trade mainly on the over the counter market or pink sheets sharesleuth learned of the probe while conducting its own investigation into vicis our analysis of securities and exchange commission filings shows that vicis ultimately put more than  million into those companies in return for stock warrants and notes convertible into shares midtown partners has collected at least  million in cash fees in connection with those transactions it also has received blocks of stock and warrants that were worth millions more at the time they were issued the shares of many of the companies have plunged in value even the investments showing gains for vicis are relatively illiquid and the purported profits may exist only on paper vicis and midtown partners did not respond to written questions submitted by sharesleuth the fbi declined to comment an insurance fraud case the federal investigation involves two of vicis’ portfolio companies — medical solutions management inc pink sheets msmtpk of marlborough mass and mdwerks inc otcbb mdwkob of deerfield beach fla over the past five years the hedge fund has provided roughly  million in equity and debt financing to those companies a federal grand jury in new hampshire has been hearing evidence in the fraud case which revolves around falsified receivables for benefits covered by workers’ compensation plans medical solutions management spent roughly  million to buy insurance receivables at a discount under a deal signed in  mdwerks took over the claims processing the following year authorities believe that one or both companies learned that some of the receivables were bogus but instead of reporting the problem mdwerks continued collecting on them people familiar with the investigation told sharesleuth that certain participants in the scheme have already been charged under sealed indictments the vicis executive who has been implicated in the case is christopher d phillips who has been a managing director for nearly two years he previously headed the parent company of midtown partners which is based in tampa and has been acting as a middleman for vicis in equity and debt placements since  partly because of its relationship with vicis the company ranks among the most active firms in the country in raising capital through socalled pipe private investment in public equity deals phillips was the point person for dealings between vicis and medical solutions management he also sat on mdwerk’s board of directors shad l stastney one of the hedge fund’s three founding partners was a director of both companies medical solutions management’s stock ended the year at  cents a share down from a high of  in the second quarter of  mdwerk’s stock is trading for  cents a share it peaked at  in july  other pressures in september vicis barred investors from withdrawing money after being deluged with  million in redemption requests news reports at the time said that vicis’ main fund was down  percent through the first eight months of the year after posting a  percent gain in  vicis’ most recent quarterly filing with the sec listed  billion in investments as of sept  down from  billion at end of june and  billion at sept   it is unclear what value vicis places on its investments in the companies that were brought to it by midtown partners the quarterly sec summaries did not list any of those shares or notes although hedge fund investments are typically reserved for the wealthy the vicis investigation has implications for the general public because a number of pension funds have invested money with vicis the west virginia investment management board had  million in assets with vicis at the end of november the fort worth employees’ retirement fund in texas said in august that it planned to increase its investment to  million from  million disclosure  no one associated with sharesleuth has any investment position short or long in the companies mentioned in this story   deals between companies sharesleuth noted that some of the small public companies in vicis’ portfolio have entered into daisychain deals with one another often generating additional shares and warrants for vicis and additional fees and warrants for midtown partners we also noted that some of the companies sold vicis millions of warrants – in a few cases tens of millions of warrants — that were exercisable at prices well below the prevailing market price of the shares they also repriced existing outofthemoney warrants so that the hedge fund still could exercise them at a profit it’s possible that some of those transactions created temporary gains that boosted vicis’ overall returns making its funds more attractive to investors than they otherwise would be it’s also possible that those gains boosted the profit payouts for the hedge fund’s managers hedge fund operators typically charge a  percent annual management fee and get  percent of any profits their funds generate  the hedge fund vicis was formed in  by three partners –john d succo who formerly ran derivatives trading at paine webber inc and lehman brothers inc – stastney a lawyer who had worked in derivatives at credit suisse first boston and –sky m lucas who once managed convertible bond trading at painewebber and lehman succo is chief investment officer stastney is chief operating officer and lucas is head of global convertible arbitrage vicis says it seeks to profit from volatility through arbitrage trading in stocks and options — exploiting temporary price discrepancies in similar but related securities a growing relationship vicis’ investments in the companies introduced to it by midtown partners represent a relatively small percentage of its assets under management but the hedge fund has been making increasingly large bets on those microcap companies its first placements through midtown partners were in the neighborhood of  million more recently it added  million to its stake in one company and  million to its stake in another although sharesleuth’s review of sec filings turned up  million in cash placement fees paid to midtown in the deals the total is likely higher some filings did not enumerate payments for specific transactions however midtown partners’ contracts usually call for fees of  percent or more the ties between vicis and midtown partners grew so close that phillips went to work for the hedge fund in february  stepping down from his position at midtown partners’ parent company phillis is or was on the board of four of vicis’ portfolio companies asset shuffles sharesleuth noted that vicis appeared to benefit from an asset shuffle last year involving amacore group inc otcbb acgiob a florida company in which it has a nearly  percent interest amacore which markets healthcarerelated membership programs spun off one of its divisions into a public shell at the end of july vicis has  million invested in amacore it put a further  million into the spinoff zurvita holdings inc otcbb  zrvtob a multilevel marketing company that sells discount medical benefits residential utility plans and other products zurvita also entered into deals with two other vicis portfolio companies buying assets from one and stock in another read more on those transactions below sec filings show that vicis now holds convertible preferred stock equal to  million of zurvita’s common shares it also has warrants for an additional  million shares some exercisable at  cents a share and some at  cents zurvita’s stock which has seen limited trading ended  at  a share that gives the company a market capitalization of  million – more than double that of amacore by our calculations the spinoff of zurvita and the additional  million investment boosted the imputed value of vicis’ original holdings in amacore by nearly  million a figure that excludes the zurvita warrants as part of its placement fee for the vicis financing midtown partners got warrants to buy  zurvita shares also exercisable at  cents a share and  cents the math vicis said in an sec filing in november that it held  million shares of amacore’s common stock and would hold more than  billion shares if it converted all of its preferred stock and exercised all of its warrants at the time of the spinoff amacore’s stock was trading for  cents a share giving vicis’ common shares a market value of just under  million the stock ended  at  cents putting the market value at  million the zurvita stock underlying vicis’ preferred shares would have a current market value of more than  million at amacore’s current average trading volume of just under  shares a day however it would take vicis nearly two decades to unwind its position omnireliant holdings omnireliant holdings inc otcbb orhiob may provide the best example of the interrelationship between vicis midtown partners and other entities with ties to midtown partners or its parent company omnireliant was created through a reverse merger in  the company is based in clearwater fla and says it sells luxury products through infomercials home shopping programs and other channels its offerings include a line of skincare products licensed to it by kathy hilton the mother of socialite paris hilton apogee financial consultants inc the parent company of midtown partners got  million shares in the newly minted omnireliant vicis provided  million in capital in exchange for convertible preferred stock and warrants for  million common shares midtown partners received warrants for an additional  shares as a fee for arranging that placement christopher phillips was omnireliant’s original chief executive officer and chief financial officer he also was ceo of apogee financial and held a  percent membership interest in midtown partners sec filings show vicis has since invested around  million in omnireliant through the purchase of convertible preferred stock the purchase of warrants and the exercise of warrants phillips remains on omnireliant’s board of directors and still is listed as the registrant of the company’s internet domain according to sec filings apogee and midtown partners received cash placement fees of  million from omnireliant in the two years that ended june   and got warrants with a fair value of  million those filings show that vicis holds  million shares of omnireliant’s common stock along with warrants for  million additional shares omnireliant had  million in revenue for the first quarter of its current fiscal year it reported a loss of  million with much of that attributable to accounting adjustments related to its financing transactions with vicis omnireliant had  million in revenue in its prior fiscal year and posted a loss of  million end of quarter stock moves sharesleuth noted that the market price of omnireliant’s stock often rises sharply as the close of a quarter approaches on sept  for instance the price jumped from  cents a share to  cents a share on a trading volume of just  shares there were no other trades for the rest of the month and the stock ended the quarter at  cents at the end of march the stock shot from  cents to  on a day when  shares traded hands and on the last day of december  omnireliant’s shares went from  cents to  in each instance the price moves lifted the market value of vicis’ and midtown partners’ holdings at the end of the quarter back to the level where they had finished the previous quarter omnireliant’s shares did not have the same kind of gain at the end of the latest quarter the stock ended  at  cents after rising  cents in the last few trading days vicis’ common shares in omnireliant now have a market value of  million down from  million on sept  warrant deals in july omnireliant and vicis entered into a deal in which vicis paid  million and got a warrant to buy  million common shares at  cents a share the hedge fund surrendered an equal number of old warrants exercisable at higher prices at the time the stock was at  although no shares had actually traded since late april vicis also converted all  million of its preferred shares in omnireliant to common shares giving it a  percent stake in the company on sept  vicis’ board agreed to reduce the exercise price of the new warrants to  cents the hedge fund converted  million of the warrants to shares paying a further  million on the day that vicis completed that transaction those shares had a market value of  million sharesleuth found similar deals at other vicis portfolio companies in july  for instance medical solutions management reduced the exercise price of vicis’ outstanding warrants to a penny each in return for a payment of  million vicis then exercised all of its  million warrants — most of which had been priced at  to  a share — giving it a majority stake in the company medical solutions management’s stock price at the time was around  although trading volume was minimal related parties in addition to using midtown partners as its placement agent omnireliant entered into a consulting agreement with totalcfo llc another entity of which christopher phillips was managing director sec filings show that omnireliant paid that company  in the two years that ended june   florida corporation filings now list phillips’ sister natalie p collins and father dale e phillips as managing members of totalcfo dale phillips also is chief financial officer of apogee financial midtown partners’ parent company omnireliant paid apogee financial a  consulting fee for due diligence on a recent acquisition sec filings show that

omnireliant also bought a company called designer liquidator inc which owned  percent of rps trading for  and  shares of stock florida corporation records show that christopher phillips’ mother marilyn r phillips was one of the  managing members of rps trading and was president of designer liquidator inc florida corporation filings also list natalie collins as managing member of smallcapwatch llc a stock promotion web site that features profiles of omnireliant and three other companies in which vicis and midtown partners have stakes the corporation filings list the same address for all of the above entities except apogee financial — an office at  sterlington drive in land o’ lakes fla that also is the business address for debt opportunity fund lllp another entity

medical solutions management was supposed to get a substantial cut of the collections money under the transfer deal with mdwerks because the debt used to buy the receivables was still on medical solutions management’s books but sec filings show that medical solutions management didn’t report anything close to  million in revenue from receivables in  either disclosure questions neither medical solutions management nor mdwerks have fully disclosed the nature or scope of the investigation in their sec filings medical solutions olutions reported last jan  that its president and interim chief

clinic iisa vicis foundation coalition devblog media press awards videos images  sign up zero preorder deposit fit redefined vicis has redefined fit based on our deep understanding of elite athletes’ head shapes and our unique anatomically correct approach to sizing   the vicis axis fit system™ a great fitting helmet is critical to comfort and safety the current standard is to measure head circumference but that approach has serious limitations consider two rooms with a circumference of ’ while the rooms share the same circumference they have markedly different dimensions one measures ’ x ’ while the other measures ’ x ’ human head anatomy is also variable the same circumference could yield scores of different head lengths and breadths traditional sizing approaches do not account for these differences the vicis axis fit system incorporates head length and breadth measurements to determine a player’s optimal helmet size informed by detailed head measurements of hundreds of current and former nfl and ncaa football players the axis fit system provides an anatomically correct fit based on the unique head shapes of elite athletes the zero offers  different sizing combinations eliminating the need for shims and air bladders taking comfort and safety to a new level after determining the player’s optimal helmet size with the axis fit system the zero’s two innermost layers provide additional protection and exceptional fit and comfort  configure the vicis zero is a highlyengineered football helmet designed to reduce impact forces it is the culmination of a year m research and development effort shaped by some of the world’s leading athletes engineers and neurosurgeons the zero’s multiple layers work together to slow impact forces the helmet features a soft outer shell and an underlying layer of columns designed to mitigate collisions from multiple directions the zero delivers breakthroughs in safety based on current state of the art testing protocols it also elevates performance featuring the industry’s widest ﬁeld of peripheral view and low aerodynamic drag our tagline is protect the athleteelevate the game® – and that’s what we’ve done with the zero note the zero was designed for use by elite athletes and is recommended for players weighing over  lbs we expect to serve smaller lighter athletes with future helmet models designed for their size and level of play a helmet’s foremost job is protection vicis engineers and neurosurgeons have developed a multilayered highlyengineered helmet design that mitigates linear and rotational impact forces the lode shell®absorbs impact load by locally deforming like a car bumper automotive safety engineers have used local deformation to protect people for decades we’re the first to bring this proven innovation to football helmets vicis rflx®employs a highlyengineered columnar structure that moves omnidirectionally to reduce linear and rotational forces the columnar geometry used in our rflx layer is based on principles first described by leonhard euler a swiss physicist in the sthe lode shell and rflx layer work together to reduce impact forces leveraging well established engineering principles and materials longused in stringent aerospace and automotive applications tested to withstand multiple seasons of play the vicis zero delivers st century innovation built on bedrock scientific principles the arch shell®the axis fit system determines the relationship between head length and breadth measurements commonly called an “aspect ratio” for a player and facilitates selection of an appropriately sized arch shell there are  different arch shells available providing outstanding fit and additional protection the form liner®the form liner is designed to work in unison with the arch shell constructed of special foams and waterproof textiles the form liner conforms to the player’s unique head topography and distributes pressure uniformly around the head there are  different form liners available to enable unparalleled comfort and precise fit how it works the zero’s multiple layers work together to slow impact forces the helmet features a soft outer shell and an underlying layer of columns designed to mitigate collisions from multiple directions the zero reduces head impact severity better than any helmet on the market based on an algorithm developed for professional football to assess helmet performance this calculation incorporates both linear straightahead and rotational forces while others only consider linear impact performance supporting test results were generated by one of the leading biomechanics laboratories in north america onfield testimonials what do actual pro and college players think about the zero comfort and fit we used a datadriven approach to optimize fit below helmet pressure maps illustrate the zeros superior fit and comfort vs a leading competitor one of vicis’ founders is a neurosurgeon and some of the world’s preeminent neurosurgeons serve on the vicis council our scientiﬁc advisory board we have a deep understanding of head shape and anatomy we have incorporated feedback from these neurosurgeons and scores of elite football equipment managers to develop the vicis axis fit system® the vicis axis fit system incorporates head length and breadth measurements to determine a player’s optimal helmet

traditional helmets in laboratory testing the zero was shown to oﬀer players a  degree ﬁeld of view nearly the maximum of human peripheral vision  degrees this is nearly  degrees more than the next best traditional helmet and  degrees more than another popular traditional helmet the sooner you see the sooner you can react  based on vicis rdi lab testing attention to detail because we designed the zero from scratch we examined every part of the helmet and manufacturing process looking for improvement opportunities our facemasks are argonwelded resulting in a cleaner weld our jaw pads are engineered for easy removal in the event of an emergency every detail matters even those you cannot see every vicis facemask is constructed from high grade titanium selected for its strength and weight properties traditional competitors weld their masks in the presence of room air which contains oxygen oxygen is detrimental to titanium we bathe our welds in argon gas to purge room air that may be present you can see the diﬀerence in our welds vicis argon oxygenated traditional competitors use velcro® or snap attachments to secure their jaw pads in an emergency situation calling for helmet removal the eﬀort to release these pads could place rotational pressure on the head our neurosurgeon advisors suggested we design our jaw pads diﬀerently allowing them to be removed with minimal rotational pressure as a result vicis jaw pads attach to the zero using cored titanium retention studs that can be fully released allowing the pads to be removed with straight and smooth motion the vicis zero configurator is optimized for modern browsers for the best experience please use the latest version of ie edge chrome firefox or safari if you have an older version of internet
