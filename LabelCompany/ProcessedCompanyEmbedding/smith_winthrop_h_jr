issues facing today’s global financial sector when excessive risk taking pushed the storied company into the hands of bank of america in  nobody was more heartbroken than win smith whose father—winthrop h smith sr—famously partnered with charlie merrill in the s to create a caring and collaborative corporate culture which introduced stock market investing to the masses and produced what was once the most respected and largest brokerage in the world in  after concluding pursuit of profits was trumping the traditional mother merrill leadership mentality smith resigned as the firm’s executive vicepresident and chairman of international operations he cut all financial ties to the company and left the industry choosing instead to acquire and run vermont’s sugarbush ski resort but an emotional bond to merrill lynch remained in this ivey interview smith talks about his new life as a professional ski bum not to mention his new book catching lightning in a bottle how merrill lynch revolutionized the financial world which was penned to honour the principled past of the firm his dad helped build on the th anniversary of its founding ivey your book describes how your father and charlie merrill joined forces to introduce investing to the masses seizing an opportunity generated by demand for war bonds this was really revolutionary right win smith indeed targeting main street using the retail chain strategy developed by my father and merrill was a new concept and it really altered the way average people managed wealth in that day and age most americans didn’t know how to invest in stocks and they didn’t trust wall street so there wasn’t really an opportunity to participate ivey the book isn’t just a history of merrill lynch you defend ethical financial professionals by pointing out the brokerage world was once dominated by a respected firm noting former sec chair arthur levitt once insisted merrill lynch was the only major financial institution with  “a soul” can you describe the mother merrill culture that you remember so fondly ws even before starting his own firm in  charlie merrill had a code of ethics that required clients’ interest to always come first he considered that to be a good way to add value as well as just good business after partnering with my father to launch the modern merrill lynch four additional basic principles were developed as a people business it was important to respect all concerned including employees to serve customers well everything had to be a team effort and because the company was targeting main street in america at first but eventually around the world it had to be part of the community participating in philanthropy and community associations etc and last but certainly not least the company had to operate with integrity as one former chairman put it if anyone was doing something that management couldn’t accept reading about in a newspaper then it shouldn’t be done those five principles came together in a caring culture that created a family atmosphere the company had high standards but employees had a sense of belonging that made them proud working for mother merrill ivey the culture you describe was largely gone by the last shareholder meeting which has been described as a funeral with everything that has happened in the sector do you think average folks will ever again believe integrity can be found inside the boardroom of financial institutions ws it can happen but it will take a lot of work the skepticism that exists today is obviously somewhat justified and just as deep as the skepticism the public had in the s the leaders of wall street are going to have to work very hard to restore trust and they can’t do it alone it has to be done at the grass roots level with every single financial sector employee working to regain client trust ivey despite the culture merrill lynch wasn’t immune to scandal during its heyday would you say the cultural difference was seen in how management responded to transgressions ws  absolutely no matter how good your compliance controls bad apples can be found in any company with thousands of employees some mistakes are unintentional and some are intentional either way how management reacts is what is important money can’t be the really important thing in these matters for example when merrill lynch underwrote annuities for a company called baldwinunited in the mids it had good intentions but due diligence wasn’t careful enough and a lot of clients ended up at risk roger birk chairman at the time made a very courageous and correct decision to essentially make those clients whole it cost a lot of money but it was the right thing to do i think that reflects how leadership of financial companies should react when mistakes happen ivey  you argue the culture was lost when the merrill lynch board allowed stan o’neal to operate in a way that would have made your father and charlie merrill sick what did previous leaders do differently that set them each apart from o’neal ws  they appreciated the firm’s history they didn’t have hubris they understood they were in the top position of a successful company because of steps taken by others before them they respected all five of the core principles and acted with total integrity ivey  the firm was obviously built via collaborative leadership along with an appreciation for healthy capitalization levels why do you think the board supported a more dictatorstyle of leadership and aggressive charge into risky products under o’neal ws  in my opinion the board concluded the firm was on the wrong course in  that it was not healthy and needed change the facts say different for the year  the company posted record earnings of us billion and a return on equity of  per cent it had us trillion in assets under management and had led the global league tables in debt underwriting for  consecutive months which was quite remarkable it was healthy and strong after the tech bubble burst and the events of  every firm needed to get rid of some fat  but stan o’neal convinced the board that much more needed to be done he cut into muscle and even some bone eliminating many businesses that had taken years of investment to build so when markets turned around many former growth engines were no longer there there was then a struggle to find a path to profitability and the easiest way was to leverage the balance sheet and jump into subprime mortgage products and other risky but highly profitable businesses at the time and then after getting intoxicated by the newfound profitability they got in deeper the leverage ratio reached  before that bubble burst ivey  was greed at work ws  well other firms like morgan stanley and goldman sachs were making better profits at the time and profits are obviously directly related to compensation on wall street it’s a very competitive environment and i think people at merrill lynch were convinced we had to have much higher earnings in order to generate the incentive compensation pools that were considered necessary i also think the form of compensation became less longterm when i was at the firm over half of my annual pay came in the form of restricted stock and stock options so i looked at the longterm a little bit differently than if i’d been paid strictly in bonus cash ivey  a flood of senior talent left or were sent packing under o’neal’s leadership why didn’t the board see this as an issue ws that is a perplexing question thousands of years of experience was forced out the door or chose not to stay and in some cases senior people were being walked out which wasn’t the mother merrill way directors shouldn’t micromanage so they are rightly hesitant about overriding the direction of the ceo but when you see a disturbing exodus of talent like what happened under o’neal it’s curious that nobody reached out to people they knew and asked them what was really going on ivey  was there a champion for the corporate culture on the board at the time  ws  i don’t believe there was the board had been turned over almost entirely ivey  so is one of the big takeaways here the need to have corporate culture championed at the board level not just within the rank and file ws  yes i really believe that’s true i think boards have an obligation to understand what the culture is let others know if they believe it is the right culture and if it is the right culture they have an obligation to make sure it is supported the most important role that all boards have is the selection of the ceo they must make sure that the leader has the requisite skills and character and the latter should include whether or not they actually buy into the organizational culture ivey charlie merrill and edmund lynch were very different individuals were fairness and honesty in business equally important to them  ws  from my research absolutely merrill lynch had a number of great coleaders over the years starting with charlie and eddie merrill was the visionary he was impulsive creative and charismatic lynch was more the governor on the ship he could calm charlie down and make him see reason when his ideas were foolish my father played a similar role my mother used to call him the glue that kept the firm together don regan and roger birk were a great pair partly because birk really knew how to work with someone who had an ego like regan he didn’t challenge regan publically but in private he could talk him out of bad decisions bill schreyer and dan tully were also a great team  so there were a lot of examples of coleaderships where two different types of skills come together to make a very effective team ivey  when charlie famously tried to raise the alarm about client exposure to frothy markets prior to the  crash he had an uphill battle convincing lynch and other executives to listen  do you think the mother merrill culture was truly in place at that time  ws  oh i think it was still very formative the company was only yearsold and it was still merging and defining itself but i think you often see character and ideas defined in a moment of crisis and charlie merrill’s steadfastness about selling in  even though he had serious selfdoubts which forced him to visit a psychiatrist set the example for the future ivey  do you think charlie just had a better vision of what was coming ws  yes i think he was a little bit more rooted in practicality which maybe came from his early days running a drug store for his father ivey so the conflict with lynch was really about differences of opinion over what was in the best interest of the client  ws yes bubbles always make some good people say the most dangerous words in investing which are “this time it is different” ivey describe your reaction when o’neal was allowed to retire with  million after the firm posted an billion quarterly loss  ws  i was sick to my stomach i felt absolute disgust if i had been near a tree i probably would have punched it it wasn’t just the money o’neal got i felt bad about selling all of my stocks when i left i didn’t have any personal exposure but i knew shareholders who trusted management were taking massive losses along with hardworking employees ranging from highlypaid executives to secretaries and margin clerks while this person walked away with  million it was totally shameful and irresponsible for the board to allow this to happen ivey  what would your dad have retired with  ws  oh in that day and age way way less to be fair it was a much smaller firm when my dad was in charge but his estate was only worth about  million when he passed away in  which of course was still a meaningful amount of money ivey  what are some other big lessons or takeaways from the fall of merrill lynch ws  boards have to understand the business even when it is complicated like at merrill lynch and if you look at the profile of directors there certainly were some people who should have understood leverage but i’m not sure anyone really understood the business well enough to ask about derivatives  so i think the importance of getting board composition right is a very important lesson we should learn from merrill lynch ivey your book offers a wide range of historical facts and interesting stories what’s the most interesting tale that you uncovered ws  well nothing was a total surprise because i knew much of the history but i’m always intrigued by the story of j edgar hoover coming to charlie merrill and my father and asking if they would hire an fbi agent and post him down in buenos aires to spy on the germans before the war  this agent employee became so enamored by the business that was his cover that he wanted to continue to work for merrill lynch in a real way after the war i don’t think anybody really knew if he ever left the spy game even when he became an actual employee of the firm  howard hughes is another interesting character in the firm’s history the story of how that visionary in aviation accumulated a fortune and then squandered it is an intriguing tale ivey  do you think mergers and growth weakened the culture at merrill lynch ws  uh huh  mergers are tricky for a firm with a unique culture in my book i noted the great success that followed the acquisition of smith new court which came about because of the attitude of the acquired executives who wanted to become part of the merrill lynch culture i contrast that a little bit with the mercury asset management merger in which the company retained its own name and really wanted to operate at arm’s length that was not nearly as successful as it could have been ivey  what would you have done if you had taken the ceo post in   ws  oh it’s so easy in hindsight to say what you would have done differently but i left was because i would not be party to what was happening so what i would have done is not cut nearly as drastically in the international business the relationship banking business and the us private client business  i would have suffered lower shortterm earnings but they would have been earnings not losses and that would have positioned the firm for a sustainable recovery i never would have allowed the firm to be levered the way it was and i never would have emphasized the subprime mortgages the way the firm did  it takes a strong leader to resist pressure and the market pressures on public companies today are enormous if you miss an estimate for a quarter you get hammered by investors that’s very difficult and it raises an issue about corporate governance people don’t like dual class shares but some of the companies that have dual shares have actually performed very well for the shareholder partly because they don’t face the same pressure from shareholders ivey  was there really no feeling of privilege in earlier times   ws my father carpooled in my day executive vicepresidents had a car and driver but all of us felt very comfortable being with anybody at merrill lynch there wasn’t a hierarchy that demanded a personal elevator for the ceo or required interns to avoid eye contact with executives ivey  a lot of things have changed since main street was introduced to wall street do you ever think that maybe main street should keep its distance ws  no i don’t i think that longterm equities offer a very good opportunity for people and i think you really cannot be a shortterm trader that is very difficult and very risky as warren buffett says if you invest in the right people at the right companies and stick with it you don’t have to watch the ticker tape that’s why i don’t think that the trusted advisor is ever going to go away the model works and there are many good financial advisors at big firms and in boutiques in canada i am a director of richardson gmp which in many ways has the same principles and values that built merrill lynch ivey  in your book you describe how tough many of the firm’s early executives had it when starting out which helped develop their leadership character do you think merrill’s modest means his need to play baseball and sell newspapers for money contributed to his respect for main street and are you concerned about the relatively easy career path of many financial sector executives today ws  i haven’t really thought about it  but now that you’ve asked the question i think there is a good point there humility is an awfully good trait and i think the fact that the early people at merrill lynch had to share rides and apartments did keep them humble and in touch with average people partnership discipline also played a role partners at brokerages even in the s typically took a very very modest annual draw it was only at the end of their career that they recognized real wealth there wasn’t the same schism that we are seeing in society today where the wealthy are seen as vultures as opposed to people that can help everybody else build jobs and grow the economy some of that is brought on by the excesses that people are seeing but lack of humility is an issue ivey  you now describe yourself as a ski bum who runs a resort in vermont right ws  yes it’s not a bad second career ivey  are there similarities between mother merrill and how you run sugarbush  ws  there are it’s obviously a very different business but i’ve actually adopted the five principles i learned at merrill lynch we really try to put guest interests first we have a thousand employees many are just seasonal and they all have to feel respected to provide good service they have to operate as a team and i’m the big employer in a small valley so i feel an obligation to be part of the community  i tell everybody the same thing about integrity if it’s raining my employees know they have to tell people looking to ski with us that it is raining that’s what integrity is all about ivey  do you ever think about getting a group together and launching a new financial sector company based upon the principles  ws  i loved every minute of the  years i was at merrill lynch except for the last it’s hard to go back and i don’t think i could ever emotionally compete against merrill lynch even though it’s a different firm under bank of america ownership today especially since i have two nephews and a soninlaw working there and doing very well i have kept my toe in the water by being on the boards of four financial institutions so i’m intellectually engaged i’m involved it’s fun and i think i am making a difference but that’s the most i want to do right now i really enjoy running sugarbush related contentby thomas watsonthe ivey interview steinthór pálssonby thomas watsonthe ivey interview george copeby gerard seijts thomas

venture capital legalregulatory one view of merrill lynch’s fall by landon thomas jr february    am february    am photowinthrop h smith jr the son of one of the founding partners of merrill lynch has written a book about the firmcredit in late  winthrop h smith jr a senior merrill lynch executive and son of one of the firm’s founding partners walked into the office of his justappointed boss e stanley o’neal ready to accept a new job he was being offered mr smith had just been removed from his position as chairman of merrill lynch international and head of firm’s brokers outside the united states and mr o’neal was asking him to serve as a banker to the firm’s biggest clients globally it was a nice perch but a bit of a comedown compared with his last job so before he said yes mr smith who has long seen himself as a guardian of the firm’s cultural mores asked mr o’neal whether he would remain true to merrill’s principles of teamwork integrity and client focus “as soon as i asked the question he launched into a diatribe about all that was wrong with ‘mother merrill’ and how we had to raise our standards and get rid of all the incompetent people who had been kept around we’ve got to get rid of nepotism” as mr smith would go on to explain in “catching lightning in a bottle” his selfpublished and deeply personal history of the rise and fall of merrill lynch he would refuse the job thus ending a year career at the firm if mr o’neal had held true to the principles that were put in place by mr smith’s father and subsequent merrill leaders mr smith argues then the firm would never have become so exposed to the risky mortgages that forced it into a shotgun merger with bank of america in  this is the framework that mr smith uses to tell his story and the flame of his anger for mr o’neal holds true and steady from the beginning of the book to its end — a photo collage of all merrill’s chief executives in which mr o’neal stands starkly apart the anecdote is a delicious one and there are many more in this quite readable book the result perhaps when a wall street insider tells all but what makes the story especially revealing is what it says about these two men — more or less equal in age but polar opposites in every other respect — and it highlights the divide between merrill’s old guard and new that would lead to the end of its centurylong run as an independent company by alienating merrill’s leading culture carrier at a time when he was making radical changes throughout the company mr o’neal helped give voice to all those who opposed his reforms as for mr smith who was not overseeing a large profit center at the bank at the time the idea that he would administer a litmus test to the firm’s next chief executive seems fairly ambitious at best at the time of the encounter mr o’neal was president of merrill he would not be chief executive until  becoming the first black man to lead a major wall street firm to be sure mr smith is not the first person — inside the firm and out — to point a finger at mr o’neal under his reign thousands of executives senior and junior would lose their jobs and mr o’neal’s headlong plunge into subprime mortgages resulted in the steepest losses in the firm’s history mr smith also criticizes mr o’neal for cutting a deal with prosecutors over the firm’s dealings with enron a move that resulted in merrill bankers going to jail on charges that were eventually dropped photoe stanley oneal the former chief executive of merrill lynch  in credit doug millsthe new york times but mr smith’s fervent belief that merrill under a different chieftain would not have joined the race to emulate goldman sachs by jumping into all sorts of profitable but highrisk trading areas is open to question indeed even mr o’neal’s defenders recognize that the mortgage bet was a disaster although they point out that except for jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs pretty much every big firm on the street either died or had a neardeath experience “it is clear that merrill’s management along with the rest of industry called the mortgage market wrong and no one has been tougher on themselves than stan” said jason h wright a top adviser to mr o’neal at merrill but mr wright disputes the view that mr o’neal’s move to change the culture of the firm by promoting a new vanguard of leaders resulted in the firm’s demise “to the extent that mother merrill emphasized a sense of community stan was for it” he said “but to the extent that emphasized a sense of paternalism and a club of insiders who ran the show — that stan felt was in need of updating” the book should not be read as an objective history in fact the stories that mr smith tells about the firm’s early days and the extraordinary insights and vision that the early partners had in bringing stocks and bonds to main street resonate all the more in light of his own familial ties but when it comes to merrill’s implosion the book could have benefited from some more perspective from those running the show at the time indeed all the criticism of mr o’neal — from excessive use of the company helicopter to excessive golf — becomes a bit repetitive after awhile reached briefly by phone mr o’neal declined to comment indeed outside of a single magazine article several years ago has has said little nor does he seen to be doing much these days outside of serving on the board of alcoa but rumors still abound that he may tell his own story about how the grandson of an alabama slave ascended one of wall street’s highest peaks only to tumble down from it shortly thereafter if so it would be a fitting companion to mr smith’s work whats next loading previous post mallinckrodt to buy san diego biopharmaceutical firm for  billion next post charter’s bid for a
