sales price or if no such price exists at the closing bid price thereof security cost  the original cost to the trust of the securities was based for securities listed on a national securities exchange on the closing sale prices on the exchange or the closing asked prices if not listed the cost was determined on the day of the various dates of deposit unit valuation  the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit based upon  the cash on hand in the trust or monies in the process of being collected  the securities in the trust based on the value as described in note  and  accumulated dividends thereon less accrued expenses of the trust if any federal income taxes  each unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the trust and accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes other  the financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis new accounting pronouncements  on december   the american institute of certified public accountants issued a new audit and accounting guide for investment companies the revised guide codifies new accounting standards on several issues including amortization of premium or discount on debt securities and accounting for offering costs changes required by the guide are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   amortization of premium or discount on debt securities will result in a reclassification of amounts previously recognized in unrealized gains or losses to net investment income trusts with unamortized offering costs are to apply the provisions relating to offering costs as a cumulative effect of the change charged or credited directly to net asset value to unitholders the trustee and the sponsor believe that the adoption of the provisions in the guide will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the trust note   portfolio unrealized appreciation and depreciation  an analysis of net unrealized appreciation depreciation at october   is as follows unrealized appreciation   unrealized depreciation      note  other marketability  although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and to continuously offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the value of the securities in the portfolio of the trust valued as described in note  plus accumulated dividends to the date of settlement if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices in the event that a market is not maintained for the units a unitholder desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on adding to the underlying value of the securities per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus an amount equal to the difference between the maximum sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate underlying value of the securities  on december   the secondary sales will be  compensation of evaluator and supervisor  the supervisor receives a fee for providing

by part one this prospectus is dated as of the date of the preospectus part i accompanying this prospectus part ii the securities and exchange commission has not approved or disapproved of the units

indenture and trust agreement the trust agreement dated the initial date of deposit among van kampen funds inc as sponsor van kampen investment advisory corp as supervisor the bank of new york as trustee and for certain trusts as evaluator or their predecessors effective april   american portfolio evaluation services a division of van kampen investment advisory corp resigned as evaluator and the bank of new york was appointed successor evaluator trusts created after this time do not have a separate evaluator the bank of new york performs evaluation services for these trusts in its role as trustee the trust offers investors the opportunity to purchase units representing proportionate interests in a portfolio of actively traded equity securities the trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of stocks with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually on the initial date of deposit the sponsor deposited delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of the securities and an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the trustee in exchange for these contracts the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust unless otherwise terminated as provided in the trust agreement the trust will terminate on the mandatory termination date and any remaining securities will be liquidated or distributed by the trustee within a reasonable time as used in this prospectus the term securities means the securities including contracts to purchase these securities listed in portfolio in part one for the trust and any additional securities deposited into the trust additional units of the trust may be issued at any time by depositing in the trust i additional securities ii contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or iii cash or a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by the trust the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the trust following the initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the trusts portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees each unit of the trust initially offered represents an undivided interest in the trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement the trust consists of a the securities including contracts for the purchase thereof listed under the portfolio in part one as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the related income and capital accounts neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities objectives and securities selection the trust invests in a portfolio of stocks selected using concepts outlined in the roaring s written by harry s dent jr the trust seeks to increase the value of your investment over its life the roaring s is the third book written by harry s dent jr analyzing economic technological and demographic trends in society we designed the trust to take advantage of the insights philosophies and strategies discussed in this book based on mr dents current analysis the portfolio focuses on stocks from four sectors technology financials health care and usbased multinationals the trust seeks to leverage demographic economic and lifestyle trends that may develop over the next  years according to mr dent some significant changes that may potentially impact the future economy include o aging baby boomers reaching their peak spending years o internet usage and new technologies becoming more mainstream o a shift in the business and organizational structure brought on by the information age o rising importance of small to mediumsized high growth companies o growth opportunities from continued global economic development mr dent believes that the coming years may bring an era of economic prosperity and lifestyle changes for instance mr dent believes that the internet may be as important a catalyst for change in business as the assemblyline once was for production mr dent applies the principle of the scurve in analyzing technologies and social trends in the economy this concept shows how products move into mainstream acceptance the scurve shows how products develop in three stages over time innovation growth and maturity mr dent also focuses on the spending wave this analysis illustrates how our economy has correlated closely with birth rates over time the level of births lagged for peak in family spending has almost paralleled the dow jones industrial average adjusted for inflation of course we cannot guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the value of your units may fall below the price you paid for the units you should read the risk factors section before you invest using extensive research developed from years of handson business experience mr dent seeks to offer a positive and understandable view of trends in society he proposes practical applications at all levels from personal investments to business strategies to jobs and changes in the workplace to growth areas for real estate mr dent received his mba from harvard business school where he was a baker scholar he graduated number one in his class at the university of south carolina with a degree in accounting and finance mr dent has worked as a consultant with several fortune  companies to develop and innovate competitive business strategies he has been ceo of several growth companies and has acted as consultant to several leading edge companies mr dent is the author of the  book the great boom ahead revised in  his second book job shock four new principles transforming our work and business was published in  and then rereleased in  as the great jobs ahead the roaring s updates key principles of these books and focuses on the internets rapid move into the mainstream and how our work organizations and living circumstances may change mr dent also publishes the hs dent forecast newsletter since  he has been speaking to executives around the world he has appeared on good morning america pbs cnbc the business channel and has been featured in fortune success the wall street journal and omni the sponsor selected the portfolio based on concepts presented in the roaring s and research compiled by mr dent mr dent did not select the stocks for the portfolio does not endorse the trust and will not supervise the portfolio the opinions and forecasts of mr dent expressed in his books and elsewhere are not necessarily those of van kampen funds inc and may not actually come to pass mr dent is being compensated by the sponsor for his research the roaring ssm is the exclusive property of the hs dent foundation the roaring ssm is a service mark of the hs dent foundation the trust has licensed the use of this service mark from the hs dent foundation harry s dent jr has not participated in any way in the creation of the trust or in the selection of stocks included in the trust and has not approved any information herein relating thereto investors should note that the above criteria were applied to the securities for inclusion in the trust as of the initial date of deposit subsequent to this date the securities may no longer meet the above criteria should a security no longer meet the selection criteria the security will not as a result thereof be removed from the trust portfolio risk factors price volatility the trust invests in stocks the value of units will fluctuate with the value of these stocks and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units the market value of stocks sometimes moves up or down rapidly and unpredictably because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time dividends stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time financial services industry the trust invests significantly in financial institutions any negative impact on this industry may have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the recently enacted grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in the investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property and casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes technology issuers the trust is concentrated in issuers within the technology industry a portfolio concentrated in a single industry may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several industries the trust and therefore unitholders may be particularly susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries accordingly an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the technology industry and the risks which such an investment may entail technology companies generally include companies involved in the development design manufacture and sale of computers computer related equipment computer networks communications systems telecommunications products electronic products and other related products systems and services the market for technology products and services especially those specifically related to the internet is characterized by rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions the success of the issuers of the securities depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuers products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuers operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities will be able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace the market for certain technology products and services may have only recently begun to develop is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants additionally certain technology companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the public such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited operating history on which to analyze future operating results it is important to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading accordingly there can be no assurance that upon redemption of units or termination of the trust a unitholder will receive an amount greater than or equal to the unitholders initial investment based on trading history factors such as announcements of new products or development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to fluctuate substantially in addition technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of the securities and therefore the ability of a unitholder to redeem units or roll over units into a new trust at a price equal to or greater than the original price paid for such units some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently available only from single sources there can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner accordingly an issuers operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for or and interruption or reduction in supply of any key components additionally many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales because many products and technologies are incorporated into other related products certain companies are often highly dependent on the performance of other computer electronics and communications companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders form other customers similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities health care issuers an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry in general healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans the sponsor is unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency public offering general units are

accordingly this public offering price will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day the evaluation time is the close of the new york stock exchange on each trust business day orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day which is not a business day will be held until the next determination

also excludes any day on which more than  of the securities are not traded on their principal trading exchange due to a customary business holiday on that exchange the aggregate underlying value of the securities during the initial offering period is determined on each business day by the evaluator or trustee as applicable in the following manner if the securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market inc this evaluation is generally based on the closing sale prices on that exchange or market unless it is determined that these prices are

investment portfolio incorporates various style and market capitalization characteristics we offer unit trusts with a variety of styles and capitalizations to meet your needs a trust is not a balanced investment portfolio itself and should not be your only investment from time to time in advertising and sales materials we may utilize investment style and market capitalization categories to assist in determining the investment category that a trust might fill within an investors overall investment portfolio investors should note that investment style and market capitalization are not used in selecting the stocks for a trust we determine the style characteristics growth or value based on the types of stocks in a trust generally a growth portfolio includes companies in a growth phase of their business with increasing earnings a value portfolio generally includes companies with low relative priceearnings ratios that we believe are undervalued we generally determine the market capitalization based on the weighted median market capitalization of a trust investment style and capitalization characteristics will vary over time we will not remove a security from a trust as a result of any change in characteristics taxation the following is a general discussion of certain of the federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the units of the trust the summary is limited to investors who hold the units as capital assets generally property held for investment within the meaning of section  of the internal revenue code of  the code unitholders should consult their tax advisers in determining the federal state local and any other tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of units in the trust for purposes of the following discussion and opinion it is assumed that each security in the trust is equity for federal income tax purposes in the opinion of chapman and cutler special counsel for the sponsor under existing law  your trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes each unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the assets of the trust under the code and the income of the trust will be treated as income of the unitholders thereof under the code each unitholder will be considered to have received his pro rata share of income derived from each security when such income is considered to be received by the trust  each unitholder will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a security whether by sale exchange liquidation redemption or otherwise or upon the sale or redemption of units by such unitholder except to the extent an in kind distribution of stock is received by such unitholder as described below the price a unitholder pays for his units generally including sales charges is allocated among his pro rata portion of each security held by the trust in proportion to the fair market values thereof on the valuation date nearest the date the unitholder purchase his units in order to determine his initial tax basis for his pro rata portion of each security held by the trust unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to calculation of basis for federal income tax purposes a unitholders pro rata portion of dividends as defined by section  of the code paid by a corporation with respect to a security held by the trust are taxable as ordinary income to the extent of such corporations current and accumulated earnings and profits a unitholders pro rata portion of dividends paid on such security which exceeds such current and accumulated earnings and profits will first reduce a unitholders tax basis in such security and to the extent that such dividends exceed a unitholders tax basis in such security shall generally be treated as capital gain in general the holding period for such capital gain will be determined by the period of time a unitholder has held his units  a unitholders portion of gain if any upon the sale or redemption of units or the disposition of securities held by the trust will generally be considered a capital gain except in the case of a dealer or a financial institution a unitholders portion of loss if any upon the sale or redemption of units or the disposition of securities held by the trust will generally be considered a capital loss except in the case of a dealer or a financial institution unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the recognition of such capital gains and losses for federal income tax purposes dividends received deduction a unitholder will be considered to have received all of the dividends paid on his pro rata portion of each security when such dividends are received by the trust unitholders will be taxed in this manner regardless of whether distributions from the trust are actually received by the unitholder or are automatically reinvested a corporation that owns units will generally be entitled to a  dividends received deduction with respect to such unitholders pro rata portion of dividends received by the trust to the extent such dividends are taxable as ordinary income as discussed above and are attributable to domestic corporations in the same manner as if such corporation directly owned the securities paying such dividends other than corporate unitholders such as s corporations which are not eligible for the deduction because of their special characteristics and other than for purposes of special taxes such as the accumulated earnings tax and the personal holding corporation tax however a corporation owning units should be aware that sections  and a of the code impose additional limitations on the eligibility of dividends for the  dividends received deduction these limitations include a requirement that stock and therefore units must generally be held at least  days as determined under section c of the code final regulations have been issued which address special rules that must be considered in determining whether the  day holding requirement is met moreover the allowable percentage of the deduction will be reduced from  if a corporate unitholder owns certain stock or units the financing of which is directly attributable to indebtedness incurred by such corporation to the extent dividends received by the trust are attributable to foreign corporations a corporation that owns units will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to its pro rata portion of such dividends since the dividends received deduction is generally available only with respect to dividends paid by domestic corporations unitholders should consult with their tax advisers with respect to the limitations on and possible modifications to the dividends received deduction limitations on deductibility of trust expenses by unitholders each unitholders pro rata share of each expense paid by the trust is deductible by the unitholder to the same extent as though the expense had been paid directly by him as a result of the tax reform act of  certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses tax return preparation fees and employee business expenses will be deductible by an individual only to the extent they exceed  of such individuals adjusted gross income unitholders may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to this limitation unitholders should consult with their own tax advisers regarding the deductibility of trust expenses recognition of taxable gain or loss upon disposition of securities by the trust or disposition of units as discussed above a unitholder may recognize taxable gain or loss when a security is disposed of by the trust or if the unitholder disposes of a unit the internal revenue service restructing and reform act of  the  tax act provides that for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gain which is defined as net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year realized from property with certain exclusions is subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate of   in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less the date on which a unit is acquired ie the trade date is excluded for purposes of determining the holding period of the unit capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income for tax years beginning after december   the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm gains from most property the holding period of which is more than five years due to the length of the trusts life the reduction in the capital gains rate for property held for more than five years could only possibly apply to your interest in the securities if you are eligible for and elect to receive an in kind distribution at redemption or termination in addition please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are considered conversion transactions effective for transactions entered into after april   unitholders and prospective investors should consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this provision on their investment in units if a unitholder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the trust including his pro rata portion of all securities represented by a unit the taxpayer relief act of  the  tax act includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain eg short sales offsetting notional principal contracts futures or forward contracts or similar transactions as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not of loss and for purposes of determining the holding period unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to any such constructive sales rules special tax consequences of in kind distributions upon redemption of units or termination of the trust as discussed in rights of unitholdersredemption of units under certain circumstances a unitholder tendering units for redemption may request an in kind distribution a unitholder may also under certain circumstances request an in kind distribution upon the termination of the trust see rights of unitholdersredemption of units as previously discussed prior to the redemption of units or the termination of the trust a unitholder is considered as owning a pro rata portion of each of the trusts assets for federal income tax purposes the receipt of an in kind distribution will result in a unitholder receiving whole shares of stock plus possibly cash the potential tax consequences that may occur under an in kind distribution with respect to each security held by the trust will depend on whether or not a unitholder receives cash in addition to securities a security for this purpose is a particular class of stock issued by a particular corporation a unitholder will not recognize gain or loss if a unitholder only receives securities in exchange for his or her pro rata portion in the securities held by the trust  however if a unitholder also receives cash in exchange for a fractional share of such security held by the trust such unitholder will generally recognize gain or loss based upon the difference between the amount of cash received by the unitholder and his tax basis in such fractional share of a security held by the trust because the trust will own many securities a unitholder who requests an in kind distribution will have to analyze the tax consequences with respect to each security owned by the trust the amount of taxable gain or loss recognized upon such exchange will generally equal the sum of the gain or loss recognized under the rules described above by such unitholder with respect to each security owned by the trust unitholders who request an in kind distribution are advised to consult their tax advisers in this regard computation of the unitholders tax basis initially a unitholders tax basis in his units will generally equal the price paid by such unitholder of his units the cost of the units is allocated among the securities held in the trust in accordance with the proportion of the fair market values of such securities on the valuation date nearest the date the units are purchased in order to determine such unitholders tax basis for his pro rata portion of each security a unitholders tax basis in his units and his pro rata portion of a security held by the trust will be reduced to the extent dividends paid with respect to such security are received by the trust which are not taxable as ordinary income as described above other matters each unitholder will be requested to provide the unitholders taxpayer identification number to the trustee and to certify that the unitholder has not been notified that payments to the unitholder are subject to backup withholding if the proper taxpayer identification number and appropriate certification are not provided when requested distributions by the trust to such unitholder including amounts received upon the redemption of units will be subject to backup withholding distributions by the trust other than those that are not treated as united states source income if any will generally be subject to united states income taxation and withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations or other nonunited states persons such persons should consult their tax advisers in general income that is not effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business within the united states that is earned by nonus unitholders and derived from dividends of foreign corporations will not be subject to us withholding tax provided that less than  percent of the gross income of the foreign corporations for a threeyear period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding payment was effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business within the united states in addition such earnings may be exempt from us withholding pursuant to a specific treaty between the united states and a foreign country nonus unitholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the imposition of us withholding on distributions from the trust it should be noted that payments to the trust of dividends on securities that are attributable to foreign corporations may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential tax consequences relating to the payment of any such withholding taxes by the trust any dividends withheld as a result thereof will nevertheless be treated as income to the unitholders because under the grantor trust rules an investor is deemed to have paid directly his share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued if any an investor may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for united states tax purposes with respect to such taxes the  tax act imposes a required holding period for such credits investors should consult their tax advisers with respect to foreign withholding taxes and foreign tax credits at the termination of the trust the trustee will furnish to each unitholder of the trust a statement containing information relating to the dividends received by the trust on the securities the gross proceeds received

common stocks of us and foreign companies you should understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of common stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in your trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of your trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because your trust holds a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company accordingly common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock foreign stocks because your trust invests in foreign common stocks they involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that are published about issuers in the united states also foreign issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to united states issuers with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of your trust political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect united states investments in those countries moreover industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in terms of growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the united states while growing in volume they usually have substantially less volume than the new york stock exchange and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable united states issuers fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on united states exchanges there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed issuers than in the united states foreign currencies your trust also involves the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the stocks for example if a foreign stock rose  in price but the us dollar gained  against the related foreign currency a us investors return would be reduced to about  this is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or conversely a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the us dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency investor perceptions of world or country economies political instability currency speculation by institutional investors changes in government policies buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries trade balances and changes in interest rates your trusts foreign currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot ie cash buying basis these dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency bid price and the price at which they sell the currency offer price the trustee will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency exchange markets however due to the volatility of the markets and other factors the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate your trust might obtain had the trustee sold the currency in the market at that time financial services issuers an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin recently bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted but volume gains have been strong in both commercial and consumer products there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the recently enacted grammleachbliley financialservices overhaul legislation will allow banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor the underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor the underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversley affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estmating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state leglislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture technology issuers your trust invests significantly in issuers within the technology industry a portfolio concentrated in a single industry may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several industries the trust and therefore unitholders may be particularly susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries accordingly an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the technology industry and the risks which such an investment may entail technology companies generally include companies involved in the development design manufacture and sale of computers computer related equipment computer networks communications systems telecommunications products electronic products and other related products systems and services the market for technology products and services especially those specifically related to the internet is characterized by rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions the success of the issuers of the securities depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuers products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuers operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities will be able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace the market for certain technology products and services may have only recently begun to develop is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants additionally certain technology companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the public such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited operating history on which to analyze future operating results it is important to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading accordingly there can be no assurance that upon redemption of units or termination of your trust a unitholder will receive an amount greater than or equal to the unitholders initial investment based on trading history factors such as announcements of new products or development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to fluctuate substantially in addition technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of the securities and therefore the ability of a unitholder to redeem units or roll over units into a new trust at a price equal to or greater than the original price paid for such units some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently available only from single sources there can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner accordingly an issuers operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for or and interruption or reduction in supply of any key components additionally many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales because many products and technologies are incorporated into other related products certain companies are often highly dependent on the performance of other computer electronics and communications companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders form other customers similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities health care issuers an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry in general healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans the sponsor is unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust liquidity whether or not the stocks in the trust are listed on a stock exchange the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks we cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid the value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent additional units the sponsor may create additional units of the trust by depositing into the trust additional stocks or cash with instructions to purchase additional stocks a cash deposit could result in a dilution of your investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and because the trust will pay brokerage fees voting only the trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the trust while you may sell or redeem your units you may not sell or vote the stocks in your trust the sponsor will instruct the trustee how to vote the stocks the trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the sponsor fails to provide instructions the trust harry s dent jr believes that the economy may be on the edge of economic change that may change how people communicate and fundamentally alter how and where people live and work at the same time mr dent believes the baby boom generation will reach its peak earning spending and productivity years mr dent believes that the convergence of these two events could spark the trends of the years ahead the trust was designed to benefit from the insights philosophies and strategies found in the book the roaring s by harry s dent jr family spending cycles of each new generation of consumers and workers drive the economy birth rates because they show how many people are in a generation may be a leading indicator of the economy as a generation develops and moves into its peak family spending cycle the economy may rise to account for the number of people at their peak spending age at a given time mr dent lags the birth index forward  years the average person historically hits their peak spending at approximately  years of age after consideration of this lag the birth index and the dow jones industrial average adjusted for inflation have exhibited a close correlation in the past mr dent believes that this spending wave may enable a connection to be made helping to forecast the economy in the future of course past performance is no guarantee of future results based on the cycles discussed previously mr dent has identified various sectors of our economy that may be primed for growth potential the trust seeks to capitalize on trends impacting four main sectors including o technology  new technologies may be shaping new standards in the way people work and live businesses may be beginning to prepare for downshifts in the labor force by investing in labor saving technology that could improve productivity and lower costs o financial services  the baby boomers may be forced to become investors and therefore may need to seek financial advice additionally choices for investing are numerous and complicated as our economy grows so may additional opportunities for investment vehicles o health care  as the baby boomers age health care may become increasingly important as needs statistically begin to rise as people age they tend to spend more of their income on health care costs as technologies increase americans may find more options and choices in this sector than ever before o us multinational companies  a global marketplace is emerging and many usbased companies appear to be experiencing new sales growth through the elimination of geographical barriers that once inhibited sales now through technology increases multinational companies may be emerging as market leaders internationally as well as domestically the sponsor

selection the objective of a longterm trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of longterm bonds the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a either the standard  poors rating of the bonds was not less than bbb or the moodys investors service inc moodys rating of the bonds was not less than baa including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and d with respect to the insured trusts the availability and cost of insurance after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in an investment grade trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in an insured trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust neither the public offering price nor any evaluation of units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by an insured trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringoffering price in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the standard  poors rating of bbb or at least the moodys investors service inc rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancellable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by a trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by an insured trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by standard  poors standard  poors describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the sales charge for an intermediateterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds and the sales charge for a longterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit in connection with fully disclosed transactions with the sponsor the minimum purchase is the number of units stated in the contract between the sponsor and the related broker or agent the sales charge applicable to quantity purchases during the initial offering period is reduced as follows dollar amount of sales aggregate charge reduction per unit number of intermediateterm longterm units purchased trusts trusts     units      units    units    or more units     the breakpoint sales charges are also applied on a dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent in the above table of  per unit and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the investor the breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole units be issued the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life of your trusts portfolio years to maturity sales charge                                            to   for purposes of computation of the estimated longterm return life bonds will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless a the bonds have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call date in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date or b the bonds are subject to a mandatory tender in which case the mandatory tender will be deemed to be the maturity date the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds expressed as a percent of the public offering price the sales charge on a trust consisting entirely of bonds with  years to maturity would be  any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling underwriter broker dealer or agent the sponsor will however increase the concession or agency commission for quantity purchases the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases during the initial offering period table above will apply on all purchases by the same person from any one underwriter or dealer of units of van kampen unit investment trusts which are being offered in the initial offering period a on any one day the initial purchase date or b on any day subsequent to the initial purchase date if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust purchased on the initial purchase date in the event units of more than one trust are purchased on the initial purchase date the aggregate dollar amount of such purchases will be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a reduced sales charge such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public offering price per unit on the day preceding the date of purchase of each respective trust purchased to determine the total number of units which such amount could have purchased of each individual trust purchasers must then consult the applicable trusts prospectus to determine whether the total number of units which could have been purchased of a specific trust would have qualified for a reduced sales charge and if so qualified the amount of such reduction assuming a purchaser qualifies for a sales charge reduction or reductions to determine the applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it is necessary to accumulate all purchases made on the initial purchase date and all purchases made in accordance with b above units purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser immediate family members will be deemed for the purposes of

this program will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases offering price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly this public offering price will be effective for all orders received at or prior to the evaluation time on each such day the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading orders received by the trustee sponsor or any underwriter for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest

initially deposited in a trust except for the substitution of certain refunding bonds the trustee will notify unitholders of any amendment termination of trust agreement a trust will terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the trust a trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of unitholders of  of the units then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of the trust is less than  of the original principal amount of bonds the trustee will notify each unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining bonds the sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per unit or value at the time of purchase the trustee will distribute to each unitholder his share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts after deduction of costs expenses or indemnities the unitholder will receive a final distribution statement with this distribution when the trustee in its sole discretion determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it will distribute these amounts to unitholders the information supplement contains further information regarding termination of a trust see additional information limitation on liabilities the sponsor supervisor evaluator and trustee shall be under no liability to unitholders for taking any action or

section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state or foreign taxes as with any investment you should consult your own tax professional about your particular consequences in addition the internal revenue service issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective january   foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of these regulations assets of a trust each trust will hold various debt obligations the debt obligations all of the assets held by a trust constitute the trust assets for purposes of this federal tax discussion it is assumed that the debt obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes trust status a trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of your trust and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and capital gains if any from the trust assets when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically reinvested into additional units in addition the income from the trust assets which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay trust expenses including the deferred sales charge if any your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units generally including sales charges among each trust asset ratably according to their value on the date you purchase your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period of your units the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations discount accrued interest and premium on debt obligations some debt obligations may have been sold with original issue discount this generally means that the debt obligations were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes your basis of each debt obligation which was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the debt obligation over the purchase price of the debt obligation market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for a debt obligation or on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the debt obligation when the debt obligation is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions stripped us treasury obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules rather than being treated as having market discount alternatively some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any debt obligation generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you may elect to amortize premium if you make this election you may reduce your interest income received on the debt obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax basis will be reduced if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a debt obligation you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that debt obligation when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the debt obligation this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of debt obligations that were issued with original issue discount exchanges if you elect to reinvest amounts received from a trust into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of a future trust will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may however be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign state and local taxes some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any interest withheld will nevertheless be treated as income to you however because you are deemed to have paid directly your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your trust you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for us tax purposes with respect to such taxes if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you will not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some of the income from your trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes in the opinion of special counsel to the trusts for new york tax matters the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the trusts will be treated as the income of the unitholders under the existing income tax laws of the state and city of new york expenses  general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the trusts amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts all costs and expenses incurred in creating and establishing the trusts including the cost of the initial preparation printing and execution of the trust agreement and the

noninterest bearing to unitholders these fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and units on the date of deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on january  for each year thereafter insurance premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an insured trust and are payable monthly by the trustee on behalf of the trust as bonds covered by a portfolio

risks associated with such bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds in an insured trust insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in each insured trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior the deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus each insurance policy obtained by an insured trust is noncancellable and will continue in force so long as such insured trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such insured trust see portfolio for the trust in the prospectus part i nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such insured trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an insured trust are fixed for the life of an insured trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from an insured trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such insured trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise an insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basisthe insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by an insured trust insurance policy may be sold out of the insured trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the insured trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the insured trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in the prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if the insured trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the insured trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the insured trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in the prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bond not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default ambac assurance corporation ambac assurance effective july   ambac indemnity corporation changed its name to ambac assurance

insured trust a monthly premium is paid by an insured trust for the insurance policy obtained by it the trustee will pay when due successively the full amount of each installment of the insurance premium pursuant to a binding agreement with ambac assurance in the event of a sale of a bond covered by the ambac assurance insurance policy the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance

assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond this assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price the ratings are based on current information furnished to standard  poors by the issuer and obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the bond in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt bond and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest aabonds rated aa also qualify as highquality debt obligations capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong and in the majority of instances they differ from aaa issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories plus  or minus  to provide more detailed indications of credit quality the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings a provisional rating p assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion accordingly the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk moodys investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances the safety of obligations of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities these aa bonds are high grade their market value virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances during a sustained period of depressed business conditions during periods of normalcy bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks at the high end of its category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category conbonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operating experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition estimated cash flows to unitholders the tables below set forth the per unit estimated monthly and semiannual distributions of interest and principal to unitholders

map as of  key stats weighted avg pe   weighted avg pb   weighted avg market cap mm   each key stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself the portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next distribution date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus  the estimated annual income per unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trusts initial offering period and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter this amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends the actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends and distributions received currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities the actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trusts life  the portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the unitholders basis in the units and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors as of the close of business day prior to initial date of deposit the actual distributions you may receive will vary from the

liquidation of securities the trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above important information about benchmarks about risk there is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trusts life except in limited circumstances accordingly you can lose money investing in this trustthe trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials energy financial services healthcare consumer staples and utility industries negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investmentan issuer of securities held by the trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared
