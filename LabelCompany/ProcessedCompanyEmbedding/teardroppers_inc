with this registration statement and prospectus we are a small independent startup mobile billboard advertising company that commenced mobile billboard operations in february of  we will face competition from other mobile billboard advertising companies specifically and generally from all other advertising and media companies most if not all of our competitors are much larger well established and better financed companies in addition there is no barrier to entry for other adverting companies should they decide to offer advertising on their own teardrop trailers we do not consider us to be a factor in our industry and there is no assurance that we will be successful in selling advertising services or even if successful in obtaining paying advertisers that we will be profitable there are currently many manufacturers of teardrop trailers that offer their products to the marketplace while we believe the plans we have provides us with the ability to assemble trailers at an advantageous price we do not believe that the plans provide us protection against potential competitors entering our intended business company description the teardroppers inc is a nevada corporation which was formed in june of  mobile billboard advertising we intend to enter the business of mobile billboard advertising by offering to provide billboard advertising space on custom designed teardrop trailers teardrop trailers are usually designed for shortperiod accommodations for vacationers and travelers teardrop trailers are designed to be towed behind small economy sized vehicles and pickup trucks a teardrop trailer also known as a teardrop camper trailer is a streamlined compact lightweight travel trailer which gets its name from its teardrop profile we have ordered the assembly of one teardrop trailer from an independent partnership the partnership based upon teardrop trailer designs provided by the partnership and approved by us this teardrop trailer is expected to be delivered by january   in addition we ordered a kit from the partnership along with a custom chassis from an independent supplier recommended by the partnership which enables us to assemble our first teardrop trailer the teardrop trailer assembled from this kit is currently being assembled by an independent contractor and is expected to delivered to us on december   due to manufacturing limitations of the partnership we determined that it would be faster and more efficient to assemble a completed teardrop trailer from a kit then to wait for delivery of a completed teardrop trailer from the partnership in the future we intend to obtain additional teardrop trailers by using a kit and independent contractors to assemble the kit the teardop trailer teardrop trailers are designed to be towed behind small economy sized vehicles pickup trucks and any qualified tow vehicles a teardrop trailer also known as a teardrop camper trailer is a streamlined compact lightweight travel trailer which gets its name from its teardrop profile we have ordered the assembly of one teardrop mobile trailer from the partnership at a contract price of  the cost to assemble the teardrop trailer from the kit is a total of  for the kit  for the chassis and  for the services of the independent contractor to assemble the kit on the chassis our teardrop trailers will be approximately  feet  m in width and  feet  m in length and  feet  m in height wheels and tires are outside the body and are covered by fenders our teardrop trailers will be covered with thin sheets of aluminum since teardrop trailers are relatively light most vehicles can tow a teardrop trailer and have little effect on the vehicles fuel consumption we do not intend to lease our teardrop trailers for camping or recreational use however our first trailer will be configured in a camping trailer configuration so as to enhance the residual value of the trailer we believe that some of our future rental customers who will rent our trailers for longer periods may use the interior space for their personnels comfort or for storage our trailers will be assembled upon a chassis that has tail lights wiring fenders wheels and a trailer hitch that is compliant with federal and state regulations we have no formal relationship with any trailer chassis manufacturer but we believe that many manufacturers will continue to offer a chassis that we will utilize in our trailers in the event that chassis become unavailable our business would be adversely affected as we would then have to adjust our designs to fit chassis available from other sources marketing we intend to market our advertising and design services through our website wwwtdropmobilecom we have hired an independent website developer to develop our website which is expected to be completed by december   in addition we intend to offer our mobile billboard advertising services through traditional marketing channels such as trade journals trade catalogues yellow pages advertising and through the personal contacts of our management marketing of our mobile billboard advertising has already commenced as we have made several proposals to motor sports events and advertisers to use our services we also market our consulting services through personal contacts of our officers and majority shareholder we plan to order additional teardrop trailers or kits from either the partnership or independent computer numerical control cnc contractors the cnc contractor will use the plans and designs provided by the partnership the teardrop trailer we ordered will be assembled on trailer chassis that we have obtained from an independent trailer chassis manufacturer we have chosen the unique shape and look of a teardrop trailer as our advertising platform as we believe its eye appeal will be attractive to a target audiences view and retention of the adverting images which will appear on the teardrop trailer in may of  we acquired two fully restored classic vehicles with the intention that these vehicles be used to tow our teardrop trailers and to be used as marketing vehicles for our business we acquired a  chevrolet apache fleetside pickup truck the apache and a  ford ranchero on september   we returned the apache to the seller and the consideration  of our shares valued at  was returned to us the ranchero vehicle will be available to be leased as a tow vehicle with our teardrop trailers or it can be leased independently from the trailers we believe that the use of this vehicle in conjunction with a teardrop trailer will enhance the attractiveness of our advertising offerings to potential lessees we intend to offer advertising space on our trailers advertisement will be installed by applying decals large vinyl sheets as decals or by fastening one large sheet of vinyl to the sides and top of the trailer in addition we will offer to provide our tow vehicle and a driver we believe that the mobile billboard outdoor advertising will offer to advertisers  event marketing  new product launches  retail store openings  grand openings  tradeshow advertising  political advertising and campaigning  publicity  concerts  sporting events  conventions  trade shows  outdoor festivals  beach cities and events  grand openings  holiday events  motion picture premiers we believe that mobile billboard outdoor advertising offers certain advantages to advertisers among which include  mobile trailers are flexible providing one with a wide variety of space and cost options which can be used for anything from short sales promotions to being part of a longterm brand awareness campaign  instead of hoping people see an advertisement the advertisements are brought to them  they are more cost effective than other forms of advertising  we can park the trailer in front of a business or a competitors  we can thoroughly saturate a specific area unlike regular billboards radio tv or direct mail  we can provide specific demographic routes so that there are multiple exposures  mobile billboards create impact because of their movement size and prominence on the road and can go where other advertising can’t they merely have to be visible to attract attention  we can provide advertisements in the middle of all the activity at a special event like a tournament fair tradeshow sporting event et al  as they are eyelevel with consumers the message is communicated directly increasing the impact of the product we will also offer to work closely with our clients to fully understand the clients marketing objectives we will used our best efforts to identify the highest profile locations in our clients target market in order to provide the most efficient high exposure high impact and costeffective mobile billboard advertising campaign at every stage of the process our services will include design branding and selection of graphics to achieve maximum results audio illumination promotional sampling and other sensory elements can be added to further enhance an advertising message our rates will be negotiated at time of agreement with our client our rates will be based upon the range of services length of the advertising contract number of vehicles used miles traveled length of campaign ancillary costs and other variables generally we anticipate our rates to be  for the design and application and removal of graphics to a trailer  per day for the use of the trailer  per day for a tow vehicle and driver based upon a  hour day there will be a  day minimum for each
