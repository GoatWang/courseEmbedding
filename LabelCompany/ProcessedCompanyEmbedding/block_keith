salesforce gets a dose of oracle discipline  bloomberg salesforce gets a dose of oracle discipline the cloud pioneer wants customers to stop buying piecemeal by jack clark jackclarksf more stories by jack clark july    pm edt keith block president of salesforcecom photographer bloomberg more than a decade ago salesforce com became the first powerhouse tech company built entirely around sales and customer service software that’s distributed managed and maintained online today it has annual revenue above  billion and a market value of close to  billion but because it built its business selling to smaller companies salesforce is still a fraction of the size of rivals such as oracle and ibm which regularly nail down bigger deals in february founder and chief executive officer marc benioff set a goal of  billion in annual revenue though he didn’t say when that’s for keith block to worry aboutblock salesforce’s president and a year veteran of oracle has spent the past two years trying to make the cloud company sell more like the hardware giants he’s focused the sales team on securing multiyear megadeals with the likes of cocacola and barclays instead of pitching software in bits and pieces to businesses of any size he’s asking software designers to build more products aimed at specific industries and he’s developed a more rigid aggressive sales strategy meant to answer any question a big client could havethat strategy starts at the top says block when he and benioff pitch ceos “the discussions aren’t really around cloud” he says “they are around ‘how can i change the way i do things with my customer’ every time we sell something we’re solving a business problem” block oversees a team he assembled to manage major accounts that group includes staffers coding industryspecific software the salespeople telling clients why they need it and the customer service reps talking them through each click the goal is to sell more stuff to salesforce’s top  customers who each pay the company about  million a year and get them to spend five times that says steve koenig an analyst with wedbush securities block says he’s tripled the number of deal closings by investing in ignite a program that offers customers free consulting services but declined to comment on specific sales targetsfor salespeople the biggest change under block has been the “do step” a set of dothisthenthat rules he created to guide them through the sales process it’s a serious shift for a sales culture that had long been relatively easygoing says jim steele the company’s former head of worldwide sales who now holds that position at competitor insidesalescom “what keith brought that we frankly always struggled to get at salesforce was a disciplined operational rigor that was unyielding unforgiving” he saysin  block left oracle when instant messages he sent a colleague insulting the quality of oracle products and the behavior of his boss mark hurd became public as part of a hewlettpackard lawsuit against the company benioff hired block soon after telling reporters at the time that the recruitment effort had taken  years “i think the biggest mistake mark hurd ever made was letting keith block leave oracle because he’s probably the best sales executive the enterprise software industry has ever seen” benioff said salesforce revenue has grown from  billion to  billion in block’s first two years there and researcher gartner estimates that the company’s share of the market for customer relationship management software has risen from  percent to  percent deferred revenue has grown from  billion to  billion as the company signs longerterm contracts with larger companies the average contract duration has risen and is now one to three years the company saysat the same time salesforce has been slow to adapt its software designs for the mobile era gartner says several competitors including microsoft have been faster larry augustin the ceo of sugarcrm a smaller competitor says block’s allornothing sales model deemphasizes the quality of individual products “it’s not about each application being innovative in its space it’s about being able to provide a suite of apps from one vendor really the oracle pitch” he says salesforce says rivals can’t match its products’ versatility and block says he regularly gives demos using his iphone  the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up salesforce may also need to worry about turnover as longtime employees chafe against block’s changes says andy price a managing partner at executive recruitment firm schweichler price mullarkey  barry among others steele left in december and four other senior salesforce managers have joined him at insidesales since march but if block is going to meet benioff’s goal price says some new strictures and departures are inevitable “the company needs to behave like a larger more mature company” he says in some cases “that’s just not exciting to the people who’ve got it to this point”the bottom line block is pushing salesforce to focus on selling bigger software packages as he aims to double revenue before its here its on the
