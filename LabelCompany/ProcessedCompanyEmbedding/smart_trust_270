actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities thereby changing their investment mix the securities held in a uit generally remain fixed how are uit securities chosensome uit securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index other uits are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics according to specific objectives once securities are selected the uit portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust can a security held in a uit be removed at any timewhile it is rare a security held in a uit may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances such as a significant decline in credit rating

of the principles this book discusses can be applied in the business world in the education world and in life at home the premise of this book is declared right away incorporating the authors’ own suggestion to declare intent “they people and companies can sense that their lives would be a lot better their jobs a lot more fulfilling and their personal relationships a lot more joyful if they could only operate in an environment of high trust” page  the book is divided into three parts to address this issue the first section sets up the problem with statistics and examples of low trust the question is posed regarding if a lack of trust hurts companies and countries economically this section also introduces smart trust “a competency and a process that enables us to operate with high trust in a low trust world it minimizes risk and maximizes possibilities it optimizes two key factors  a propensity to trust and  analysis” page  the next section discusses how individuals and companies can enact smart trust giving multiple examples of companies and individuals who did just that the final section challenges readers to establish smart trust as well as summarizes the previous two parts throughout the book the text is broken up by graphs images and key quotes the graphs images and a few quotes are helpful however i found that most of the quotes only served to disrupt the flow of my reading and i eventually started skipping those quotes all together since i am sure the authors purposely chose those quotes i would suggest that perhaps the quotes at the end of the section would be more beneficial on the other hand i liked the anecdotes from the authors’ personal experiences that were placed throughout the book even if they interrupted the text this book would probably be a great book for a small group within a company to read meet discuss and implement actions suggested in the book each chapter ends with insightful questions that could lead to businessaltering and lifealtering reflection and answers overall this book managed to capture and keep my attention i was left with the desire to personal reflect on the ideas presented within the

trustthe next several chapters deal with the five smart trust actions• choose to believe in trust the authors delve into the three beliefs of trust a belief in being worthy of trust a belief that most people can be trusted a belief that extending trust is a better way to lead• start with self based on the principles of responsibility and creditability• declare your intent and assume positive intent in others stating what we want to do and why we want to do it • do what you say you are going to do• lead out in extending trust to others it produces results it increases trust and it elicits

most frequently asked question covey received while teaching others the principles from the speed of trust how can someone balance the two extremes of blind trust and total distrust anyone who has ever heard covey speak knows his abilities as a storyteller there is no loss of fidelity when the stories are translated to the page covey profiles notable companies who are successfully applying the principles of smart trustthose principles are defined by five actions readers may find each of the five actions somewhat simplistic however the difference comes in applying them on both a team and organizational level consider the third smart trust action declare your intent and assume positive intent in others executives may readily vouch for their own ability to keep an open mind when dealing with clients or coworkers but what if you have a team that’s experienced trust issues in the past suddenly the advice covey dispenses goes from intuitive to essential this is true of the book as a

client group i have been working with but what might have been an excellent journal article was stretched out to  pages and that makes for some dull readingi can appreciate the challenge rebecca merrill the actual writer had crafting a book out of very little material in fact i think the book gains from her regular repetition of the phrase prosperity energy and joy because it is an everpresent reminder of why we should work so hard to earn and extend trust she does well with that its all the examples and stories that dont really contribute much that i struggled to slog through i dont say this very often but in this case i will i recommend reading the speed of trust itself but the twopage summary of smart trust i will soon post to wwwwhatiscathyreadingcom is all youll need to

will need to go back to the book often to continue my journey in implementing trust in the various arenas of life as i move through the action stepsthe biggest take away from this book is a continuation of the first simply put trust changes everything it plays the biggest part in the bottom line and success of any relationship or organization creating a vocabulary around the principle

per unit by the number of units outstanding the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge the actual net annual
