chip technology also known as emv or smart chip technology it provides added security at chipenabled store terminals and atms many countries have already adopted chip technology and now us merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it too how do i use a chip card you can use chip cards in one of two ways if you are at a merchant location that does not have chipenabled terminals you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual at merchant locations that already accept chip cards youll be prompted to insert your card into the chipenabled terminal be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed when do i swipe when do i insert when in doubt swipe your chip debit card if the terminal is chip enabled it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead where can i use my discover debit card with chip technology your discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today when retailers update their terminals to accept chips just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe do chip payments require signatures or pins your new discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or pin depending on the terminal at chipenabled terminals you will be prompted to provide your signature or pin in some situations you may not need to provide either one i currently have a regular discover debit card when will i receive a chip card you will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires if your card is lost or stolen or if you experience fraud on your account if we have a joint account will we both get new chip cards each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires if your debit card is lost or stolen only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card if you request a new chip card early only the requester will receive a new card if i am a new customer and just signed up for an account will i get both types of cards no new customers will only receive a chip debit card if i request a chip card will my debit card information change yes your debit card number security code expiration date and pin will change because of this we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card including any automatic bill payments please note that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card then only that person will receive a new chip debit card how does the chip work when you insert your chip debit card at a chipenabled terminal the embedded microchip generates unique dynamic data for each transaction this makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information which in turn can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account what are the benefits chip technology provides an additional layer of card security chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chipenabled terminals other benefits include ease of use its still a debit card so just use it like before once merchants adopt this technology the terminals will prompt you to insert your card added security the chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at

chip technology also known as emv or smart chip technology it provides added security at chipenabled store terminals and atms many countries have already adopted chip technology and now us merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it too how do i use a chip card you can use chip cards in one of two ways if you are at a merchant location that does not have chipenabled terminals you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual at merchant locations that already accept chip cards youll be prompted to insert your card into the chipenabled terminal be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed when do i swipe when do i insert when in doubt swipe your chip debit card if the terminal is chip enabled it will recognize that your

market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  yearsday annualized yield represents past performance and future yields will vary principal is not guaranteed the annualized day yield is calculated based on the income generated by an investment in the fund over a sevenday period and is expressed as an annual percentage rate the yield quotation more closely

affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will

market funds  pensions  investments defined contribution dc plans expected to exit prime money market funds lori lucas thinks there will be a flurry of activity on prime money market funds starting in the second quarter david toerge tighter sec regulations prompting sponsors to look for other options by robert steyer · january   consultants expect many defined contribution plans to move away from prime money market funds in the face of a looming october deadline for new sec regulations that might create complications for sponsors they say the key issue for dc plans is the securities and exchange commission rule requiring providers of prime money market funds to create redemption gates — or limits — on withdrawals by participants and to establish fees on withdrawals to prevent a run on the funds “it would be hard to explain to participants why they cant access their money” if a redemption gate were imposed said philip suess a chicagobased partner at investment consulting firm mercer llc “sponsors have to determine their ability to live with redemption gates” related coverage money market fund reforms challenges for asset owners kentucky  plan to drop  money market funds callan dc plan executives focusing on investment policy fees and compliance dont delay moves on money market investors warned most firms not ready for new sec money market rules — survey among mercers dc clients “it was very quiet” after the sec issued its rules in july  until the fourth quarter of  he said “weve now reached the point where sponsors are paying attention they are realizing that it takes time to implement changes” among mercers dc clients that have made a decision “a lot” have moved to government money market funds which wont be affected by the new rules he said “we havent seen a lot of interest in ultrashort bond funds or stable value” said mr suess adding that a client staying with a prime money market account “is the exception” fee amounts and redemptiongate terms depend on how much a moneymarket funds weekly liquid assets fall below the funds total assets the sec said fund providers have some leeway in setting the amount of fees and length of redemptiongate limits although the prospect of imposing redemption gates and fees might be remote it “will be so far beyond participants expectations” if fund providers enforce them said christopher lyon a partner at rocaton investment advisors llc norwalk conn such a jolt to participants holding a conservative investment could shake their confidence he said many rocaton dc clients already offer government money market funds and those with prime money market funds likely will switch to a government fund because of the sec rules mr lyon said for plans contemplating a change rocaton has been recommending since midjuly that they act quickly to avoid being placed in a queue by their record keepers in case of a lastminute rush of sponsors switching funds complicated new rules “the fees and gates are too complicated for participants” said martha tejera president of tejera  associates a dc investment and plandesign consulting firm in seattle “prime money market funds will disappear from k plans” when the sec issued its regulations it exempted dc plans from the floating net asset value requirement that will apply to prime money market funds held by institutions the sec said such funds in qualified dc plans will be classified as “retail” funds because their investors are individuals rather than corporations or institutions despite the long lead time from the secs announcement to enactment dc industry members say many sponsors still havent declared if they will keep a prime money market fund or switch to a government money market fund stable value fund or ultrashort bond fund “our client base has been pretty quiet” said lorie latham a chicagobased director at willis towers watson plc who directs us strategy for investments for dc plans “weve done quite a lot of education but there hasnt been much movement theres still time for sponsors to act” in a survey of  dc sponsors offering some form of money market fund callan associates inc found that  of plan executives were still unsure about what they would do the survey said  of plan executives wont change anything because they dont offer a prime money market fund while  said the sec rules affecting prime money market funds are acceptable also  said they would switch to a stable value option from a prime money market fund and  would move to a government money market fund from the prime money market fund these responses are part of a broader survey that callan will publish later this month “there will be an aggressive timeline after the first quarter” for sponsors to meet the sec deadline said lori lucas the chicagobased executive vice president and defined contribution practice leader for callan days to switch consultants say a money market fund switch by sponsors could take as much as  days to complete the plans investment policy committee has to make a decision and executives must find a replacement fund record keepers also need time to accommodate the changes and participants must be informed robert salerno senior vice president fidelity investments boston said hes confident fidelitys recordkeeping business can handle dc clients moneymarket fund decisions right now “not many” clients have changed their money market funds said mr salerno “they probably have initial indications what they want to do we wont see a majority of decisions being made until the second quarter” fidelity has made some changes affecting all clients  not just dc plans for example it has converted three prime money market funds to government money market funds and it merged a prime fund and a government fund to create a new government money market fund in a recent survey by pensions  investments and rocaton dc plan sponsors said they believed their peers most likely would replace the prime money market funds with a government or treasury money market fund the second most popular outcome would be moving to a stable value fund followed by retaining the prime money market fund sponsors were not asked what they planned to do themselves when record keepers and consultants were asked what sponsors might do the pirocaton survey said the top three choices were shifting to a government or treasury money market fund offering a stable value fund and choosing an ultrashort bond fund the survey reported that  of sponsors and  of other dc industry members said there must be a “proactive disclosure” to participants about redemption gates and liquidity fees for those plans retaining prime money market funds in an interview mr lyon said he was concerned that some money market providers might not explain these requirements “beyond the bare minimum notice” n news defined contribution plans sec this article originally appeared in the january   print issue as prime money market exits likely ahead

projected retirement date time frame the funds allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors retirement goals will be met the target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals american funds investment professionals manage the target date funds portfolio moving it from a more growthoriented strategy to a more incomeoriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date investment professionals continue to manage each fund for  years after it reaches its target date the target allocations are as of january   and are subject to the portfolio oversight committees discretion the funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than  above or below these allocations investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservationoriented the funds allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors education savings goals will be met the target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs the retirement income portfolio series investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed there are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fundoffunds expenses the funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds payments consisting of return of capital

atms many countries have already adopted chip technology and now us merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it too how do i use a chip card you can use chip cards in one of two ways if you are at a merchant location that does not have chipenabled terminals you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual at merchant locations that already accept chip cards youll be prompted to insert your card into the chipenabled terminal be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed when do i swipe when do i insert when in doubt swipe your chip debit card if the terminal is chip enabled it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead where can i use my discover debit card with chip technology your discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today when retailers update their terminals to accept chips just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe do chip payments require signatures or pins your new discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or pin depending on the terminal at chipenabled terminals you will be prompted to provide your signature or pin in some situations you may not need to provide either one i currently have a regular discover debit card when will i receive a chip card you will receive a chip debit card when your

if i request a chip card will my debit card information change yes your debit card number security code expiration date and pin will change because of this we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card including any automatic bill payments please note that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card then only that person will receive a new chip debit card how does the chip work when you insert your chip debit card at a chipenabled terminal the embedded microchip generates unique dynamic data for each transaction this makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information which in turn can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account what are the benefits chip technology provides an
