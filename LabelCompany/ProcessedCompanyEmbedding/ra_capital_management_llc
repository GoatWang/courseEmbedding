rocheroche oncologysanofisanofi shireteva overview top techatlas is a division of ra capital that functions as an internal think tank analyzing scientific and clinical data from academic literature and the thousands of industry product development programs we track to answer the following questions that we expect would be of interest to industry stakeholders as well as policy makers physicians and patients landscape for a given disease what is the current treatment paradigm what are all the technologies in development and how are they similar different and possibly complementary to one another we answer this question with a dendrogram ie mindmap at the heart of every map which clearly presents the range of technologies that are likely to impact a disease within the foreseeable future direction what might the standard of care look like in  years and even  years given the probabilities of success of various technologies and their relative efficacies safety profiles tolerability and cost how can companies “skate to where the puck is going to be” the answer to these questions helps define the development path and clinical trial designs that will prove that a drug device or diagnostic should be incorporated not into today’s standard of care but into the one that will exist when the technology is actually coming to market this analysis also predicts which technologies may theoretically be left behind and the course corrections that might enable companies to “futureproof” themselves against shifts in the competitive landscape and unmet needs endgame given the underlying genetic and biochemical etiologies of a disease which technologies may be necessary to prevent cure or at least best manage a disease and which technologies are aiming for lesser goals eg suboptimally managing a disease answer we believe that companies should define themselves by the problem they aim to solve which requires a technologyagnostic approach to clinical development therefore the answer to this question not only guides our investments but also enables our portfolio companies and drug hunters eg eirs and advisors to understand which technologies they can license and develop to make sure that they are always working towards the most competitive target product profile incumbentsdisruptors which companies currently profit from the standard of care in a given disease area how are they vulnerable to disruptions and what should they be doing to futureproof their market position if not strengthen it are there technologies that they should be developing or companies they should be partnering with or acquiring which smaller companies can cater to the strategic needs of the incumbents answer addressing these strategic questions is relatively straightforward once we have constructed a map showing us who we should introduce our portfolio companies to so they can explore collaborations partnerships or ma even when licensable drugs do not yet exist this analysis also reveals gaps in many companies’ portfolios that platform companies could aim to fill by developing drugs for particular targets which is particularly useful for portfolio prioritization reimbursement strategy what could payers or policy makers do to increase the degree of price competition or restrict use of branded products in the future in a particular disease area in turn how if even possible can companies in that space still succeed commercially answer payers typically take advantage of generics and multiple branded agents in the same class to exact discounts and policy makers are slow to change the rules and therefore the usual answer for how innovators can maintain future profits is to stay innovative and develop products so much better than the alternatives that payers cannot deny their value to patients sometimes the maps point to an endgame beyond which further improvements are unlikely at which point companies need to prepare for margin compression frequently asked questions top why do you make maps answer to understand complex and competitive subjects to more effectively communicate what we have learned both amongst our team members and with others and to capture institutional knowledge our maps restore context to subjects that have been shattered by the proliferation of data and options allowing us to make decisions about where to allocate our resources intelligently and efficiently and helping our portfolio companies and collaborators also make better decisions why can’t i clearly see the maps on this website answer because they are proprietary to ra capitaltechatlas and we are only showing you a teaser to stimulate further discussion how can i see the full maps clearly answer come to our offices to explore the maps with us we have large touchscreen displays in our offices that make it easy to navigate the maps we’re always looking for a productive brainstorm with researchers clinicians entrepreneurs and drug hunters small innovative companies large biotech and pharma payers policy makers and institutions interested in partnering with ra capital we do have mobile systems or in a pinch we can print out the maps if we’re going to do some brainstorming on the road can i have or purchase a map answer under certain circumstances we have issued limited licenses to one or more maps but it’s not common the techatlas maps are integral to ra capital and meant to facilitate collaborative learning we are therefore more likely to make them available to companies or other groups with whom we already frequently interact eg portfolio companies how do you decide on what to map answer we’re mapping everything that is of interest to us there are plenty of topics that we still want to get to sometimes we see a critical mass of new ideas emerge around a common theme eg immuneoncology we have even structured maps based on the needs of particular portfolio companies so that they could see many of the indications to which their platform technology could be applied as new platforms emerge they may inspire us to map the world from their perspective from what perspective do you map technologies answer our disease maps are typically mapped from the standpoint of a physician who wants to best treat a patient our analyses factor in efficacy safety tolerability convenience and cost considerations mechanism of action in and of itself not important to a patient is important to the extent that it helps predict how new drug candidates are likely to perform eg drugs with sufficiently different moas are more likely to have nonoverlapping toxicities and additive or synergistic efficacy making them potentially combinable which is what’s important to a physician our “capability” maps eg immuneoncology gene therapy epigenetics take the perspective of a drug developer trying to make a useful product with a particular function the same technology for example a cart program targeting multiple myeloma mm may appear both on the mm map in the context of other mm drugs as well as on the immunooncology map in juxtaposition to other cart programs including those targeting other cancers as well as pd antibodies and cancer vaccines although nearly all the maps have what we call a solutions matrix that shows how well equipped each competitor is in a given field and which technologies could help fill each player’s gaps we also create strategy maps that look at the world from the perspective of large pharma so that we can help smaller companies understand what might be important to potential partnersacquirers can the maps directly benefit patients answer our maps highlight compelling trials and drug candidates we consider most likely to improve the standard of care which we expect may be of interest to patients the ideal way for us to help patients would be through patient advocacy groups we do not have a formal mechanism for interacting with patients due to liability concerns when we have spoken with individuals seeking medical information we have volunteered a list of recently approved products and advanced clinical trials that we considered credible for them to discuss with their physician can the maps help me decide my next career move answer yes – time permitting we would be happy to help how an individual makes an important career decision teaches us something about how we should think about investing our own time and capital i’m a drug hunter – could your maps help me answer yes beyond even the maps ra capitaltechatlas is a platform for drug hunting and company formation see “translation and hunting” how can i become a techatlas associate answer we welcome all qualified applicants after a phone interview some applicants are asked to make a map of an area we already know well of which a select few are invited in for final interviews and to present their map to members of our team a bit like a thesis defense but harder after which we make a hiring decision see “join us” join us top techatlas is always seeking smart intellectually curious and driven scientists to help us make sense of datarich healthcare technology landscapes while learning to incorporate business strategy into their thinking our current team consists of phd and undergraduate scientists from toptier institutions backgrounds include molecular biology biomedical engineering pharmacology neuroscience genomics and other disciplines there is no one degree or specialty that makes a great techatlas  associate rather candidates need to speak the general language of science thinking scientifically eg naturally sense when a conclusion is invalid due to lack of a control and be capable of rapidly understanding a new area we do not look for or require prior financial or

experienced “drug hunters” see translation and hunting tab  beyond capital in addition to capital ra capital invests considerable time and resources into helping its private and public portfolio companies succeed we leverage our techatlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for inlicensing consideration members of our investment team take board andor observer seats when appropriate we also host board meetings at our offices from time to time providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions we help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us in certain cases we may license one or more maps to them when appropriate our team can create a custom map that comprehensively aggregates and organizes rd opportunities as well as competitive and complementary technologies in those indications portfolio companies have access to the techatlas team’s primary scientific and market research we interview clinicians and kols host advisory boards and attend many academic conferences our literature surveillance team flags discoveries that may be important to portfolio companies our graphics design team helps portfolio companies communicate complex concepts with high quality graphics for their slides and websites sometimes incorporating techatlas map elements our communications team can offer assistance with grant writing and preparation of scientific publications tab  translation  hunting we are interested in both the novel and the reimagined discoveries and improvements in chemistry molecular and cell biology and material science create novel capabilities that open up new possibilities for tackling previously unsolved challenges the rules by which we understand biology are also constantly being defined and revised revealing new applications for existing technologies and partiallydeveloped drug candidates programs we consider worthwhile may form the basis for a new venture ra capital’s techatlas platform is designed to systematize the translation of novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation in those areas that we have mapped it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanisminspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned trial designs and endpoints competing and complementary agents current and future standard of care market size comparable pricing financing strategy and potential acquirers all meant to enable a thoughtful firstpass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment the size and efficiency of our team allows us to parallelize the firstpass assessment of many ideas sourced from literature technology transfer offices pipelines of large pharma as well as small biotechnology companies as well as discussions with academic researchers and clinicians we welcome experienced drug hunters searching for technologiescandidates and looking to start new companies to collaborate with our team and take advantage of the breadth and depth that the techatlas platform has to offer as well as the capital we manage we believe that when a business proposition is framed correctly the capital markets have the resources and depth of understanding to fund proper experimental design and solution development without forcing companies to cut corners and we have collaborated extensively with other funds that share our philosophy to enable ambitious and capital intensive endeavors we owe a debt to the people who have mentored us and we in turn have a

performance ra capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes which converge on a higher quality and more costeffective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes these investment themes may change in the future prevention  cures diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent andor cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression especially if only incrementally we are interested in ambitious objectives hard outcomes measures and proper controls costeffective diagnostics  interventions most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness we are interested in seeing data from phase  and phase  clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors genetic testing  personalized medicine we are looking for companies with lowcost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing andor other diagnostics including exclusive access to relevant wellcurated patient samples and healthcare outcomes we have particular interest in a number of current niche areas including carrier tests prenatal tests and the combination of preimplantation diagnosisivf because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of lowcost sequencing patientphysician convenience there will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an outpatient procedure allowing a patient to take an oral pill or selfadminister a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an iv infusion or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results however until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched eg in the us physicians in private practice have a financial incentive aka “asp” to prescribe expensive ivadministered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive smallmolecule replacements for biologics although it is clear from the fda guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilarsbiogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that smallmolecules are when patents expire it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation we are interested in smallmolecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacysafety to biologics ideally with greater convenience to patients eg oral pills vs injectables we expect that all else being equal public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” smallmolecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics  park plaza boston ma  t  contact us ra capital management  park plaza suite  boston ma  t wwwracapcom top contact

beyond capital in addition to capital ra capital invests considerable time and resources into helping its private and public portfolio companies succeed we leverage our techatlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for inlicensing consideration members of our investment team take board andor observer seats when appropriate we also host board meetings at our offices from time to time providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions we help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us in certain cases we may license one or

novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation in those areas that we have mapped it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanisminspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned trial designs and endpoints competing and complementary agents current and future standard of care market size comparable pricing financing strategy and potential acquirers all meant to enable a thoughtful firstpass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment the size and efficiency of our team

performance ra capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes which converge on a higher quality and more costeffective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes these investment themes may change in the future prevention  cures diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent andor cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression especially if only incrementally we are interested in ambitious objectives hard outcomes measures and proper controls costeffective diagnostics  interventions most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness we are interested in seeing data from phase  and phase  clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors genetic testing  personalized medicine we are looking for companies with lowcost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing andor other diagnostics including exclusive access to relevant wellcurated patient samples and healthcare outcomes we have particular interest in a number of current niche areas including carrier tests prenatal tests and the combination of preimplantation diagnosisivf because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of lowcost sequencing patientphysician convenience there will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an outpatient procedure allowing a patient to take an oral pill or selfadminister a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an iv infusion or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results however until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched eg in the us physicians in private practice have a financial incentive aka “asp” to prescribe expensive ivadministered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive smallmolecule replacements for biologics although it is clear from the fda guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilarsbiogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that smallmolecules are when patents expire it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation we are interested in smallmolecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacysafety to biologics ideally with greater convenience to patients eg oral pills vs injectables we expect that all else being equal public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” smallmolecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics  park plaza boston ma  t  contact us ra capital management  park plaza suite  boston ma  t wwwracapcom top contact
