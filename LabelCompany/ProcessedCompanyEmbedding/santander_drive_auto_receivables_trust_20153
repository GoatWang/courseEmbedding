potential downgrade of one or two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings below bsf or possibly default under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence
