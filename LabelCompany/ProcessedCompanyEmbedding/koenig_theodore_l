realized to date mr koenig said i am very proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time i am also very optimistic about the growth prospects for monroe

this is similar to the economic situation we faced when we started our first fund in  when the financing market appeared to be at its peak our business thrives on market uncertainty both in an expanding market and a down market with respect to the business of hilco capital lp mr koenig adds it will continue to be business as usual for all of our existing portfolio investments and loan

credit introducing an array of new lending options for buyout shops the chicago specialty finance company which announced monday it raised  million for a new limited partnerbacked fund announced friday it will raise  million from public investors by forming a business development company monroe capital corp the regulatory filing also said monroe capital received a license in february from the small business administration to operate monroe capital partners fund lp as a small business investment company sbic opening the door for additional lending capacity of up to  million “from the customer’s standpoint it’s the same product” said theodore l koenig monroe capital’s president and chief executive officer referring to the lender’s lineup of senior secured junior secured and mezzanine loans “we want to provide consistent flexible capital to our borrowers” because the company is now in registration for a public offering of stock koenig said he was in a quiet period and could not discuss the company’s strategy but the filing itself provides some hints as do koenig’s previous statements because it has public stockholders a bdc provides permanent capital to a lender and as long as it maintains a share price at least equal to the net asset value of the loans in its portfolio it can return to the market whenever conditions are favorable to raise additional capital but a bdc also has limitations it can generally invest only in privatelyheld us companies and unlike a fundbased lender which can use leverage to the extent that the market will bear to increase its returns to lps a bdc is limited to a  leverage ratio an sbic has a different set of restrictions backed by lp investors it can lend only to us companies generally borrowers with less than  employees and it typically focuses on mezzanine lending it is usually limited to  million in capital investments and it can use  leverage adding on up to  million in debt to form a  million fund an sbic can bundle and sell a portfolio of loans through an sba debenture program replenishing the fund with proceeds priced at an interest rate tied to year treasury bonds both monroe capital’s bdc and sbic will operate beneath the company’s existing llc umbrella forming a lending complex that should enable koenig and his staff to match the borrower to the vehicle as koenig said in monday’s fund announcement “our strategy of providing a total onestop financing solution to lower middlemarket companies differentiates monroe from other finance companies and positions us well in the market to be a valueadded strategic partner to both banks and our prospective clients” the new bdc will establish its initial portfolio from  loans now owned by monroe capital llc which had  million under management and more than  loans in its portfolio as of dec  according to the filing the fair value of the initial portfolio is  million these bdcbound loans—  percent senior secured debt  percent unitranche secured debt and  percent junior secured debt— were chosen because “they are similar to the type of investments we plan to originate” the filing said but future loans will be less concentrated in senior tranches and include more of a mix of senior unitranche and junior secured debt monroe capital announced earlier this year that it had hired six new staffers including a managing director to support its plans to lend more aggressively in  the firm is looking now for managers to run the bdc offering the filing said koenig said such ipos typically take  to 9 days steve bills is a senior editor at buyouts

president  ceo monroe capital llc now that we have all lived through the credit crisis and are still around to talk about it where do we go from here what do finance professionals and cfos need to know in order to navigate the us financing and capital markets now and in  monroe capital’s ted koenig addresses three important areas of concern going forward there are three questions that every one of us has thought about over the last several months where will liquidity come from and who will be providing it how will deals get done postcredit crisis what are the things keep finance professionals and cfos awake at night whether you’re a banker finance professional cfo or service provider we all have a vested interest in the answers to these questions this article highlights some relevant and interesting market trends in these areas news flash banks make money today by not lending ever wonder why banks do not have huge lending appetites right now consider this thomas hoenig president of the federal reserve bank kansas city said recently that the federal reserve’s policy of holding interest rates near zero is a subsidy for large banks that redistributes wealth from savers to debtors testifying before the house subcommittee on domestic monetary policy hoenig said banks can borrow at  and buy treasury bonds that yield over  “it provides them a means to generate earnings and restore capital but it also reflects a subsidy to their operations” hoenig said “it is not the federal reserve’s job to pave the yield curve with guaranteed returns for any sector of the economy and we should not be guaranteeing a return for wall street or any special interest group” hoenig added with a “riskfree” return of  leveraged at ten times it is no wonder why banks today are not aggressively making new loans the place to be as megadeals lose their luster middlemarket companies are becoming increasingly attractive private equity investors are increasingly focusing their efforts on middlemarket companies investments in these companies demand less capital than larger deals and have greater flexibility when it comes to cashing out this makes middlemarket investing particularly attractive at a time when money remains tight and fundraising is challenging in the wake of the recession and global financial crunch the statistics bear this out middlemarket deal volume is increasing both in terms of the number of transactions and the dollar value of deals see figures  and  one of the factors driving this growth in middlemarket deal volume is the increasing number of flexible capital sources available — capital sources that have the ability to structure deals in a variety of ways that best suit the needs of middlemarket companies to finance growth private capital providers can deliver structures that allow for greater free cashflow generation due to lower amortization and cash interest requirements in exchange for pik interest equity warrants and successbased fees this allows borrowers to partner with creative lenders that are better aligned with the goals of financing growth and longterm profitability while still benefiting from the lower cost of capital and tax advantages of traditional debt financing fasten your seatbelts it’s time to blast off for investment bankers private equity professionals and deal financierslenders companies have been hoarding cash for more than two years however inflation is on the horizon and cash will have less value with the economy slowly turning around companies are spending on acquisitions designed to move their businesses forward rather than protecting them against the woes of a bad economy wellcapitalized corporate buyers continue to seek growth realization of synergies and diversification through strategic acquisitions that expand their footprint and product offerings the current us private equity overhang dry powder stands at  billion since  private equity fundraising has been driven not by the supply of private equity investments but rather by limited partner demand for private equity investments this disconnect provides a partial explanation of the current overhang over the last decade  trillion was raised by private equity firms with followon funds raising nearly double the amount of their predecessor funds while consistently surpassing fundraising targets in addition a third of all funds since  were raised by firsttime fund managers allowing limited partners to diversify their holdings as their allocations expanded the current overhang is unsustainable — given the nature of private equity fund structures firms will lose the ability to invest this capital once their investment period runs out at today’s deal flow pace it would take around five years to invest the current overhang which means that private equity firms must start investing now at a much higher rate if they want to invest their full fund and collect the fees and carry on those remaining commitments these private equity firms will try their hardest to put this capital to use which should result in a plethora of ma activity game changer unitranche debt has gained significant traction with middlemarket borrowers unitranche debt provides borrowers with the benefits of flexible capital and a more efficient lending process that increases the speed with which borrowers can execute deals unitranche lending has become a common method of financing middlemarket companies and many private equity firms and lenders prefer unitranche debt over the conventional capital structure involving a senior debt provider and a mezzanine debt provider there are fewer parties to deal with no intercreditor agreement issues among lenders and one set of rules and regulations for the company rather than having a separate interest rate for senior and mezzanine debt the unitranche structure employs a single blended rate that averages out the cost of the two forms of capital the simplicity of working with a single party can also help close deals quicker an attractive characteristic for firms that value ease of execution and speed in recent months our firm’s clients have increasingly been requesting the unitranche product with over  of our financings involving unitranche debt the sba has become a popular partner for both private equity and lenders at a time when fundraising has significantly decreased and it’s been harder overall for private equity firms to raise new funds the small business administration sba has stepped up to the plate the sba’s growth capital program which invests in mezzanine and growth capital increased its lending by  in fiscal year  providing a record 9 billion to investors backing small businesses last year saw the highest volume in the year history of the sba’s small business investment company sbic debenture program as the administration has fended off accusations that small business was ignored amid the bailouts — be it the troubled asset relief program or the temporary liquidity guarantee program — the sba has been quietly putting capital to work directly into small businesses via the sbic “it costs the taxpayers zero and we are expecting the program to continue to grow in ” according to sean greene an associate administrator for investment and senior adviser for innovation at the sba sbics are privately owned and managed investment firms that are licensed and regulated by the sba sbics use a combination of funds raised from traditional limited partners and the sba to make equity and mezzanine capital investments in small businesses there are currently more than  sbics with more than  billion in capital under management bank loan funds have been and will continue to be very popular with investors which in turn has created a white hot highyield market for large market companies yeartodate june  mutual funds have registered inflows of more than  billion into leveraged loans already surpassing the  billion in total inflows recorded in all of  according to lipper fmi the outlook for credit is positive buoyed by strong corporate earnings and low default rates a new crop of floating rate funds are aiming to take advantage of robust demand for bank loans as investors seek midsingle digit returns and protection against an eventual rise in interest rates at least eight mutual funds that will invest primarily in senior floating rate bank loans have launched this year or are preparing to launch according to sec filings bank loans are loans made to noninvestment grade large corporate borrowers expectations of a future rise in interest rates combined with a positive outlook for us corporate credit have raised the profile of bank loans among both institutional and retail investors the floating rate aspect makes bank loans a natural hedge against rising interest rates and inflation examples of major investment management firms launching floating rate funds include credit suisse’s asset management division recently relaunched the credit suisse floating high rate high income fund the fund was previously focused on us highyield investments “the relaunch is a shift in the execution of the investment strategy to an emphasis on floating rate bank loans over highyield bonds the highyield bond fund field is crowded and the bank loan space has a compelling investment rationale” said john popp head of credit suisse’s credit investment group global investment managing firm pimco launched the pimco senior floating rate fund an openend mutual fund in july  nuveen investments recently completed the initial public offering of the nuveen short duration credit opportunities fund a new closedend fund that will invest in below investment grade adjustable rate corporate debt instruments including senior secured loans and second lien loans prudential investments in april began offering the prudential floating rate income fund gso capital partners the credit platform of the blackstone group is preparing to launch its third closedend senior loan fund according to a regulatory filing in may babson capital management said it would launch a global closedend fund to invest in floating rate assets including secured loans according to a regulatory filing kkr asset management is raising a global closedend fund to invest in fixedincome securities including loans and highyield bonds an april regulatory filing said all of these funds will be competing for large market broadly syndicated loan investments and highyield bonds making this a very crowded space senior secured direct lending will become even more popular with institutional investors senior secured direct lending represents an attractive investment opportunity in the current market environment this is driven by the imbalance between low supply of capital for middlemarket corporate borrowers and high demand from these companies the dearth of available credit from traditional bank lenders in the middlemarket space as opposed to the large market space has created a favorable environment for investors funds with both capital to invest and the proper investment structure can utilize strong credit skills to seek returns in the high single digits and perhaps more this is accomplished by investing in a diversified portfolio of selforiginated senior secured corporate loans the senior secured nature of the investment offers downside protection to the investor the returns in this segment of the market are at a significant spread to those available to investors focused on the large liquid credit names in bank loan funds this investment opportunity is consistent with monroe capital’s view that investors with a longterm horizon and the ability to invest in longer lockup vehicles can benefit from a premium that accrues to illiquid and more complex investments this investment can be utilized in the context of an opportunistic credit allocation a client’s hedge fund sleeve or within a broader fixed income portfolio from the perspective of a borrower senior secured financing is attractive because it does not require the company to give up significant equity ownership or control of their business instead the loan is backed by collateral such as property plant equipment inventory and receivables access to credit by the borrower is a function of the nature of such collateral the amount of free cash flow generated the health of their business as well as the type of business and to a significant extent the current condition of the capital markets private equity investing has become a much more difficult business this decade than it was in the last  years if we look at the period from 9 to  the overall market maintained an upward trajectory and the use of leverage made perfect sense during that time in 9 debt created returns because we were operating in a high inflation environment with interest rates that only moved lower for the next ten years in a sense you could buy a business with absolutely no growth leverage it with 9 plus debt watch inflation grow by  and triple your money that was the story of the 9s in the 99s we had the greatest bull market of all time from january 99 to the end of 999 you could leverage just about anything and post an attractive return if you just levered the stock market for example you would have been a leading fund manager however going into this decade of the s investors will have to navigate a choppy upanddown market and not rely on an upcycle to bail them out with inflation at least checked for now private equity fund managers are going to have to earn their stripes it is now a fullfledged business as opposed to merely a form of finance esops will gain in popularity for ma transactions increasingly closely held business owners are turning to employee stock ownership plans to create liquidity from their businesses this is due partly to the changing ma landscape after the recession partly to the aging of baby boomer business owners and partly to recently improved designs for transactions involving employee stock ownership plans from a tax perspective an esop appeals to selling shareholders because the transaction can be structured to permanently avoid payment of capital gains taxes if they are a c corporation at the time of the sale while the company can receive large income tax deductions for the repayment of both principal and interest on the acquisition costs an esop is a friendly financial buyer created for the sole purpose of buying a shareholder’s stock the seller will dictate the amount of stock he or she wants to sell and the cash he or she wants to receive at closing if senior debt does not provide enough up front liquidity investment and mezzanine debt can be brought in the most typical esop candidates are longterm businesses with consistent earnings often when there are limited cash options from strategic or financial buyers the esop creates the only available market an esop can also be used as a taxefficient strategy for one shareholder to buy out another clos are off life support and viable again the pipeline for new collateralized loan obligation clo deals stands now at 9 billion so far this year  billion in clos have been printed in the us with the majority being clos backed by broadly syndicated loans around  billion in clos were issued in  according to data from citibank the us clo market has made a strong comeback this year after succumbing to a difficult credit crisis in  investors are lining up both for clos’ seniormost tranches and for the equity piece as the economics of investing in a clo improve over time returns to equity holders in new issue clo deals this year are being marketed at  to  and even though many clo managers are reportedly financing a hefty part of the equity tranches on their own market participants say that interest is coming in from various quarters such as insurance companies banks and private equity funds warning the fed is closely watching leveraged loans the federal reserve which has come under heavy criticism for failing to spot the housing market bubble is now paying close attention to runups in asset prices that could pose risks to financial stability in early june vice chairman janet yellen identified one of the markets the central bank is monitoring the most closely leveraged loans in a speech given in tokyo yellen said the fed is concerned that the large amount of money investors are pouring into syndicated loans has contributed to a rapid increase in purchase prices that could result in imprudent lending yellen noted that strong demand from investors has allowed borrowers to bargain for more attractive loan terms “especially given that many funds catering to retail and other unlevered investors have little choice but to immediately deploy invested funds” she cited as evidence “the reemergence of deals that do not provide investors with the traditional protection of maintenance covenants —so called covenantlite structures —and of deals financing the distribution of dividends to equity holders as well as a gradual increase in the levering of the underlying corporate assets by borrowers” yellen also noted that prior to the financial crisis lead arrangers of syndicated loans amassed significant pipelines of very large deals that they committed to finance when investor interest waned the banks were left with notable positions in “hung” deals which resulted in substantial marktomarket losses when prices came under pressure calls for additional collateral followed leading in many cases to the sale of positions by banks and other market participants that put further pressure on valuations and started the cycle anew it is speculated that if the fed were to introduce regulation it would most likely take the form of requirements that arrangers retain a portion of loans through maturity so that if there is downside risk particularly in the recovery mechanics of the loan the banks or parties involved in the construction of the product would bear some of that risk theodore ted l koenig is president and ceo of monroe capital llc a
