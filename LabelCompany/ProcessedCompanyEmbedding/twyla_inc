is getting into the corporate lunch game twyla a yearandahalfyearold startup that collaborates with artists to create exclusive prints for sale at its site at prices that range from  to  has raised  million in new funding led by gv with participation from earlier investors ivp and redpoint ventures the company has now raised  million altogether twyla was cofounded by homeaway cofounder brian sharples and employs  people in austin tex and it’s pitching itself a win for artists and art lovers a like while it’s making accessible the work of people who’ve shown at top museums and galleries including lacma moma and the whitney museum it says a limitededition licensing model that it employs should also provide these artists with valuable revenue and exposure to a wider audience to make things even easier the artist chooses a frame for customers which is included in its price to make the prints easier to consider in person the company is beginning to partner with venues like boutique hotels that can act as “showrooms” for its pieces twyla has plenty of competition starting with yearold artcom and including younger companies curioos and juniqe among others we were in touch last night with sharples’ cofounder and company ceo matt randall — who previously cofounded the pop austin international art show — to ask why that isn’t stopping the company tc you started this company with brian sharples who is also its chairman how did you come together mr  i was producing a popup art fair i cofounded in austin and ruminating over bringing the art show to other cities i serendipitously met brian at one of the popup art fairs he and his friends a gallerist and artist together had an idea around creating an online art company we realized that we were all thinking the same thing that our lives are increasingly curated but the vast majority of people don’t know where to go to buy art or what to purchase shortly later brian selected me as twyla’s ceo tc how does twyla differentiate itself from all the other curated art marketplaces out there mr there’s no one that is doing exactly what twyla is doing we are creating the first company that delivers fine art on demand and at scale we’re also the first company to facilitate the entire process for both artists and customers from beginning to end tc what does that mean how does this limitededition licensing model work for starters mr twyla scans the artists’ originals at an incredibly high dpi works with the artist until they are thrilled with the print and then creates an edition from  to  works the artist has complete control over the process and the limited edition prints enable artists to gain visibility and income without having to produce additional originals tc why did you settle on a price band of  to   mr we believe that’s the sweet spot of the market for new buyers seeking art of extraordinary quality we share a significant part of the sale price and commission with the artists we believe our pieces present a great value given the quality of both the artists and the artwork and given that the pieces are priced at a small fraction of the originals twyla offers a  experience at a fraction of the cost to the originals tc how much of each sale does twyla keep mr we don’t disclose that information but we do share revenue with our artists our showroom partners and in some cases decorators and designers i do want to point out that through twyla artists can make twice as much as they do through a traditional gallery arrangement tc you’ve selected the work of roughly  artists to get started how do new artists who become aware of twyla get on the platform relatedly how does twyla scale its curation process mr  we’re launching with   works from  artists who have been handselected by our curation team and through wordofmouth from other artists these artists are top contemporary artists who have been collected by the most significant museums and galleries around the world so maintaining a highly curated experience is imperative we will never be a clearing house for art tc is there a customer satisfaction guarantee mr we want people to be  percent satisfied with their artwork and experience so we offer a day money back guarantee buyers can return the piece no questions asked at no cost to them we believe this is a guarantee unlike any other in the art world tc you’ve raised  million where is it going mr twyla raised  million in our seed round which ivp and redpoint ventures participated in then we closed a  million series a round that was led by gv and we’re spending the capital on everything from licensing to manufacturing and distribution to curation twyla is quite a complex operation    we will be doing some marketing but we want to deliver such
