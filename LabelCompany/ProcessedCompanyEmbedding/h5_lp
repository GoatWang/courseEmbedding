as important to us as it is to you and we go out of our way to protect as if it were our own brand controlcontent managementtargeted promotionpremium experience brand controlremember the days when your sales team spent the whole day looking for retailers to sell your products to now your sales staff and anyone else you have had to hire is now trying to figure out who are the retailers that are selling your products where did they get your products and how do you stop them from selling outside of your pricing policies brands now have staff whose job is to police marketplaces and try to keep this under control it starts to feel like a game of whacamole a game in which you knock one critter out and then the next one pops up its ugly head brands are now inundated with tools for managing the whacamole process for a fee you can use their tools to whack the mole if you can figure out who the mole is however the tool does not solve the problem it just helps you play the game no matter what anyone tells you internal or external this problem can be solved this is where the rubber meets the road it takes commitment strength and longterm vision it takes working with a partner who has experience with proven strategies and the stamina and commitment to stay with it if you and your team are truly committed to taking care of this problem and see the impact resolving the problem can
