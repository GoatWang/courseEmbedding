gulf power  and of southern power a wholesale energy company ratcliffe’s tenure  which recently included launching the nation’s first new nuclear reactor project in decades  drew praise from the industry and state civic leaders “david ratcliffe has served the southern company and our entire industry with great distinction for many years” said tom kuhn head of the edison electric institute “he
