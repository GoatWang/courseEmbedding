personality was reflected in the nickname vinegar joe although distrustful of his allies stilwell showed himself to be a capable and daring tactician in the field but a lack of resources meant he was

on march   in palatka florida his parents were doctor benjamin stilwell and mary a peene stilwell was an eighth generation descendant of an english colonist who arrived in america in  whose descendants remained in new york up through the birth of stilwells father named for a family friend as well as the doctor who delivered him joseph stilwell known as warren by his family grew up in yonkers new york under a strict regimen from his father that included an emphasis on religion stilwell later admitted to his daughter that he picked up criminal instincts due tobeing forced to go to church and sunday school and seeing how little real good religion does anybody i advise passing them all up and using common sense instead stilwells rebellious attitude led him to a record of unruly behavior once he reached a postgraduate level at yonkers high school prior to this last year stilwell had performed meticulously in his classes and had participated actively in football as quarterback and track under the discretion of his father stilwell was placed into a postgraduate course following graduation and immediately formed a group of friends whose activities ranged from card playing to stealing the desserts from the senior dance in  this last event in which an administrator was punched led to the expulsions and suspensions for stilwells friends stilwell meanwhile having already graduated was once again by his fathers guidance sent to attend the united states military academy at west point rather than yale university as originally planned despite missing the deadline to apply for congressional appointment to the military academy stilwell gained entry through the use of family connections who knew president william mckinley in his first year stilwell underwent hazing as a plebe that he referred to as hell while at west point stilwell showed an aptitude for languages such as french in which he ranked first in his class during his second year in the field of sports stilwell is credited with introducing basketball to the academy and participating in crosscountry running as captain as well as playing on the varsity football team at west point he had two demerits for laughing during drill ultimately stilwell graduated from the academy class of  ranked nd in a class of  cadets his son brigadier general joseph jr  served in world war ii korea and vietnam military career prior to world war iiedit stilwell later taught at west point and attended the infantry advanced course and the command and general staff college during world war i he was the us fourth corps intelligence officer and helped plan the st mihiel offensive he was awarded the distinguished service medal for his service in france stilwell is often remembered by his sobriquet vinegar joe which he acquired while a commander at fort benning georgia stilwell often gave harsh critiques of performance in field exercises and a subordinate – stung by joes caustic remarks – drew a caricature of stilwell rising out of a vinegar bottle after discovering the caricature stilwell pinned it to a board and had the drawing photographed and distributed to friends yet another indication of his view of life was the motto he kept on his desk illegitimi non carborundum a form of fractured latin that translates as dont let the bastards grind you down between the wars stilwell served three tours in china where he mastered spoken and written chinese and was the military attaché at the us legation in beijing from  to  in  and  he was assistant commander of the nd infantry division and from  to  organized and trained the th infantry division at fort ord california it was there that his leadership style – which emphasized concern for the average soldier and minimized ceremonies and officious discipline – earned him the nickname of “uncle joe” just prior to world war ii stilwell was recognized as the top corps commander in the army and was initially selected to plan and command the allied invasion of north africa however when it became necessary to send a senior officer to china to keep that country in the war stilwell was selected over his personal objections by president franklin roosevelt and his old friend army chief of staff george c marshall he became the chief of staff to generalissimo chiang kaishek served as the commander of the china burma india theater responsible for all lendlease supplies going to china and later was deputy commander of the south east asia command unfortunately despite his status and position in china he soon became embroiled in conflicts over us lendlease aid and chinese political sectarianism political and personal viewsedit barbara w tuchman records that stilwell was a lifelong republican he retained the family republicanism and joined naturally in the exhilarating exercise of roosevelthating and later at the time of his meeting with roosevelt at home stilwell was a conventional republican who shared the sentiments and adopted the tone of the roosevelthaters in which he was influenced by his brother john an extremist of the species elsewhere she notes that in the view of an unnamed close friend “stilwell was liberal and sympathetic by instinct but he was conservative in thought and politics” tuchman also notes his use in his letters and diaries of a catalogue of now insulting words which she says he used easily and seemingly without pejorative content these included limeys for the english frogs for the french met a frog and his wife on shipboard huns and squareheads for germans wops for italians chinks or chinos for chinese googs for filipinos niggers or coons for negroes while at the end of the war tuchman says he took a harsh pleasure in touring the gutted and burnedout districts of yokohama and staring at the once arrogant japanese now living in shanties of scrap lumber and tin and scratching in the dirt to plant onions his diary entry for  september  in yokohama reads in part what a kick to stare at the arrogant ugly moonfaced bucktoothed bowlegged bastards and realize where this puts them many newly demobilized soldiers around most police salute people generally just apathetic we gloated over the destruction  came in at  feeling fine burmaedit gen frank merrill left with stilwell in burma stilwells assignment in the chinaburmaindia theater was a geographical administrative command on the same level as the commands of dwight d eisenhower and douglas macarthur however unlike other combat theaters for example the european theater of operations the cbi was never a theater of operations and did not have an overall american operational command structure the china theater came under the operational command of generalissimo chiang kaishek commander of nationalist chinese forces while the burma india theater came under the operational command of the british first india command and later allied south east asia command whose supreme commander was admiral lord louis mountbatten the british and chinese were illequipped and more often than not on the receiving end of japanese offensives chiang kaishek was interested in conserving his troops and allied lendlease supplies for use against any sudden japanese offensive as well as against chinese communist forces in a later civil war his wariness increased after observing the disastrous allied performance against the japanese in burma after fighting and resisting the japanese for five years many in the nationalist government felt that it was time for the allies to assume a greater burden in fighting the war however the first step to fighting the war for stilwell was the reformation of the chinese army these reforms clashed with the delicate balance of political and military alliances in china which kept chiang in power reforming the army meant removing men who maintained chiangs position as commanderinchief while he gave stilwell technical overall command of some chinese troops chiang worried that the new americanled forces would become yet another independent force outside of his control since  members of his staff had continually objected to chinese troops being used in burma for the purpose as they viewed it of returning that country to british colonial control chiang therefore sided with general claire chennaults proposals that the war against the japanese be continued largely using existing chinese forces supported by air forces something chennault assured the generalissimo was feasible the dilemma forced chennault and stilwell into competition for the valuable lendlease supplies arriving over the himalayas from britishcontrolled india — an obstacle referred to as the hump george marshall in his biennial report covering the period of july   to june   acknowledged he had given stilwell one of the most difficult assignments of any theater commander stilwell marches out of burma may  arriving in burma just in time to experience the collapse of the allied defense of that country which cut china off from all land and sea supply routes stilwell personally led his staff of  men and women out of burma into assam india on foot marching at what his men called the stilwell stride –  paces per minute two of the men accompanying him his aide frank dorn and the war correspondent jack belden wrote books about the walkout walkout with stilwell in burma  and retreat with stilwell  respectively the assam route was also used by other retreating allied and chinese forces in india stilwell soon became well known for his nononsense demeanor and disregard for military pomp and ceremony his trademarks were a battered army campaign hat gi shoes and a plain service uniform with no insignia of rank he frequently carried a model   caliber springfield rifle in preference to a sidearm his hazardous march out of burma and his bluntly honest assessment of the disaster captured the imagination of the american public i claim we got a hell of a beating we got run out of burma and it is humiliating as hell i think we ought to find out what caused it go back and retake it however stilwells derogatory remarks castigating the ineffectiveness of what he termed limey forces a viewpoint often repeated by stilwells staff did not sit well with british and commonwealth commanders however it was well known among the troops that stilwells disdain for the british was aimed toward those high command officers that he saw as overly stuffy and pompous after the japanese occupied burma china was almost completely cut off from allied aid and materiel except through the hazardous route of flying cargo aircraft over the hump early on the roosevelt administration and the war department had given priority to other theaters for us combat forces equipment and logistical support with the closure of the burma road and the fall of burma it was realized that even replacing chinese war losses would be extremely difficult consequently the allies initial strategy was to keep chinese resistance to the japanese going by providing a lifeline of logistical and air support convinced that the chinese soldier was the equal of any given proper care and leadership stilwell established a training center in ramgarh india  miles west of calcutta for two divisions of chinese troops from forces that had retreated to assam from burma his effort in this regard met passive sometimes active resistance from the british who feared that armed disciplined chinese would set an example for indian insurgents and from chiang kaishek who did not welcome a strong military unit outside of his control from the outset stilwells primary goals were the opening of a land route to china from northern burma and india by means of a ground offensive in northern burma so that more supplies could be transported to china and to organize equip and train a reorganized reequipped modernized and competent chinese army that would fight the japanese in the chinaburmaindia theater cbi stilwell argued that the cbi was the only area at that time where the possibility existed for the allies of engaging large numbers of troops against their common enemy japan unfortunately the huge airborne logistical train of support from the usa to british india was still being organized while supplies being flown over the hump were barely sufficient to maintain chennaults air operations and replace some chinese war losses let alone equip and supply an entire army additionally critical supplies intended for the cbi were being diverted due to various crises in other combat theaters of the supplies that made it over the hump a certain percentage were diverted by chinese and american personnel into the black market for their personal enrichment as a result most allied commanders in india with the exception of general orde wingate and his chindit operations were focused on defensive measures command of the chinditsedit during this time in india stilwell became increasingly disenchanted with british forces and did not hesitate to voice criticisms of what he viewed as hesitant or cowardly behavior ninety percent of the chindit casualties were incurred in the last phase of the campaign from  may when they were under the direct command of stilwell the british view was quite different and they pointed out that over the period from  june to  june calverts th brigade which lacked heavy weapons took mogaung and suffered  casualties  among those of the brigade involved in the operation stilwell expected th brigade to join the siege of myitkyina but michael calvert sickened by demands on his troops which he considered abusive switched off his radios and withdrew to stilwells base th brigade after resting were ordered to capture a hill known as point  they did so but were now utterly exhausted most of them were suffering from malaria dysentery and malnutrition on  july at the insistence of the supreme commander admiral louis mountbatten doctors examined the brigade of the  men present from four and a half battalions only  were declared fit the brigade was evacuated although john masters sarcastically kept the fit men  company in the field until  august the portion of  brigade east of the irrawaddy were known as morris force after its commander lieutenantcolonel jumbo morris they had spent several months harassing japanese traffic from bhamo to myitkyina they had then attempted to complete the encirclement of myitkyina stilwell was angered that they were unable to do so but slim pointed out that stilwells chinese troops numbering  had also failed in that task by  july morris force was down to three platoons a week later they had only  men fit for duty morris force was evacuated about the same time as th brigade captain charlton ogburn jr a us army marauder officer and chindit brigade commanders john masters and michael calvert later recalled stilwells appointment of a staff officer specially detailed by him to visit subordinate commands in order to chastise their officers and men as being yellow in october  after the joint planning staff at ghq india had rejected a plan by stilwell to fly his chinese troops into northern burma field marshal sir archibald wavell asked whether stilwell was satisfied on purely military grounds that the plan could not work stilwell replied that he was wavell then asked what stilwell would say to chiang kaishek and stilwell replied i shall tell him the bloody british wouldnt fight disagreements with chiang and the alliesedit i have waited long for vengeance at last i’ve had my chance i’ve looked the peanut in the eye and kicked him in the pants the old harpoon was ready with aim and timing true i sank it to the handle and stung him through and through the little bastard shivered and lost the power of speech his face turned green and quivered as he struggled not to screech for all my weary battles for all my hours of woe at last ive had my innings and laid the peanut low i know ive still to suffer and run a weary race but oh the blessed pleasure ive wrecked the peanuts face — poem written by joseph stilwell in  after stilwell left the defeated chinese troops that he had been given nominal command of by chiang kaishek chinese generals admitted later that they had considered stilwell as an adviser and sometimes took orders directly from chiang he escaped burma in  chiang was outraged by what he saw as stilwells blatant abandonment of his best army without orders and began to question stilwells capability and judgment as a military commander chiang was also infuriated at stilwells strict control of us lend lease supplies to china but instead of confronting stilwell or communicating his concerns to marshall and roosevelt when they asked chiang to assess stilwells leadership after the allied disaster in burma chiang reiterated his full confidence and trust in the general while countermanding some orders to chinese units issued by stilwell in his capacity as chief of staff an outraged stilwell began to call chiang the little dummy or peanut in his reports to washington peanut originally being intended as a code name for chiang in official radio messages while chiang repeatedly expressed his pentup grievances against stilwell for his recklessness insubordination contempt and arrogance to us envoys to china stilwell would press chiang and the british to take immediate actions to retake burma but chiang demanded impossibly large amounts of supplies before he would agree to take offensive action and the british refused to meet their previous pledges to provide naval and ground troops due to churchills europe first strategy eventually stilwell began to complain openly to roosevelt that chiang was hoarding us lend lease supplies because he wanted to keep chinese nationalist forces ready to fight the communists under mao zedong after the end of the war with the japanese even though from  to   percent of us military aid over the hump had gone directly to the th air force and us military personnel in china stilwell also continually clashed with field marshal archibald wavell and apparently came to believe that the british in india were more concerned with protecting their colonial possessions than helping the chinese fight the japanese in august  as a result of constant feuding and conflicting objectives of british american and chinese commands along with the lack of a coherent strategic vision for the china burma india cbi theater the combined chiefs of staff split the cbi command into separate chinese and southeast asia theaters stilwell with generalissimo chiang kaishek and madame chiang kaishek stilwell was infuriated also by the rampant corruption of the chiang regime in his diary which he faithfully kept stilwell began to note the corruption and the amount of money  in  dollars being wasted upon the procrastinating chiang and his government the cambridge history of china for instance estimates that some – of chiangs kuomintang conscripts did not make it through their basic training with some  deserting and the remaining  dying of starvation before full induction into the military eventually stilwell’s belief that the generalissimo and his generals were incompetent and corrupt reached such proportions that stilwell sought to cut off lendlease aid to china stilwell even ordered office of strategic services oss officers to draw up contingency plans to assassinate chiang kaishek after he heard roosevelts casual remarks regarding the possible defeat of chiang by either internal or external enemies and if this happened to replace chiang with someone else to continue the chinese resistance against japan myitkyina offensive and aftermathedit with the establishment of the new south east asia command in august  stilwell was appointed deputy supreme allied commander under vice admiral lord louis mountbatten taking command of various chinese and allied forces including a new us army special operations formation the th composite unit provisional later known as merrills marauders stilwell built up his chinese forces for an eventual offensive in northern burma on december   stilwell assumed direct control of planning for the invasion of northern burma culminating with capture of the japaneseheld town of myitkyina in the meantime stilwell ordered general merrill and the marauders to commence longrange jungle penetration missions behind japanese lines after the pattern of the british chindits in february  three marauder battalions marched into burma though stilwell was at the ledo road front when the marauders arrived at their jumpoff point the general did not walk out to the road to bid them farewell stilwell awarding medals at myitkyina  in april  stilwell launched his final offensive to capture the burmese city of myitkyina in support of this objective the marauders were ordered to undertake a long flanking maneuver towards the town involving a grueling mile jungle march having been deployed since february in combat operations in the jungles of burma the marauders were seriously depleted and suffering from both combat losses and disease and lost additional men while en route to the objective a particularly devastating scourge was a severe outbreak of amoebic dysentery which erupted shortly after the marauders linked up with the chinese army in india called x force by this time the men of the marauders had openly begun to suspect stilwells commitment to their welfare and no effort to hide their displeasure with their harddriving commander despite their sacrifices stilwell appeared unconcerned about their losses and had rejected repeated requests for medals for individual acts of heroism initial promises of a rest and rotation were ignored the marauders were not even airdropped replacement uniforms or mail until late april on may   remaining marauders attacked myitkyina airfield in concert with elements of two chinese infantry regiments and a small artillery contingent the airfield was quickly taken but the town which stilwells intelligence staff had believed to be lightly defended was garrisoned by significant numbers of wellequipped japanese troops who were steadily being reinforced a preliminary attack on the town by two chinese regiments was thrown back with heavy losses the marauders did not have the manpower to immediately overwhelm myitkyina and its defenses by the time additional chinese forces arrived and were in a position to attack japanese forces totaled some  fanatical japanese defenders during the myitkyina siege which took place during the height of the monsoon season marauders secondincommand col hunter as well as the units regimental and battalion level surgeons had urgently recommended that the entire th be relieved of duty and returned to rear areas for rest and recovery by this time most of the men had fevers and continual dysentery forcing the men to cut the seats out of their uniform trousers in order to fire their weapons and relieve themselves simultaneously stilwell rejected the evacuation recommendation though he did make a frontline inspection of the myitkyina lines afterwards he ordered all medical staff to stop returning combat troops suffering from disease or illness and instead return them to combat status using medications to keep down fevers the feelings of many marauders towards general stilwell at that time were summed up by one soldier who stated i had him stilwell in my sights i coulda squeezed one off and no one woulda known it wasnt a jap who got that son of a bitch stilwell also ordered that all marauders evacuated from combat due to wounds or fever first submit to a special medical examination by doctors appointed by his headquarters staff these examinations passed many ailing soldiers as fit for duty stilwells staff roamed hospital hallways in search of any marauder with a temperature lower than  degrees fahrenheit some of the men who were passed and sent back into combat were immediately reevacuated as unfit at the insistence of forward medical personnel later stilwells staff placed blame on army medical personnel for overzealously interpreting stilwells returntoduty order during the myitkyina siege japanese soldiers resisted fiercely generally fighting to the last man as a result myitkyina did not fall until august   after stilwell was forced to send in thousands of chinese reinforcements though stilwell was pleased that the objective had at last been taken his notes from his personal diary contain the notation boy will this burn up the limeys later stilwell blamed the length of the siege among other things on british and gurkha chindit forces for not promptly responding to his demands to move north in an attempt to pressure japanese troops this was in spite of the fact that the chindits themselves had suffered grievous casualties in several fierce pitched battles with japanese troops in the burmese jungles along with losses from illness and combat exhaustion stilwell also had not kept his british allies clearly informed of his force movements nor coordinated his offensive plans with those of general slim bereft of further combat replacements for his hardpressed marauder battalions stilwell felt he had no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces using the marauders as the point of the spear until they had either achieved all their objectives or were wiped out he was also concerned that pulling out the marauders the only us ground unit in the campaign resulted in charges of favoritism forcing him to evacuate the exhausted chinese and british chindit forces as well when general william slim commander of british and commonwealth forces in burma informed stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn stilwell rejected the idea insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges having made his own long march out of burma under his own power using jungle trails stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief in retrospect his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried army inspector general investigation followed by us congressional committee hearings though no disciplinary measures were taken against general stilwell for his decisions as overall commander only a week after the fall of myitkyina in burma the th marauder force down to only  combateffective men out of the original  was disbanded conflict with general chennaultedit one of the most significant conflicts to emerge during the war was between general stilwell and general claire lee chennault the commander of the famed flying tigers and later air force commander as adviser to the chinese air forces chennault proposed a limited air offensive against the japanese in china in  using a series of forward air bases stilwell insisted that the idea was untenable and that any air campaign should not begin until fully fortified air bases supported by large ground forces had first been established stilwell then argued that all air resources be diverted to his forces in india for an early conquest of north burma following chennaults advice generalissimo chiang rejected the proposal british commanders sided with chennault aware they could not launch a coordinated allied offensive into burma in  with the resources then available during the summer of  stilwells headquarters concentrated on plans to rebuild the chinese army for an offensive in northern burma despite chiangs insistence on support to chennaults air operations stilwell believed that after forcing a supply route through northern burma by means of a major ground offensive against the japanese he could train and equip thirty chinese divisions with modern combat equipment a smaller number of chinese forces would transfer to india where two or three new chinese divisions would also be raised this plan remained only theoretical at the time since the limited available airlift capacity for deliveries of supplies to china over the hump was used to sustain chennaults air operations instead of equipping chinese ground units in  the japanese launched the counteroffensive operation ichigo quickly overrunning chennaults forward air bases and proving stilwell correct however by this time allied supply efforts via the hump airlift were steadily improving in tonnage supplied per month with the replacement of chinese war losses chennault now saw little need for a ground offensive in northern burma in order to reopen a ground supply route to china this time augmented with increased military equipment and additional troops and concerned about defense of the approaches to india british authorities sided with stilwell in coordination with a southern offensive by nationalist chinese forces under general wei lihuang allied troops under stilwells command launched the longawaited invasion of northern burma after heavy fighting and casualties the two forces linked up in january  stilwells strategy remained unchanged opening a new ground supply route from india to china would allow the allies to equip and train new chinese army divisions for use against the japanese the new road network later called the ledo road would link the northern end of the burma road as the primary supply route to china stilwells staff planners had estimated the route would supply  tons of supplies per month using these figures stilwell argued that the ledo road network would greatly surpass the tonnage being airlifted over the hump general chennault doubted that such an extended network of trails through difficult jungle could ever match the tonnage that could be delivered with modern cargo transport aircraft then deploying intheater progress on the ledo road was slow and could not be completed until the linkup of forces in january  in the end stilwells plan to train and modernize thirty chinese divisions in china as well as two or three divisions from forces already in india was never fully realized as chennault predicted supplies carried over the ledo road at no time approached tonnage levels of supplies airlifted monthly into china via the hump in july   tons of supplies were flown over the hump compared to only  tons using the ledo road and the airlift operation continued in operation until the end of the war by the time supplies were flowing over the ledo road in large quantities operations in other theaters had shaped the course of the war against japan stilwells drive into north burma however allowed air transport command to fly supplies into china more quickly and safely by allowing american planes to fly a more southerly route without fear of japanese fighters american airplanes no longer had to make the dangerous venture over the hump increasing the delivery of supplies from  tons in june  to  tons in november  on august   a plane crossed the hump every one minute and  seconds in acknowledgment of stilwells efforts the ledo road was later renamed the stilwell road by chiang kaishek recall from chinaedit with the rapid deterioration of the china front after japanese launched operation ichigo in  stilwell saw this as an opportunity to gain full command of all chinese armed forces operation ichigo was the largest japanese offensive of world war ii designed to liquidate the china affair by knocking china out of the war once and for all that saw some halfmillion men and  tanks supplied by  to   horses dragging wagons and   to   vehicles committed to an operation that overran huge areas of china stillwell clashed with chiang over the question of the city of guilin which was besieged by the japanese chiang wanted guilin defended to the last men while stillwell claimed guilin was a lost cause in his diary stillwell wrote what they ought to do is to shoot the gmo chiang and ho general he yingqin and the rest of the gang stillwell ordered the american troops to pull out of guilin and was able to persuade chiang to reluctantly accept the loss of guilin the clash over guilin was only a prelude to another clash where chiang demanded the return of the y force from burma to defend kunming the capital of yunnan province which was also threatened by the japanese advance after meeting chiang stilwell wrote in his diary that chiang was a crazy little bastard with that hickory nut he uses for a head usual cockeyed reasons and idiotic tactical and strategic conceptions he is impossible stilwell appealed directly to president roosevelt for help with his dispute with chiang and as a result roosevelt sent chiang a message which read i have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to china and to you now when you have not yet placed general stilwell in command of all forces in china we are faced with the loss of a critical area with possible catastrophic consequences roosevelt ended his ultimatum to chiang with the threat to end all american aid unless chiang at once place stilwell in unrestricted command of all your forces general chennault later claimed that stilwell had deliberately ordered sinoamerican forces out of guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force chiang to give up command of his armies to stilwell stilwells diary supports chennaults claim as stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was just sufficient to get rid of the peanut without entirely wrecking the ship it would be worth it going on to write that the entire kuomintang system had to be torn to bits and chiang would just have to go an exultant stilwell immediately delivered this letter to chiang despite pleas from patrick j hurley roosevelts special envoy in china to delay delivering the message and work on a deal that would achieve stilwells aim in a manner more acceptable to chiang stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over roosevelts message i handed this bundle of paprika to the peanut and than sank back with a sigh the harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him it was a clean hit but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech he did not bat an eye the british journalist jonathan fenby wrote about roosevelts letter unless the president was ready for america to take over effective control of china or halt lendlease supplies and abandon the kmt to its fate his stern words merely amounted to bluff seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of china chiang gave a formal reply in which he said that stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified us general to fill stilwells position chiang called roosevelts letter the greatest humiliation i have been subjected to in my life and stated it was all too obvious that the united states intends to intervene in chinas internal affairs chiang told hurley the chinese people were tired of the insults which stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them chiang delivered a speech before the central executive committee of the kuomintang which was leaked to the press which called roosevelts letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept roosevelts demands would make him no different from the japanese collaborator wang jingwei in nanking on  october  hurley reported to washington that stilwell was a fine man but was incapable of understanding or cooperating with chiang kaishek going on to say that if stilwell remained in command all of china might be lost to the japanese before sending his cable hurley showed it to stilwell who accused hurley to his face of cutting my throat with a dull knife on october   stilwell was recalled from his command by president franklin d roosevelt partly as a result of controversy concerning the casualties suffered by us forces in burma and partly due to continuing difficulties with the british and chinese commanders stilwells return to the united states was not accompanied by the usual ceremony upon arrival he was met by two army generals at the airport who told him that he was not to answer any media questions about china whatsoever stilwell was replaced by general albert c wedemeyer who received a telegram from general marshall on october   directing him to proceed to china to assume command of the china theatre and replace general stilwell wedemeyer later recalled his initial dread over the assignment as service in the china theater was considered a graveyard for american officials both military and diplomatic when wedemeyer actually arrived at stilwell’s headquarters after stilwell’s dismissal wedemeyer was dismayed to discover that stilwell had intentionally departed without seeing him and did not leave a single briefing paper for his guidance though departing us military commanders habitually greeted their replacement in order to thoroughly brief them on the strengths and weaknesses of headquarters staff the issues confronting the command and planned operations searching the offices wedemeyer could find no documentary record of stilwells plans or records of his former or future operations general wedemeyer then spoke with stilwell’s staff officers but learned little from them because stilwell according to the staff kept everything in his “hip pocket” reassignmentedit despite prompting by the news media stilwell never complained about his treatment by washington or by chiang he later served as commander of army ground forces us tenth army commander in the last few days of the battle of okinawa in  and as us sixth army commander after the wars conclusion in november he was appointed to lead a war department equipment board in an investigation of the armys modernization in light of its recent experience among his recommendations was the establishment of a combined arms force to conduct extended service tests of new weapons and equipment and then formulate doctrine for its use and the abolition of specialized antitank units his most notable recommendation was for a vast improvement of the armys defenses against all airborne threats including ballistic missiles in particular he called for guided interceptor missiles dispatched in accordance with electronically computed data obtained from radar detection stations in late february  stilwell assumed command of the th army with its headquarters at the presidio of san francisco the th army had been reorganized as an administrative command in charge of army units in the western united states in may  stilwell and his former subordinate frank merrill led two marine platoons in the prison uprising known as the battle of alcatraz deathedit joseph stilwell died after surgery for stomach cancer on october   at the presidio of san francisco while still on active duty he was cremated and his ashes were scattered on the pacific ocean and a cenotaph was placed at the west point cemetery among his military decorations are the distinguished service cross distinguished service medal with one oak leaf cluster the legion of merit degree of commander the bronze star and the combat infantryman badge this last award was given to him as he was dying aftermathedit stilwell’s home built in – on carmel point carmel california remains a private home a number of streets buildings and areas across the country have been named for stilwell over the years including joseph stilwell middle school in jacksonville florida the soldiers’ club he envisioned in  a time when there was no such thing as a soldiers’ club in the army was completed in  at fort ord on the bluffs overlooking monterey bay many years later the building was renamed “stilwell hall” in his honor but because of the erosion of the bluffs over the decades the building was taken down in  stilwells former residence in chongqing – a city along the yangtze river to which chiangs government retreated after being forced from nanjing by japanese troops – has now been converted to the general joseph w stilwell museum in his honor legacyedit a bust of stilwell at the former residence of general stilwell museum in chongqing in her book stilwell and the american experience in china  barbara tuchman wrote that stilwell was sacrificed as a political expedient because of his inability to get along with his allies in the theater some historians such as david halberstam in his final book the coldest winter america and the korean war have theorized that roosevelt was concerned that chiang would sign a separate peace with japan which would free many japanese divisions to fight elsewhere and that roosevelt wanted to placate chiang the power struggle over the china theater that emerged between stilwell chennault and chiang reflected the american political divisions of the time a very different interpretation of events suggests that stilwell pressing for his full command of all chinese forces had made diplomatic inroads with the chinese communist red army commanded by mao zedong he bypassed his theater commander chiang kaishek and had gotten mao to agree to follow an american commander his confrontational approach in the power struggle with chiang ultimately led to chiangs determination to have stilwell recalled to the united states according to guan zhong president of the examination yuan stilwell had once expressed his regret of never having the opportunity to fight alongside the chinese communist army especially with general zhu de before his death stilwell a soldiers soldier was nonetheless an oldschool american infantry officer unable to appreciate the creative developments in warfare brought about by world war ii—including strategic air power and the use of highly trained infantrymen as jungle guerrilla fighters his disagreements with the equally acerbic gen claire l chennault as chennault overvalued the effectiveness of air power against massed ground troops—a fact demonstrated by the fall of the th air force bases in eastern china hengyang kweilin etc in the japanese eastern china offensive of —in stilwells opinion stilwell clashed with other officers including orde wingate who led the chindits and col charles hunter officer in charge of merrills marauders stilwell could neither appreciate the toll constant jungle warfare took on even the most highly trained troops nor the incapacity of lightly armed fastmoving jungle guerrilla forces to dislodge heavily armed regular infantry supported by artillery accordingly stilwell abused both chindits and marauders and earned the contempt of both units and their commanders in other respects however stilwell was a skilled tactician in us armys land warfare tradition with a deep appreciation of the logistics required of campaigning in rough terrain hence his dedication to the ledo road project for which he received several awards including the distinguished service cross and the us army distinguished service medal the trust stilwell placed in men of real insight and character in understanding china particularly the china hands john stewart service and john paton davies jr confirms this assessment arguably had stilwell been given the number of american regular infantry divisions he had continually requested the american experience in china and burma would have been very different certainly his army peers gen douglas macarthur and gen george marshall had the highest respect for his abilities and both saw he replaced gen simon bolivar buckner jr as commander of tenth us army at okinawa after the latters death during the last year of the war however the us was strained to meet all its military obligations and cargo aircraft diverted to supply stilwell the th air force and the chinese in the east left airdropdependent campaigns in the west such as operation market garden woefully short of aircraft although chiang succeeded in removing stilwell the public relations damage suffered by his kuomintang regime was irreparable right before stilwells departure new york times drama criticturnedwar correspondent brooks atkinson interviewed him in chungking and wrote the decision to relieve general stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund antidemocratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the japanese out of china the chinese communists have good armies that they are claiming to be fighting guerrilla warfare against the japanese in north china—actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight generalissimos government forces the generalissimo naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war no diplomatic genius could have overcome the generalissimos basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the japanese atkinson who had visited mao in yenan saw the communist chinese forces as a democratic movement after atkinson visited mao his article on his visit was titled yenan a chinese wonderland city and the nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt this view was shared by many of the us press corps in china at the time the negative image of the kuomintang in america played a significant factor in harry trumans decision to end all us aid to chiang at the height of the chinese civil war the british historian andrew roberts quoted stilwells disparaging remarks about the british war effort in asia to illustrate his strong anglophobia which became a stumbling block to smooth cooperation between us and uk forces in asia the british historian rana mitter argues that stilwell never appreciated that his position as chief of staff to chiang kaishek did not give him as much authority as marshall had in his position as roosevelts chief of staff chiang was the commanderin chief of chinese forces not stilwell and he resisted stilwells initiatives when they involved committing chinese forces to doordie engagements or when chinese troops were removed from his immediate control to bases in india mitter views chiang as correct in attempting to husband chinas resources after the serious losses of  mitter also supports the view that chennault could have accomplished much more had stilwell not diverted a large proportion of lendlease equipment to the chinese troops in india mitter factors in the impact of collaborationist wang jingwei as yet another major force in china stilwells mastery of written and spoken chinese made him the united states default choice for the china command mitter projects that his talents could have been far better employed in north africa as marshall had originally planned in popular cultureedit stilwell is portrayed on
