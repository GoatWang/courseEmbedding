everyone this morning we announced adjusted earnings per share of  for the first quarter a  increase over last year while we continue to operate in a challenging new and news margin environment our ability to drive incremental used sales volumes enhanced fi pvr and grow parts and service enabled us to deliver samestore gross profit growth of  and industryleading margins of  in addition during the quarter we acquired a chevy franchise and an isuzu truck franchise in indianapolis indiana we completed our atlanta nissan realignment with the opening of our cumming nissan add point and we repaid traders  million to our shareholders in summary our adjusted results represent another first quarter eps record and our st consecutive quarter of eps growth now i will turn the call back to matt to brings us through our financial highlights matthew pettoni thanks craig this morning we reported eps of  for the first quarter of  adjusted eps was  a first quarter record and a  increase from last year income from continuing operations for the first quarter of  was adjusted for  of pretax legal settlement benefits or  per diluted share income from continuing operations for the first quarter of  was adjusted for  million of pretax real estaterelated charges or  per diluted share turning to expenses our sga as a percentage of gross profit for the quarter was  up  basis points from last year a significant portion of this was associated with investments and technologies we made to better manage our customer experience and improve productivity for  we continue to expect our sga as a percentage of gross profit to be in the  to  range our floor plan interest expense totaled  million up  from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in the libor rate our tax rate for the quarter was  down  basis points from the prior year period this was primarily attributable to new accounting guidelines related to the tax treatment of stockbased compensation notwithstanding the adoption of these guidelines we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately  over the remaining quarters of  with respect to capital deployment during the quarter we acquired hare chevrolet repurchased  million of our common stock and spent approximately  million in capex for  we plan to invest  million in core capex and an additional  million for the construction of a new facility that will replace an existing leased facility going forward we will continue to seek opportunities to purchase real estate currently under lease and acquire properties in connection with future dealership relocations from a liquidity perspective we ended the quarter with  million in cash  million available in floor plan offset accounts  million available on our used vehicle line and  million available on our revolving credit lines our total leverage stands at x on a net basis our total leverage ratio is x which is at the lower end of our targeted range of  to x going forward were committed to our targeted leverage range while maintaining flexibility to deploy capital on an opportunistic basis and finally last weekend a major hailstorm hit  of our dealership in plano texas while were still working to understand the full impact of the storm more than half of the vehicles were totaled and the damages could range from  million to  million though our insurance policies limit our losses to  million our dealerships were left with virtually no vehicle inventory and it is too soon to say how long it will be before these stores are fully operational again now i will hand the call over to dan to discuss our operational performance dan dan clara thanks matt good morning everyone my remarks will pertain to our samestore performance compared to the first quarter of  unless otherwise stated we delivered a strong quarter we grew our used retail unit sales  drove fi pvr above  delivered a frontend yield of approximately  per car and grew parts and service gross profit  turning to new vehicles saar fell  to  million while our new unit volumes were flat we took market share in almost every brand in our local market from a margin perspective we experienced new vehicle margin pressure across all segments due to aggressive stairstep programs and growing inventory levels in certain brands as a result our margins were down  basis points to  our total new vehicle inventory was  million or day supply at quarterend we were not materially impacted by stopsale vehicles like the industry our new vehicle levels are higher than we would like but we believe they are manageable turning to used vehicles we increased our unit sales  in the quarter with cpo vehicle sales up  our used vehicle retail gross profit was down  due to our decision to trade margin for volume as you are well aware incremental used vehicle sales provide profit opportunities in both fi and parts and service we continue to believe that there is additional opportunity to grow our used vehicle sales our team did a great job managing our used vehicle inventory at day supply we target a range of  to  days which minimizes our risk of major movement in used vehicle valuations overall our business was not materially impacted by stopsale inventory turning to fi our team continues to deliver strong results increased used vehicle sales combined with a  increase in our fi per vehicle retail enabled us to increase fi gross profit  now for parts and service our parts and service business continue to perform well in the first quarter with our teams delivering  gross profit growth this growth was primarily attributable to a  increase in warranty now ill hand the call back over to craig craig monaghan thanks dan looking forward we expect the saar to fluctuate in the low to mid million range despite moderating saar and a difficult margin environment we believe well be able to continue to grow eps the influx of offleased vehicles will allow us to better source inventory and grow our used business we believe our parts and service business will continue to benefit from the growing number of latemodel units in operation and the ever increasing complexity of todays vehicles our ongoing efforts to strengthen our sales process recently renegotiated product contracts and increased used unit sales should continue to drive further fi improvements and finally our strong balance sheet modest leverage levels and over  million of available liquidity affords us considerable flexibility to deploy capital as opportunities come our way in closing we want to thank each of our associates our record results are a reflection of your dedication and hard work and now well turn the call over to the operator and take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from rick nelson stephens investment bank nels nelson i wanted to ask you craig about cpos we saw a higher yearoveryear luxury domestics segments but quite a bit of pressure in the import segments if you could provide some color there is it specific brands or regions that are driving that and any signs that it is going to be stabilized craig monaghan all right yes rick im happy to jump in on that what you see there is a direct reflection of these stairstep programs and very aggressive sales targets in the import brands its where it’s the  i said the pressure is the greatest and thats where were seeing the biggest margin deterioration in some of the other  in the luxury brands we actually have some instances where weve got some product shortages and as a result you see the opposite happen you see some improvement in margins but its really that simple i dont know dan if you have anything to add dan clara no craig the  actually the only thing i would add is were also seeing in some of the imports where theres some clearance of old model that are going up and thats also with the high base supply of those models thats creating additional pressure to the margins nels nelson any comments on the regions where you might be seeing strength weakness and i guess i’m especially interested in florida whats happening there craig monaghan yes rick the regions we didnt see that much variation across the regions i mean theres always some up and downs but broadly speaking i would say our performance was fairly constant across the regions nels nelson and finally if i could ask you for an update on the timeline for recruiting a cfo i thought matt sounded pretty good on the call this morning craig monaghan yes weve got a recruiting effort underway weve talked to a number of very attractive candidates we have one that were specifically interested in and we think weve got a good chance of bringing that to conclusion rather quickly operator next up well hear from irina hodakovsky keybanc irina hodakovsky couple of questions for you gentlemen on the contributions  overall acquisitions and the contributions from the acquisitions you just announced how big are they and then you havent been very active in the acquisition market recently because of the kind of the sellers expectation is this a sign that perhaps this is improving and just your last comment kind of points to that as well can you talk a little bit about the conditions in that market craig monaghan sure let me take a shot at this and maybe matt might be able to have more color as well on the numbers but id start off with broadly speaking when we look at these numbers we focus on the samestores results and so samestore results include the like stores in both periods so theres really no impact of more of these recent acquisitions when we talk about samestore results with respect to the market these were acquisitions that made a lot of sense to us they were in markets that we feel good about markets that we feel are going to continue to grow they were priced right and if we find that it makes sense were going to jump all over them if we could find another hare chevrolettype transaction tomorrow wed buy and as you know our fallback is our own stores new share repurchase and were trading at somewhere around x on an ebitda basis indiscernible surprised that on this quarter indiscernible million dollars of fresh stock thats the price to our stores matthew pettoni irina this is matt when youre looking at the difference between the offstores and the samestores this quarter we had a lot of going on remember last quarter we sold off our arkansas platform and halfway through this quarter we purchased the hare chevrolet and in addition to that later in the quarter we had our new nissan open point in cumming georgia so there was a lot of timing in this quarter we lost a full contribution from the arkansas stores but during the quarter our new initiative started to come on so hopefully as we get throughout the rest of the year well be able to realize the full quarterly potential of those new initiatives irina hodakovsky and can you guys update us on the q auto and the progress there i know youre very paced and careful about the roll out of that initiative a lot of your competitors seem to be entering the used vehicle market and just can you talk a little bit about the results there and how  your plans going forward anything changing craig monaghan yes ill take that one were running the q auto stores as a  as really i would say a discount usedcar store thats supporting just the local tampa market and were trying  i mean fundamentally we keep coming back to roi on everything we do we want to generate the return on the investment were trying to prove that we can make that model economically viable and at this point with just  stores its just not material to our results i dont think theres much to add we continue to work on it but were going to watch and see where it goes operator next up from evercore isi is mike montani michael montani i just wanted to ask if i could first off if theres any incremental color you can share on the import side for new is it one particular brand or is it across basically all the import brands and what are maybe some actions that you all can take moving forward to get a little bit better balance there between volume and gpu pressure craig monaghan well mike thats a big question ill start with that and maybe dan wants to add more but specifically no its not just one manufacturer we see it happening with multiple manufacturers its not just stair steps in some cases its manufacturers are trying to move a lot of inventory to the marketplace and the inventory stacks up in the stores and theres a lot of pressure on the stores to move that inventory and our competitors drop prices in order to move it and we drop prices to match i think longer term our  lets deal with the fundamental issue its theres too much production and its causing these disruptions in the market ill speak specifically to our view on stair steps and these aggressive targets its  there  they cause quite a lot of damage and id break it down maybe into  areas when a store gets a sales objective that it just cant achieve its very demoralizing so it demoralizes our staff i think youre very familiar with the fact that it alienates customers because different customers in the store different times of the months can see vastly different prices and then ultimately it devalues the franchise so i dont believe this will continue for the long term i think its a function where were on the cycle i think when production gets back in line with demand some of this will stabilize but in the time  in the meantime weve got to manage through it and we do our  the best we can on a storebystore basis of balancing volume and margin dan michael montani how much ability do you have to sort of refuse allocation and are you all kind of canceling orders actively as well or is there just not enough potential to do that dan clara mike its dan we do have the ability to decline allocation obviously we manage that on a storebystore basis and we can even get more specific on a modeltomodel basis to that particular store so to answer your question yes we do have the ability and in some instances were exercising that ability michael montani okay just two specific initiative questions one was on the fi per unit obviously a nice gain there and it still looks like you have  to  of upside versus some of your peers so just trying to understand if theres any structural impediments to that or if we can continue to expect the glide pass to continue and then secondly on private label parts obviously autonation has been vocal about an initiative to basically private label their parts and not buy as much from the oem supply chain would you all have any intentions to do something like that if you could share any thoughts there craig monaghan sure mike ill start with the fi you did see improvements see some improvements there i mean fi its very fundamental for us and that we do recognize that some of our competitors do a better job at fi than we do were making progress theres always the bottom  that needs to do better a lot of it boils down to training the processes following the procedures that weve got in place and were just going to stick to it i think the other that happens is when  in our industry when you see a lot of pressure on the front end of the store it seems amazing but the fi side of the business seems to do better and thats really  its really a team process thats happening these days in the store when we sell a vehicle the fi office is working with the desk in order to try to maximize well try a new which we talk about all the time and you do see some shifts when  with that margin pressure from front end to fi let me just stop for a second and see if dans got anything to add to that dan clara no craig i think you covered it very well craig monaghan and then the second question im sorry ive forgotten already michael montani it was about private label parts if you might be able to source those from the vendors directly as opposed to through the oe supply chain craig monaghan we dont see that im not  we just dont see that we wish the guys at autonation well if that adds some value thats something wed think about but thats not  we got other initiatives that were focused on right now operator up next is mike levin deutsche bank michael levin first i just kind of wanted to get your feel for the new gpus at this point do you kind of feel that at this point in the cycle automakers have essentially positioned it such that on the new business youre basically just covering cost and you have to just make money everywhere else is that a fair characterization from your experience craig monaghan well id say its true that were not making anywhere near as much money selling new cars as we used to but i  whether that is an intentional move on the part of the manufacturers to force us to break even in new cars i think i dont know that we can say that i go back to what i mentioned earlier i think were just in a situation today where there is more production than there is demand and until that gets back in balance its  it creates a very difficult environment for us i dont believe that its sustainable long term for the reasons that i stated weve been through this before many times it will eventually stabilize itself but i think if you or i were running the manufacturing facility wed be doing everything we could to maximize the throughput because thats how you maximize your profitability in the near term this policy if you would maximizes profitability at the manufacturer level but in the long term it damages the distribution network and then thats why well come back into balance michael levin got you i mean considering where were on the new business and looking at your experience with q auto and sort of understanding the need for kind of a strong brand have you taken a look at doing any ma of existing used standalone stores that kind of have a presence in certain markets and already have an established brand as a way to diversify your profit base and kind of move more into the used market craig monaghan no were really havent weve got q auto if we can make that work in one of our local markets and like i said earlier i said before by making it work to us that means it generates an roi in excess of our cost of capital if we can make that model work the outlooks in our model if you would we can move that across multiple markets and enjoy some success there but until we see that its viable were not going to put a whole lot more capital into that i would just share with you that the challenges of a standalone used car store are really twofold one youve got to source inventory and two youve got a hanging of paper for a large population of subprime buyers so sourcing the inventory is  its something that’s not that challenging for us as long as you dont get too large because weve got vehicles that were sending to auctions that we could probably retail hanging the paper and a substantial number of your buyers can be subprime we have found in these stores hanging the paper is something that were doing in the marketplace we do not want to retain that risk others have made the decision to retain the risk thats not where we want to go and so were just being careful as we move down this path michael levin interesting i mean in the exposure that you do have in both your franchise stores and in the  q auto are you seeing increasing tightening within subprime from lenders and is that something that could be a headwind in your ability to kind of take advantage of some of the better affordability developing for used dan clara mike this is dan we see that our credit is available out there we have seen a few of the subprime lenders that are maybe getting a little bit more specific on some of the steps that they are requesting to verify employment income levels et cetera but overall the credit is available and it is not impacting us operator next question today comes from james albertine consumer edge research derek glynn this is derek glynn on for jamie so we saw strong fi trends in the quarter can you just give us a sense of the gap between the top fi performance  performers in your storebase relative to say the bottom third of performers just trying to get a better feel for the opportunity here in improving fi for some stores and do you think you could still catch up to the average or the best performers there dan clara derek dan again thats a great question and im going to try to answer it to the best of my ability but as you  because  and the reason i say that is because there is so much that goes into a per retail unit in fi the market could determine that and not to mention the  it is extremely important to have the right individual at the desk with the right training that is able to execute the training  of the time but if i had to give you a range i would say that from the least  the bottom line performer to the top line performer youre probably looking at a spread of somewhere if i had to guess probably  a car but again there could be completely different oems in completely different markets so please keep that in mind derek glynn okay thats helpful and i just also had a followup on the used side of the business i guess with the market as a whole where you see supply relative to demand if you could just help us delineate between those  dynamics just trying to get a sense of how to think about the comp trajectory and whether you think looking out into the future demand could keep pace with what should be a rise in supply in the coming years craig monaghan sure mike – or derek thats a great question and ill give you the way we look at it might be a little different than others but fundamentally the used car market is about  million units its the number of cars coming offlease in theory youre going to bring – not in theory in reality going to bring a lot more cars to market but youre looking at ish million units thatll trade hands in a year we think thats going to create some pressure on used car prices i think thats inevitable but we see it as a trading business we try to be in and out of these cars in  to  days i think dan mentioned it in his remarks if used car valuations fall that means well buy them cheaper or recondition them and then well sell them at a lower price but were just trying to make a spread trying to make our   on a transaction and then move on and get the next one done so for us its really about turn its about velocity of moving that inventory through the stores and as long as the market price for a vehicle it goes up slowly or it goes down slowly as long as theres no major or dramatic shifts in valuations well manage through this its fine we deal with this on a regular basis anyhow because used cars happen to be a very seasonal business we see values fall at the end of the year and then values pick up again in the spring so its something that were accustomed to operator we will now hear from john murphy bank of america elizabeth suzuki this is liz suzuki on for john just on offlease when youre getting these cars back how would you characterize the residual values on the lease agreements versus the market value of those cars and are a lot of lessees coming in under water on their leases and when thats the case are the captives working with you and your dealers to come up with a price for the dealer to buy that car dan clara liz this is dan yes again it depends from a oem manufacturer standpoint were seeing some lessees thats coming back that are under water the good news is we  a lot of the manufacturers have  give us the ability where they come in for a lack of a better term theyll appraise the car and then theyll give us a market value at which we can acquire that car if the customers had enough to repurchase that car after the end of the lease so that is  its good support from our manufacturer partners and it is also allowing us to feed our used vehicle inventory and then turn it into a certified preowned which as i mentioned earlier our cpo growth was very healthy in q elizabeth suzuki great and would you say that you are acquiring a larger same or smaller percentage of those offlease cars than you were say a year or  ago dan clara yes i think that from a percentage standpoint its probably the same what has changed is the amount of cars that were seeing coming to the dealers on a daytoday basis or a weektoweek basis but we have always been aggressive at buying those cars in the past and we will continue to do so elizabeth suzuki great and just one more quick one you mentioned the warranty was up  and i may have missed this in the comments but can you just talk about what drove that significant increase dan clara absolutely this is dan again and ill be glad to answer that question were seeing multiple warranty items out there in the marketplace number one airbag inflators are starting to come in pretty handsomely right now we have a few oems that have a few engine warranty work that is being performed other oems that have dashboards that are being performed so its a little bit of few mixes in there depending on the manufacturer and that is what is driving our  increase in our warranty operator well now go back to irina hodakovsky irina hodakovsky craig just a question for you there is a competitor im sure youve heard coming to market right now discussing ecommerce in used vehicles a lot and much of the investment community is discussing about a potential disruption to the way cars are sold and how much market share can this competitor take can you talk a little bit about what it is that you offer online how is this model different from what you have and what do you see in terms of consumer preferences and just could this be as much of a disrupter as people appear to think it is craig monaghan irina its craig id be happy to answer that question and maybe if i can  i want to answer the question from  feet and i can  just maybe ill share our views and maybe i can share a little bit of data and well see where we go if youve got any followups but i mean i think we all agree this industry is changing and its changing very rapidly and so are we were not very public about what were doing to change our business but i assure you that were making investments every day in technology in the web in our digital capabilities and those investments are baked in our sga so rather than a big oneoff its just something that were doing quarterto quarter the investments are all about improving the customer experience and expediting selfprocess we actually believe that many of the new entrants that are coming to our space are  theyre actually doing the right thing we admire some of the moves that theyre making but i would also say that many of the things that you see them doing is happening in our stores already and maybe i could give you some data points to back that up weve got a  person inhouse digital marketing team that have been in place for almost  years these are the millennials polish concrete floor they wear funky socks but theyre good and theyre having a tremendous impact on our stores  of our advertising spend is now digital our internallygenerated internet leads were up  last year largely as a result of the work this team is doing in the first quarter our website visitor count was up  versus the first quarter last year in this past quarter  of our vehicle sales were initiated in what we call pushstart and thats our online sales tool and id encourage you to go to one of our website in all our stores look at a specific vehicle and click on the button that says buy online and it will take you to our pushstart tool and you will see a sell  an online sales process that in many ways is very similar to what you see carvana doing it wont take you through  of the way through the transaction but it will take you all the way through the sale it will take you through valuations on your trade it will take you through fi product but in many states we still need wet signatures that we need to verify so its not  but it is a huge step in the right direction our online sales are growing at doubledigit rates and were not just working on the front end of the stores were working on parts and services as well and there are  were through that almost a quarter of our parts and service appointment are now scheduled online so i come back to what i said earlier were all about roi sometimes that means we buy store sometimes that means we buy stock but the first place we spend money is always in stores and on technology that we think we need to have in place to grow our business in the future so id sum this all up and say we see the world changing we think theres an opportunity to blend this digital world with the traditional brickandmortar world and those are the things that were working on irina hodakovsky very good just one followup you mentioned there was a percentage of sales that are generated online through the pushstart button what was that percentage craig monaghan  of our sales in the first quarter were initiated in our pushstart tool operator and well take a followup from mike montani michael montani i just wanted to ask if there was any impact on the quarter to profitability from the remaining q auto stores and also if you could talk about just the outlook moving forward if theres a certain period of time where if they dont turn profitable you may look to move in a different direction craig monaghan mike the impact on the q auto  of the q auto stores is completely immaterial were down to  stores i would say its an experiment i think a lot of the things that i just mentioned with our online sales initiatives will play into q auto at some point we like having them there its a place for us to go and experiment we can combine different things we can play with one price i think theyre going to be there for some time but they are  its almost like an rd initiative it is not a drag in any material way on our profitability michael montani okay and then on the service and parts side if memory serves the reconditioning component was actually down a little bit which was surprising just given that the used unit comps were pretty strong so just trying to understand the dynamic there if thats a timing issue in some way that works itself out or whats driving it dan clara mike this is dan ill try to answer that question for you there is  items that are  that affected our reconditioning one is i believe we  and ill probably turn it over here to matt afterwards he can give us some more color but we had to  there was a reserve that we took compared to last quarter and then  so that affected that number and then the other item is the fact that we have had a few stores where we have ventured to go to outsource some of the detail departments for the reconditioning part so that  hopefully that answers your question matt is there anything you would like to add to it matthew pettoni mike ill just add traditionally it does  our reconditioning does mirror our used unit growth and i would expect that going forward we did in the quarter have some other things as dan mentioned but those are pretty small going forward as we do continue to focus on growing and driving used car business one of the reasons we do like focusing on it is because it puts business in our parts and service shops so i would expect that to hold going forward michael montani i dont know if youd care to comment but forgetting about the hailstorm stuff for a minute but as you think about q is there anything you can say from an ebitda standpoint because now youve done these acquisitions are we in a position where the total ebitda can start to grow again at this stage or do we have to wait for some more deals or other things to take hold craig monaghan mike as you know we dont give specific guidance so at that level theres just so many variables that are in play right now i think these margins are the great unknown if margins stabilize i think we could be in an environment where we see ebitda growth if margins continue to deteriorate that makes things much more difficult for us operator your next question comes from chris bottiglieri wolfe research christopher bottiglieri thanks for the commentary earlier on your digital initiative thats really helpful i just had a one followup i dont think i heard you mentioned this but are you still doing  like are you still testing delivery  online delivery to the customer right now craig monaghan yes we  what were finding is that an excess of  of the customers who start down the pushstart path come to the store and take delivery there are some who will ask for the car to be delivered and we will deliver the car we will take the paperwork to them to their home or office wherever it might be and we will complete that transaction remotely but our experience is that is definitely  they are in the minority at this point in time christopher bottiglieri lets say less than  basis points of sales like what has the experience been there are you seeing a return  like for those customers that do choose delivery kind of what has the experience been are you seeing a lot of return rates are you seeing like other issues that are popping up where you dont think this model could be sustainable just kind of curious your thoughts there craig monaghan let me just start and say no this model is very sustainable and it is growing nicely i dont think that theres any doubt in our mind that were not going to be spending more more time on this i think dan can give you some more  dan had a very interesting transaction just yesterday i mean maybe hell share it with us dan clara yes chris ill try to provide more clarity to it but back to craigs point it is very sustainable we continue to see improving and increasing on a daytoday basis and since craig mentioned ill give you some more information on it we just couple of days ago just sold a ill say a bentley to an individual that is moving from australia to savannah georgia and that is the power that this tool brings to us and in addition to that we took a very hefty down payment from that consumer towards the purchase of this car so we see that growing and expanding and were very excited of what the future holds as far as the consumer interaction and their satisfaction with it i have been personally at the stores when transactions take place and customers a either come to pick up the  take delivery of their car or b we deliver their car to their home and in both instances they are very very satisfied the biggest feedback that we get especially when a consumer comes to the store is the amount of time that it saves them throughout the transaction christopher bottiglieri thats helpful and then for you it sounds like you’re doing new as well whats the kind of like the  what do you think the pathway for regulation there looks like right now do you think its something that could be more prevalent or is that going to be kind of a long path to get new car delivery craig monaghan ill jump in were doing new and used right the regulation to the piece that i mentioned earlier where you still need the wet signature and you definitely need to validate the steps or else we just create an fi problem for ourselves down the road with reserves that go bad i dont think its  it would be a lot easier to continue to move forward with this if the states were uniform in the regulations and we could accept digital signatures but that will come i dont think its holding us back at this time id go back to the point  i think the point dan made is very powerful and that is a lot of what this is about is expediting the sales transaction the vast majority of the transaction is completed even before the customer comes to the store so when they get to the store well spend however much time we want with them if they want on the demo but literally if they want to come in sign the remaining paperwork and pick up the vehicle they can be out  certainly they can be out of the store in less than an hour well that wraps up our questions we appreciate you being with us today and look forward to talk to you
