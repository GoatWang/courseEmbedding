tax benefits of irrevocable trust can an irrevocable trust be pierced how to create a valid living trust in illinois when you create a trust you place your assets in it during your lifetime transferring ownership into the name of the trust entity at the time of your death these assets normally pass from your trust to the beneficiaries named in your trust documents if youre not comfortable with this arrangement and want to protect your assets posthumously you can create a descendant’s trust instead when you die assets designated for a certain beneficiary transfer to another trust created specifically for him protect your loved ones by a legally binding will make a will online now trustees if you create a revocable trust you usually act as trustee during your lifetime  you have the power to manage its assets and do with them as you like when you create an irrevocable trust you name another individual as trustee you no longer have any control over the assets placed in it if you create a descendants trust so that your bequest rolls over into it when you die you can name anyone as trustee you can appoint its beneficiary as trustee or you can name someone else to manage it for him in either case your beneficiary descendant still has the use and enjoyment of the assets contained in the descendants trust if you named someone else as trustee that individual can distribute trust money to your beneficiary in monthly increments or the trust can pay your beneficiarys living expenses on his behalf your beneficiary can manage the trust the same way provisions if you name your beneficiary as sole trustee he has the power to close the descendant’s trust and take the money in a windfall unless you include provisions in your trust documents to prevent it you can name cotrustees so neither can act without the consent and cooperation of the other you can also specify in your trust documents that your beneficiary does not have the power to terminate the trust you can provide that principal assets transfer to other beneficiaries of your choice at his death and he cannot close the trust prior to that if you do this you’re assured of keeping your money and assets in the family he cant bequeath the trust assets to someone of his own choosing at his death divorce your descendants inheritance is his separate property in the event of his death or divorce whether it passes to him by trust or will as long as he holds title to the inheritance in his own name his spouse is not entitled to a share of it however it would be very easy for him to take a misstep and inadvertently commingle the inheritance erasing its immunity from marital distribution this might happen if he places his inheritance in an investment account then makes an additional deposit into the account from marital funds if you transfer his inheritance into a descendants trust instead of giving it to him outright this can’t happen it prevents inadvertent mistakes that would allow a portion of your assets to go to your descendants exspouse he doesnt have possession of the entirety of his inheritance to commingle it he has only the incremental trust payments or subsistence protection from creditors the structure of a descendants trust also protects your beneficiarys inheritance from his creditors and money judgments against him just as the assets in the trust cannot become marital property as long as they remain in the trust and are not in your beneficiary’s control his creditors cannot reach them either only the payments disbursed to him are legally his and only that portion is vulnerable to garnishment or seizure by third parties however you must usually assign another trustee or cotrustee to ensure this last wills last will overview last will cost last will

for life insurance trusts  novdec  by timothy h guarefew issues are more complex than those associated with the decisions of whether and when to allocate generationskipping transfer gst exemption to transfers to such a trustcounsel must address a number of difficult issues when a client names grandchildren or more remote descendants as beneficiaries of an irrevocable life insurance trust few issues are more complex than those associated with the decisions of whether and when to allocate generationskipping transfer gst exemption to transfers to such a trust this article analyzes a particular type of trust to show that these issues may in certain cases be resolved rather efficiently by applying the rules set forth in the gst regulationstransfer tax treatment of life insurance to understand the issue one first must understand the transfer tax treatment of life insurance and the irrevocable trusts that individuals frequently use to shield life insurance proceeds from the estate tax in general code §§  and  require that life insurance proceeds be included in the gross estate if the insured decedent possessed any incidents of ownership in the policy during the three years ending on the date of the insured decedents death estate planning lawyers commonly recommend that a client who owns life insurance on his or her life transfer all incidents of ownership in that life insurance to an irrevocable trust so that the proceeds from the transferred policies will not be includable in the clients estate although such a transfer in trust can effectively shield the insurance proceeds from the estate tax the client also must address the gift and gst tax implications of making transfers to the trusttransfers may be made to get an existing policy into the trust to fund the trustees purchase of a new policy or to make premium payments on a policy that the trust owns the client will typically address gift taxes by granting the trust beneficiaries the right to withdraw assets from the trust that way transfers to the trust will qualify as present interest gifts that are eligible for the gift tax   annual exclusionthe gst tax may apply even if the gift tax and the estate tax are avoided for gst purposesthe relevant taxable transfers may occur when contributions are made to the trust or distributions are made from the trust the fact that the proceeds are not taxable in the insured decedents estate will not necessarily ensure that the proceeds are not taxable for gst purposes there is an annual exclusion for gst purposes but it applies to transfers in trust only in very limited circumstances which are discussed below if distributions from an irrevocable life insurance trust will be made to skip persons such as the grandchildren or more remote descendants of those who are making the transfers in trust gst tax must be paid unless the trust itself is exempt from the gst tax as a result of an allocation of gst exemptionhypothetical trust for purposes of discussion this article assumes an irrevocable life insurance trust naming grandchildren as the beneficiaries of a specific portion of the trust the trust owns life insurance on a clients life and provides for the distribution of the trust assets at the clients death as follows onefifth in equal shares to the clients thenliving grandchildren and fourfifths to the clients thenliving descendants per stirpesthe particular portions onefifthfourfifths are not important but the structure of the trust is after the clients death the trust agreement allows the trustee to hold any assets that would otherwise be distributed to a minor beneficiary in a vested trust for that beneficiary the assets in any such vested trust would be distributable to the beneficiarys estate if the beneficiary were to die before reaching the clients chosen age of distribution if none of the clients grandchildren survive the client the grandchildrens portion of the trust would be distributed to the clients then living descendants per stirpesgst tax many clients intend for a life insurance trust to meet the single tax objective of excluding the life insurance proceeds from the clients gross estate for estate tax purposes a client could meet this objective by transferring ownership of the policy to the intended beneficiaries practical concerns can arise however when multiple beneficiaries are involved certain beneficiaries are minors or there is the prospect that one or more beneficiaries might not be responsible enough to maintain the policy the hypothetical trust described above would resolve these concerns and divide the proceeds as the client deemed proper between grandchildren as a class and children as a class with the appropriate contingent beneficiaries in each casecontributions to a life insurance trust to pay premiums on a policy that the trust owns will be eligible for the gift tax annual exclusion by use of crummey withdrawal rights nevertheless the contributions will not be eligible for the gst tax annual exclusion because the trust will not meet the requirements of code § c section c dictates that a transfer to a trust will not be eligible for the gst annual exclusion unless the trust has only one beneficiary and the trust assets will be includable in that beneficiarys gross estate if the beneficiary dies before the trust terminates in effect § c requires a separate trust for each grandchild beneficiary this discussion assumes that the client prefers not to split the ownership of the policy among several trusts and that the client does not want to incur the costs and administrative burdens associated with the creation of one trust for children and separate trusts for each grandchild therefore to shield distributions from the single trust to grandchildren or more remote descendants from the gst tax gst exemption must be allocated to the trustalthough the analysis is complex the net result of applying the rules contained in the regulations is simple a portion of any transfer to the trust equal to the portion of the trust assets that will be set aside on the clients death for the grandchildren will be treated as a direct skip to which gst exemption will be automatically allocated in the case of the hypothetical trust onefifth of any contribution to the trust will be treated as a direct skip to which gst exemption is automatically allocated the analysis proceeds as followsseparate share rules under the separate share rules the trust may be considered as two separate trusts one for grandchildren as a class and the other for descendants as a class treas reg § a provides if property s held in trust the allocation of gst exemption is made to the entire trust rather than to specific trust assets this provision appears to prohibit the allocation of gst exemption to part of a contribution to an irrevocable insurance trust gst exemption however may be allocated to part of a contribution to this hypothetical trust if the trust can be treated as two separate trusts and if any single contribution to the trust can be treated as a pair of separate contributions to two separate truststreas reg § ai provides if a single trust consists solely of substantially separate and independent shares for different beneficiaries the share attributable to each beneficiary or group of beneficiaries is treated as a separate trust for purposes of chapter  treas reg § a example  then providest transfers  to a trust under which income is to be paid in equal shares for ten years to ts child c and ts grandchild gc or their respective estates the trust does not permit distributions of principal during the term of the trust at the end of the year term the trust principal is to be distributed to c and gc in equal shares the shares of c and gc in the trust are separate and independent and therefore are treated as separate truststhe example in the regulations is very similar to the hypothetical trust considered here therefore it is proper to treat the life insurance trust as two separate trusts for purposes of allocating gst exemption one for the grandchildren which consists of onefifth of the trust assets and one for the children or the descendants per stirpes which consists of fourfifths of the trust assets note that the regulations provide that the share attributable to each beneficiary    is treated as a separate trust for purposes of chapter  no election need be made to treat a separate share as a separate trustthe example in the regulations assumes that each beneficiary will receive a fractional portion of the trust income which is the same as that beneficiarys fractional portion of the remainder interest both the child and the grandchild received onehalf of the trust income and each will receive onehalf of the trust assets remaining at the end of the  year term under a typical life insurance trust agreement a beneficiary will have no right to distributions from the trust during the clients lifetime except to the extent that the beneficiary exercises the crummey withdrawal right that might be granted to him or her to ensure that transfers to the trust qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion based on the example in the regulations the irs could argue that the grandchildrens portion of the trust is not a separate share because the beneficiaries of one share might invade the other beneficiaries share by exercising their withdrawal rights counsel may address this problem by carefully drafting the withdrawal provisions so that a child with a withdrawal right cannot invade the grandchildrens portion of the trust and a grandchild cannot invade the childrens portiondirect skip the part of the trust that is treated as a separate trust for the grandchildren is a skip person therefore any contribution to the trust is in part a direct skip treas reg § a provides if property is transferred to a trust the transfer is a direct skip only if the trust is a skip person treas reg § d then provides that a trust is a skip person ifii no person holds an interest in the trust and no distributions other than a distribution the probability of which occurring is so remote as to be negligible including distributions at the termination of the trust may be made after the transfer to a person other than a skip person for this purpose the probability that a distribution will occur is so remote as to be negligible only if it can be ascertained by actuarial standards that there is less than a  percent probability that the distribution will occurtreas reg § e provides that an interest in a trust exists if a personi has a present right to receive trust principal or incomeii is a permissible current recipient of trust principal or income and is not described in section a oriii is described in section a and the trust is a charitable remainder annuity trust or unitrust   under the separate share rules it is proper to treat onefifth of the trust as a separate trust for purposes of the gst tax that portion of the trust is a skip person because no individual or entity has any interest in that portion of the trust except to the extent that a crummey withdrawal right is exercised during the clients lifetime and after the clients death all assets in that portion of the trust will be distributed to the clients grandchildren who are all skip persons if   all of the clients grandchildren are dead at the time of the clients death the assets in this portion of the trust will be distributed to the clients descendants per stirpes this may result in a distribution to nonskip persons if the client has several grandchildren however the probability that all grandchildren will predecease the client will in most cases be so remote as to be negligiblejust as a childs ability to invade the grandchildrens portion by exercising a crummey withdrawal right could jeopardize separate share treatment that right could also jeopardize the status of the grandchildrens portion of the trust as a skip person the childs crummey withdrawal right may grant the child an interest in the trust that would make the trust a nonskip person counsel may eliminate this problem by carefully drafting the withdrawal right provisions to ensure that a child may not invade the grandchildrens portion of the trust by exercising a withdrawal rightallocation of gst exemption because a part of each contribution to the trust is a direct skip the clients gst exemption will be automatically allocated to a part of each contribution to the trust treas reg § bi providesif a direct skip occurs during the transferors lifetime the transferors gst exemption not previously allocated unused gst exemption is automatically allocated to the transferred property    the transferor may prevent the automatic allocation of gst exemption by describing on a timelyfiled gift tax return the transfer and the extent to which the automatic allocation is not to applythus unless the client undoes any automatic allocations of gst exemption by filing gift tax returns all transfers to the separate trust for the grandchildren will have gst exemption allocated to them and the separate trust for the grandchildren will have an inclusion ratio of zero unless the clients exemption has been exhausted before a transfer is madesome clients may not desire the result that the regulations impose which is mandatory for the hypothetical trust described here in some cases it may be desirable intentionally to allocate gst exemption late after the gift tax return is due for the year in which the transfer is made to minimize the gst exemption that is used in those cases when a late allocation is permissibly made gst exemption is allocated based on the value of the property in the trust at the time of the allocation rather than the value of any prior transfer in trust a permissibly late allocation of gst exemption would be useful if the value of the life insurance policy that the trust owns on the date of the late allocation is less than the value of the contribution to the trust to make the premium payment the opportunity available to trusts that own term life insurance to leverage the gst exemption by making a late allocation however is not available to the direct skip grandchildrens trust described herefor direct skip trusts the regulations eliminate entirely the opportunity to allocate late if a client fails to take any action the allocation is automatic to the extent that the allocation is undone by the clients timely filing of a gift tax return the grandchildrens portion of the trust will have an inclusion ratio other than zero for gst purposes in either case treas reg § bii provides that the automatic allocation of gst exemption or the election to prevent the allocation if made is irrevocable after the due date for the gift tax return that would otherwise report the transfer in trustit is also important to note that the efficient result described in this article will not protect distributions to grandchildren or more remote descendants that might be made from the fourfifths of the trust that will pass to the clients descendants per stirpes such a distribution would occur if a child predeceased the client as to the portion of the trust that is set aside for the clients descendants the estate planner must advise the client of the benefits gst exempt distributions and burdens possibly wasting gst exemption of affirmatively making an allocation on a timely or late gift tax return gst exemption will not be allocated automatically to this portion of the trust because this portion of the trust is not a skip person and transfers to it are not direct skips a complete discussion of the decisions that must be made in allocating gst exemption to life insurance trusts that are not skip persons is beyond the scope of this article but it is included in jon j gallo the use of life insurance in estate planning a guide to planning and draftingpart ii  real prop prob  tr j   conclusion the gst regulations contain rules relating to the automatic allocation of gst exemption counsel should consider the application of those rules to transfers in trust when drafting life insurance trusts for the benefit of grandchildren or more remote descendants with a properly designed trust a client may eliminate the need to
