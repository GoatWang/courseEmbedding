dish networks charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood  hollywood reporter the hollywood reporter dish networks charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood  pm pdt  by eriq gardner facebook twitter email me print comments his company has been labeled the worst place to work in america hes being sued by all four networks and his adskipping hopper could decimate tv industry economics as thr examines the troubling potential outcome of the entertainment business ugliest fight this story first appeared in the april  issue of the hollywood reporter magazine in  a few months before charlie ergen cofounded the company that would become dish network he and a gambling buddy strode into a lake tahoe casino with the intention of winning a fortune by counting cards ergen then  had bought a book called playing blackjack as a business and studied the cheat sheets unfortunately for him a security guard caught his pal lipsyncing numbers as the cards were dealt the two were kicked out and subsequently banned from the casino more than three decades later ergen now  again stands accused of cheating the house  but this time the house is here nestled in the confines of executive suites from burbank to beverly boulevard and now ergens englewood cobased dish network the nations thirdlargest satellitecable tv provider a public company thats grown from a  startup to an empire with  million subscribers and  billion in annual revenue is the entertainment industrys enemy no  with increasing frequency ergen has engaged in ugly highstakes games of chicken with hollywood in his brutal battle over ballooning carriage fees with amc he dropped the walking dead and mad men network from the dish system for months he also has spent years fighting with broadcasters over the practice of distantly retransmitting tv signals without a license and even was caught violating a promise to stop that he made under oath  all while dish was named americas worst company to work for by a watchdog website but all that was just preamble to the hopper photos the dead and the red the walking dead cast in character and on the red carpet in january  dish introduced the proprietary dvr service that allows consumers to autohop or watch the entire primetime lineup of the broadcast networks commercialfree without even having to fastforward through ads immediately after its introduction cbs nbc abc and fox filed lawsuits arguing that dish if allowed to continue offering the hopper will put them out of business the networks want a judge to grant an injunction and fox is appealing the denial of a shutdown while making a renewed attempt to enjoin the hopper  after dish added mobile capabilities amid the legal challenge ergen who is married with five kids and has seen his personal net worth swell to an estimated  billion making him th on the most recent forbes list of richest people expresses confidence that he will win the legal fight and says it is time that the broadcasters get on board some people are averse to change but the advertising model is going to change with or without the hopper he recently told analysts what were saying to the broadcasters is theres a way for you not to put your head in the sand  the broadcasters reject the assessment services like hopper that undermine the economic fabric of our business arent just illegal they potentially destroy our ability to give the public what it wants cbs chairman and ceo leslie moonves tells thr adds nbc broadcasting chairman ted harbert i think this is an attack on our ecosystem not surprisingly hopper has become extremely popular the year before dish began offering the service for free to customers the company lost  subscribers since then dish added back  were a little bit like an indiana jones movie a sanguine ergen said about his company at the all things digital conference feb  were always in trouble we always get out of it were always going from alligators to guys with arrows to snakes we want to win ergen declined comment for this piece story dish networks charlie ergen made m in total compensation in  at a time when big four broadcast network ratings have hit historic lows with fox down  percent this season and nbc being beaten in the to demo by univision during the february sweep its hard enough to pitch advertisers on delivering eyeballs to ads  as the nets will do in may at the annual  billion upfront presentations its even harder when a major satellite carrier is touting its ability to completely eliminate commercials from the viewer experience networks hope that if research agencies like nielsen start placing emphasis on those who watch programming a week after an initial live telecast it will help keep advertisers in line but analyst richard greenfield asks c vs c who is kidding whom about watching commercials during dvrd programming interestingly such tv carriers as time warner cable and directv though presumably in possession of the same technological capability have not provided products that have triggered such industry venom maybe theres a reason for that ergen has presented hopper as a consumer right while simultaneously telling analysts that programmers have devalued content by making tv shows available on netflix and suing espn for among other things allowing streaming cbs is trying to rescind its licensing contract with dish by claiming that ergen and his top lieutenants fraudulently hid their plans for the hopper in contract meetings in  and in february dish claimed cbs forced the big bang theory actress kaley cuoco to delete a sponsored tweet endorsing hopper even though there was no evidence the actress was pressured at a march event honoring moonves cuoco announced i would like to take this opportunity to say one thing leslie f the dish network as hollywood reluctantly enters the digital age new players like barry dillers aereo tv service are challenging traditional revenue streams and squaring off against the networks in court dillers aereo survived an initial legal challenge april  when an appeals court allowed it to stay in business at least until a trial even among these threats though dish represents perhaps the most aggressive and wellfunded disrupter and its controlled by a man who has the money and inclination to take the fight to its legal and for hollywood very scary conclusion yes hes known by some within his organization to be a pennypinching loudmouth they treat their employees like slaves says one online employee review but its one thing to scream at underlings and install a scanning device to police tardiness yes he really did that its quite another to destroy evidence and mislead judges in a courtroom  dish has been sanctioned for such behavior story espn ordered to pay dish network  million for breach of contract its all enough to ask if charlie ergen is the most hated man in hollywood what should the industry do about him ergen now is gearing up for a fight that could answer that question in september a licensing agreement expires between dish and the walt disney co the coming talks between the companies represent the first major negotiation since the introduction of the hopper disney hardly wishes to bless a tech product like the hopper by renewing its deal with dish but its nearly impossible for a media company to walk away from the billions of dollars ergen is paying for programming pagebreak this friendandfoe dilemma is the essential conundrum dish presents six months before its deal with disney was set to expire dish wasnt at any negotiation table but rather in a courtroom taking disneys espn unit to trial for allegedly offering dish competitors better prices naturally ergen has been hailed as a hero by consumer advocates who appreciate his willingness to toy with a tv model that has become sacred to hollywood conglomerates when it comes to trying out new things and keeping costs down in a competitive market you need a firstmover like dish says john bergmayer at public knowledge a notforprofit rights organization notes vijay jayant an analyst who has been following dish for years at isi group charlies attitude is at some point theyll negotiate with me on my terms hes bluffing until hes not story dish network to write down  million for blockbuster uk if dish exihibits a special form of aggression observers credit this to its billionaire founder and his companys precarious position in the competitive videodistribution industry charlie ergen was born in tennessee to a physicist father who is credited as coining the phrase china syndrome to describe the containment shortcomings of a nuclear reactor accident after playing small forward on the state universitys basketball team charlie earned a business degree from wake forest university in  then worked as a financial analyst at fritolay two years later at  he stunned his family by retiring  or rather he took advantage of the discounts his future wife cantey mcadam got working as a flight attendant to travel the world he also fiddled with becoming a professional poker and blackjack player then in  his buddy jim defranco told him about a big satellite dish getting signals from outer space according to a wake forest commencement address ergen gave in  together with defranco and mcadam the three sank  of their personal savings into a suburban denver startup called echostar an avid mountain climber who has scaled mount kilimanjaro and mount everest ergen steadily has grown his business  now officially known as screamingallcaps dish  into one of the  largest corporations in the world averaging about  billion in annual profits ergen controls  percent of voting power at the company dish thrived in large part by focusing on the hilly rural areas of the country where cable tv lines did not run  and of course a willingness to brawl with anyone getting in the way dish employees adversaries and analysts say no one exploits the judicial system like ergen does to gain a competitive advantage a judge a decade ago noted that ergen had violated a pledge made under penalty of perjury to stop distantly retransmitting local tv signals an appeals court wrote in  that there was no indication that echostar was ever interested in complying with the satellite home viewer act and added we seem to have discerned a pattern and practice of violating the act in every way imaginable story trial begins in dish networks  million lawsuit against espn during the mids when ergen was fighting tivo over who owned rights to dvr technology not only did tivo convince a court that dish had violated a patent but the judge in the case found it distasteful that ergens company would engage in an ad campaign that touted its dvrs as better than tivo while continuing to infringe tivos patent in  dish officially was sanctioned by the court the parties later settled perhaps most notoriously there were the irate judges who officiated dishs recent battle with cablevisionamc after dish terminated a year deal to carry the voom networks a suite of  littlewatched hd channels such as kung fu hd and film fest hd in the early days of the case dish was penalized for bad faith or gross negligence in the destruction of internal company emails a visibly angry new york supreme court judge richard lowe later threatened to launch an investigation unless dish documents were turned over the suit became so ugly that at one point dish executive carolyn crawford hit the father of the opposing sides lawyer on her way out of the courtroom she later apologized in open court in a sexual harassment case in maryland in  a judge wrote that echostar was guilty of gross spoliation of evidence in a  trademark dispute a judge said of dish lawyers that he had never encountered such divisiveness or contentiousness in his  years on the bench most corporations have an institutional bias against litigation and see it as necessary evil says one network insider but for charlie thats how he likes to run his company youll never see him suing in his home state though their name is mud in colorado judges are on to them in fact when dish filed suit in may  in an attempt to beat broadcasters to court and have a judge declare the hopper legal it did so in new york story cbs seeks to unwind retrans agreement with dish network dish continues to be pugnacious at every turn the federal trade commission and justice department are jointly pursuing a lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating telemarketing sales rules by placing unwanted calls to millions of consumers dish also uses every opportunity it has to tout its hopper as the tech product so great that the networks wont let anybody hear about it even while telling judges that the hopper is not so different from other dvrs ambush spin is common at dish on industry news websites employees regularly leave comments meant to slyly promote dish services one writer at allthingsd was so fed up that in  he penned a column titled dear dish network your spam makes me sad please stop the press release issued by dish in the kaley cuoco flap is another example there was no source of the alleged cbs demand to delete her tweet and cbs flatly denied it pushed to corroborate such an allegation dish spokesman john hall will only say we were contacted by someone close to the situation who told us that cbs asked her to remove the tweet barbara roehrig worked at echostar during the mid’s and was the companys first female senior executive she remembers constantly sparring with ergen who sometimes would threaten to walk into a room and fire all the employees he called the craziness pack the modus operandi is yelling there and it takes a toll says roehrig adding that she still stays in touch with many in dishs middle management who refuse to ascend to the companys executive ranks because of the emotional turmoil that it brings weve all been in the line of charlies ranting pagebreak dish was named americas worst company to work for by the website  wall street based on scathing reviews on the job site glassdoorcom employees have been subjected to badge reports where they are redflagged for showing up minutes late when they travel staffers are asked to take redeye flights share hotel rooms and reimburse the company if they tip more than  percent one fieldservice specialist tells thr in my office you are not even allowed to use the restroom in the mornings before leaving on your route or in the evenings until youre off the clock a dish rep says the company abandoned its badge reports in january and disputes that employees are forced to take redeye flights and arent allowed bathroom breaks after dish was hit with bad press management attempted to intervene dish ceo joe clayton sent employees an email that stated in part if you are happy here at dish and believe the company is moving in the right direction log on to glassdoorcom and provide feedback at dishs colorado headquarters company leaders shoot down questions about whether dish truly is the meanest of mean companies i think it is a challenging place to work admits dave shull a dish senior vp in charge of content acquisition deals he says its common for meetings to get animated but embraces the companys aggressive ethos you can always be a follower a slave to competition and hope for the best says shull or you can lead the charge try to expand market share and innovate when you ski or ride horses what happens when you sit back is that you lose control we lean in story cbs chief leslie moonves involved in decision to revoke ces award to dish networks hopper after several years of growth dish like the rest of the cable and satellite industry has been facing new challenges in  pay tv providers added only a few tens of thousands of subscribers according to analyst estimates and the overall trajectory isnt good in reaction dish has been aggressive in keeping customer bills lower than those of its rivals dishs subscriberrelated expenses increased to  billion in  up  percent from the previous year which the company attributes to rising programming costs by comparison directv spent more than  billion on programming in  and another  billion on service about a  percent increase id venture to guess that dishs programming increases are among the lowest in the business says jayant still that might not be enough dish now competes with such internetbased tv services as netflix and hulu subscribing to both costs only about a third of the  for a basic dish package as well as webandtv combos offered by the likes of time warner cable and comcast unlike its rivals dish has struggled to expand into businesses other than satellite tv service in  it completed an acquisition of blockbuster but couldnt leverage the brand into a viable netflix competitor dish has been attempting to do more with its wireless spectrum assets which it has paid roughly  billion to acquire but has been frustrated by fcc roadblocks the company lately has been attempting to get a wireless network service off the ground holding talks with google and making an aggressive bid to acquire part of g network pioneer clearwire corp for now though dish remains a onetrick pony in the words of analyst jayant unlike comcast it doesnt create any programming itself unlike time warner cable or verizon it isnt able to offer triple play of televisioninternetphone service what it has is the hopper which leads one lawyer defending the networks to conclude ergen would rather ask for forgiveness than permission some legal observers believe that dish will succeed in court in november a federal judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the hopper and said that fox faces an uphill road in arguing that dish has committed copyright infringement and breached its contracts with the network the judge wasnt totally convinced of the legality of dishs system however and some attorneys believe the broadcasters ultimately will prevail i think a court is going to side with the networks because of the economics though a new legal test might need to be fashioned because this doesnt fit the usual standards says bryan sullivan at early sullivan story dish network makes  billion bid to buy clearwire corp as the lawsuit plays out dishs ability to stay in the game might depend on the outcome of coming carriage negotiations ergen will be making a multibilliondollar bet that disney cant afford to walk away from dishs  million subscribers but if it signs a new deal it will send a signal that broadcasters have been a tad hyperbolic when it comes to the threat they allege the hopper to be if the offer is not right dish could head down a new path it might stream disneys abc anyway without a contract but in partnership with a company like dillers aereo whose own technology of capturing overtheair tv signals and transmitting them privately online likely will be hashed out in a messy trial dish and aereo reportedly have held talks with each other recently or dish could abandon the quickly growing cost of licensing espns live sports to further position the satellite distributor as the cheap alternative in the marketplace but thats undoubtedly risky analysts are getting a little edgy on a recent earnings call dishs management was asked to address whats going to happen we are a big customer of disneys answered clayton i would not expect them to take it down with the autohop as the reason added ergen our checks are pretty big dish pays disney roughly  billion a year for espn alone but thats not quite enough to settle the analyst community i have no idea what is going to happen admits jayant as the recent dishespn lawsuit highlighted thanks to most favored nation provisions which guarantee that no rival will get a better deal subscriber rates are intertwined throughout the tv industry if disney accepts less than market value from dish it likely will have to give discounts to other distributors too and walking away from dish might not necessarily mean losing all  million pay tv consumers if some of them defect to rival services a recent survey by lazard capital found that  percent to  percent of pay tv subscribers would cancel or switch their service if they lost a top broadcast network and  percent would cancel if they lost espn if anything contents leverage over distributors is strengthening concludes analyst barton crockett story ces dish network ups ante with new hopper features the last time disney and dish made a deal in  the negotiations took a year now theres just a few months until the license expires in september and the very dealmakers who will be meeting with one another just sat uncomfortably side by side for three weeks in a courtroom disney declines comment about whether it would look past the hopper whose legality likely will not be settled before the two sides need to make a deal a disney spokesperson says any renewal with dish would be consistent with established marketplace terms dishs shull wont say whether ergen or his execs have met with disney but says he hopes that the two companies will be able to work out their differences is ergen about to get comeuppance for his nasty behavior or will broadcasters bow to what many believe is the inevitable evolution of the ad business by years end the outcome of the disneydish negotiations could signal where the industry is headed for some folks it becomes personal says shull for me its business theres always some difference of opinion but with billions of dollars at stake greed usually wins out facebook twitter email me print comments eriq gardner email protected eriqgardner comments comments powered by disqus   data dumps    freebase api
