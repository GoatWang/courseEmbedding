risk including potential loss of principal investment considerations there can be no guarantee that any strategy will be successful all investing involves risk including the potential loss of principal certain risks related to an investment in the fund are summarized here equity securities risk equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer frontier markets risk frontier market countries are emerging market countries but generally have smaller economies or less mature capital markets than more developed emerging markets and as a result the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier countries the markets of frontier countries typically have low trading volumes and the potential for extreme price volatility and illiquidity this volatility may be further heightened by the actions of a few major investors for example a substantial increase or decrease in cash flows of mutual funds investing in these markets could significantly affect local stock prices and therefore the net asset value of fund shares these factors make investing in frontier countries significantly riskier than in other countries including other emerging market countries and any one of them could cause the net asset value of the fund’s shares to decline focused investment risk focusing a fund’s investments in a limited number of issuers sectors or industries increases risk and the volatility of the value of a fund’s shares the fund may be particularly susceptible to economic political regulatory or other events affecting the issuers sectors or industries to the extent it focuses its investments liquidity risk illiquid securities and other instruments may be highly volatile difficult to value and difficult to sell or close out at favorable prices or times before investing you should carefully consider the funds investment objectives
