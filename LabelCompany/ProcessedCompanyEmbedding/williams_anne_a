beauty by dr kari williams beautyhairreviews june    comments in the course of this blogging career i’ve had the pleasure and privilege of meeting some amazing people who spread love knowledge and beauty one of the most amazing is dr kari williams hairstylist and trichologist to the stars she’s based in los angeles and her client list includes some of your favorite singers and tv stars i first met dr kari in  when she visited chicago and ever since then she’s been sharing incredible hair knowledge with me       now that i look back on the things i learned in that first meeting i realize she’s been preaching and teaching some real natural hair truths all along for example ” you know how sometimes you ask someone what products they use in their hair and they’re like “oh whatever a little of this and a little of that” yeah that’s not the best method dr kari believes it is best to have a product regimen including shampoo conditioner deep conditioner a lubricant and a styling product she says staying within a specific product line is best because the product line has been made specifically to work together” “lubrication and oil are important to our hair care after conditioning many oil the scalp or use grease but grease just plasters the flakes from your scalp back down dr kari recommends using a light oil on the scalp but a heavier oil on the ends” “when you think of moisturizing hair think water ingredients in your hair products should include water in the top five ingredients and then oil  jojoba oil is also antibacterial and contains vitamin e” “for caring for locs dr kari recommends hot oil treatments no heavy creams and you should rinse lightly locs hold on to energy love them gently treat them with care” dr kari has been telling me and her message has never changed dr kari effectively taught me the importance of oil to my natural hair’s health so it totally makes sense to me that her brand new product line anncarol beauty has launched with two amazing hair oils   i recently caught up with dr kari on the phone and she told me that it took her two years to produce anncarol beauty there will be more products in store but for now she’s got two amazing natural hair oils that are available for sale her peppermint chamomile oil is intended to soothe and revitalize the scalp and her coconut lavender oil is intended to soothe the senses and reduce frizz – but it also has scalp soothing properties i love multiuse oils and both of her oils can be used for the scalp for the hair for the skin everything dr kari does is infused with her faith and her family anncarol beauty is intended to honor her mother its name is a tribute to her anncarol beauty is intended to include the essentials for women who are going natural or for those who feel overwhelmed by the proliferation of hair products promising the world to all who purchase anncarol beauty is about streamlining the product process it’s not about texture or curl types or false promises it’s about healthy hair period”it’s about simplifying the process i take the approach of the trichologist because the foundation for healthy natural hair extends throughout all hair types” so far so awesome i’m loving anncarol beauty’s hair oils so far and i can’t wait to see dr kari’s line of products grow she’s so knowledgeable about our hair’s needs for more on anncarol beauty visit

forward to trying it afrobella says june    pm dr karis pics make me think about faux locs theyre so pretty and she does them so well renisha says june    pm ok maybe i wont cut my locs off i need
