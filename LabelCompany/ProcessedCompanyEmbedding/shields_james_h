that objective with all of the technological advances over the past century we are literally creating interference that threaten our health and wellbeing that’s why juuva believes in the overwhelming benefits of the cation shield this shield was developed with proprietary advanced technology and contains unique stones and minerals to help protect you from the harmful effects of your electronic devices the stones within the cation shield emit negative ions which provide numerous health benefits healing properties negative ions recovery from physical exhaustion or fatigue – by increasing oxygen levels in the blood and facilitating more efficient oxygen utilization negative ions help accelerate recovery from fatigue stabilizing brain function – by promoting abundant oxygen levels in the blood negative ions help normalize brain function resulting in relaxation and calmness increasing metabolism – by stimulating the exchange of electronic substances in cell walls negative ions help increase metabolism strengthening the immune system – high levels of negative ions promote production of globulin in the blood resulting in stronger resistance to illness balancing the autonomic nervous system – negative ions can calm and relax taut nerves by balancing the opposing sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system promoting better digestion – by counteracting overarousal of the sympathetic nervous system negative ions help ease tension in the stomach and intestines promoting the production of digestive enzymes and enhancing digestion cell

have healed as quickly megan dst george ut defense against the elements ions are invisible particles either molecules or atoms which bear an electric charge atoms for instance consist of an atomic nucleus that contains neutral neutrons and positively charged protons as well as orbiting electrons that are negatively charged when an atom is in a neutral condition the number of protons  and electrons  is equal when the number of protons and electrons is not the same the particle becomes an ion that is either positively or negatively charged generally speaking positive ions are harmful to the human body while negative ions are beneficial  positive ion an atom or molecule that has lost one or more electrons due to a highenergy impact natural forces that generate positive ions include the decay of radioactive minerals radon gas forest fires lightning and ultraviolet rays negative ion an atom or molecule that has gained one or more extra negatively charged electrons negative ions are naturally generated by evaporating water positive and negative ions also exist in our bodies and the ratio of ions in the air we breathe influences the ratio in our bodies ions enter the body through the lungs inhalation as well as through the skin – especially through meridian acupressure points which have weak electronic resistance they then travel through the blood and lymphatic systems to cells throughout the body wearing juuva enerceutical products may increase the number of negative ions absorbed through the skin negative and positive ion levels measured in various locations these measurements were taken in japan inside typical tokyo residences positive ions were found to be  times more numerous than negative ions these findings may be due to inadequate ventilation both in office buildings and energyefficient houses as well as from the use of electronic devices that generate electromagnetic fields and from building materials that emit formaldehyde and other toxic fumes on the other hand high negative ion levels such as at waterfalls hot springs and other highly moist areas will neutralize positive ions leading to very low positive ion levels these measurements suggest that it is difficult to maintain sufficient levels of negative ions in the present age how positive and negative ions affect our bodies effects of cell phone radiofrequency signal exposure on

combination of precious stones and minerals each with unique abilities to consistently target and emit healing properties anion is an ion with more electrons than protons giving it a net negative charge since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged germanium germanium is a semiconductor element germanium has a small band gap that allows it to efficiently respond to infrared light the two important characteristics of germanium that brings about healthy function effects are its natural ability to balance the body’s ions bioelectricity and the penetration of far infrared rays into the human body germanium is a chemical element in the carbon group of metalloids high in antiviral activity it acts as a powerful antioxidant far infrared rays far infrared rays are invisible waves of energy that have the ability to penetrate all layers of the human physical body penetrating into the innermost regions of the tissues muscles and bone far infrared therapy involves the use of far infrared rays to gently heal soothe stimulate and detox the physical body as well as the mind scalar energy scalar energy can regenerate and repair itself indefinitely this also has important implications for the body once the charge is implanted it remains in place with the regular ingestion of charged products scalar energy is also more field like than wavelike instead of running along wires or shooting out in beams it tends to “fill” its environment this becomes very important in terms of developing the technology for embedding products with scalar energy zeropoint energy zeropoint energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have it is the energy of its ground state all quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state and have an associated zeropoint energy a consequence of their wavelike interaction zeolites zeolites are microporous minerals that form where volcanic rocks and ash layers react with alkaline groundwater zeolitebased oxygen concentrator systems are widely used to produce medicalgrade oxygen the zeolite is used as a molecular sieve to create purified oxygen from air using its ability to trap impurities in a process involving the adsorption of nitrogen leaving highly purified oxygen and up to  argon zeolites are also widely used in industry for water purification tourmaline

questions can the cation shield be moved and used on a different electrical device after it has been installed on the initial device ie if i purchase a new cell phone can the shield be effectively

hills utah i enjoy the protection of the cation shield as i ride the bart train during commute hours and everyone has their electronic devices on i wear the shield on a charm bracelet so i have some protection whether i have my cell phone or not darvette amanteca ca i have planter fasciitis by placing several cation shields on the instep of my shoes i find a huge amount of relief from the pain dr mike kportland me prepping for the st george marathon i was running my last long run it was  in the morning i was on mile  out of  when i hit uneven ground i fell and twisted my ankle being out of town and by myself i ended the last  miles hobbling back to the car on a twisted ankle with the marathon just  weeks away i was devastated i had spent  months training for this after meeting with a physical therapist he encouraged me to not run on it i decided to put cation shields in my shoes within a week my ankle was almost fully healed by the time of the marathon it was as good as new i kept the cation shield in my shoes an anion emitter on each hip rejuv zing live and alkaline water in my system i ran that race and beat my previous marathon time by  minutes i believe without the cation shields in my shoes i would not have healed as quickly megan dst george ut   other products     english 繁體 not seeing a scroll to top button go to our faq page for more info back to top cri   shields
