financials excel format includes critical information not found in call reports hi i’m nate tobik founder of complete bank data instant download reports contain over  data points per bank as an investor i struggled for years to find a good source of bank financial data to use for valuations and investment decisions the big companies that sell this information charge thousands a month  a price point that only makes sense for large banks and funds so like most investors my first stop was the fdic’s website and the most recent call reports filed by the banks if you’ve ever downloaded these before you know they’re not exactly “user friendly” some of the issues include difficult to use format call reports only contain aggregate yeartodate information this makes it difficult to see trends and compare bank performance on a quarterly or annual basis even worse the data is presented in pdf format so it must be reentered into excel before being processed visualized or used in any meaningful way impossible to compare and search the call report format makes it impossible to search and compare banks on key metrics like roa nonperforming loans etc it would take hours of work to compare banks on a handful of metrics or even to view one bank’s past performance on a single metric missing holding company data call reports for banks exclude information on their holding companies this can hide assets and introduce serious errors to valuation models for more on the pitfalls of call reports read our whitepaper here in short to get any kind of usable insights from fdic call reports you need to painstakingly enter them into excel and disaggregate the data this process can take days for each bank and the time and cost requirements of doing this quickly add up to limit the number of banks you can analyze in a reasonable period of time frustrated with spending endless hours on bank data entry i created my own solution a completely automated system for obtaining and processing bank financial data introducing completebankdata individual bank reports click here to download a sample report in excel format our team at completebankdata has launched a new service that

elsewhere hi i’m nate tobik founder of completebankdata determine if a bank is safe in seconds to outsiders banks are viewed as black boxes that take unknown and undue risk with depositor money outsiders have trouble determining what a bank is doing the risk it is taking and if a bank will run into financial difficulties the last thing anyone involved with a bank from a depositor to an investor or a vendor wants is to be blindsided by a bank failure to outsiders it even seems like even regulators are even blindsided by failures but here’s the thing it isn’t true banking regulators know for months and sometimes even years that a bank is on the brink of failure the problem is they don’t make this information public because they fear it would cause panic and distress bank regulators use a system called camels which stands for capital assets management earnings liquidity and sensitivity to evaluate the health of a bank the only parties who know camels ratings are bank regulators and bank managements and it’s not in a bank’s interest release these ratings to the public a number of companies that have attempted to reverse engineer the camels ratings used by regulators but reverse engineering has pitfalls any engineer will tell you that reverse engineering anything is filled with problems and hidden issues would you rather drive a car that was designed from the ground up for safety or would you rather drive one where the safety features were reverse engineered if you wouldn’t get into a car with reverse engineered safety features why would you trust a company’s reverse engineered financial safety metrics i know i don’t trust reverse engineering so when we we set out to design a bank safety ratings we decided to design them from the ground up the bank regulator camels ratings might be useful to bank regulators but we’re not regulators and you’re not a regulator either we set out to design something useful to anyone concerned with the safety and financial soundness of a bank whereas the camels ratings rely on six metrics to assess the risk level of a bank we look at  separate metrics giving you a more comprehensive rating these aren’t just simple metrics either we look at everything from a bank’s basic capital soundness to their asset quality trends after looking at an initial set of financial measure we then compare a bank to local peers to determine if a bank is taking excessive risk compared to their peers we created our safety and soundness report as a way for anyone to assess the financial safety of a bank you don’t have a be a regulator to use this report the report contains an overall safety rating right at the top in an easy to read font with color coding a bank is ranked safe moderately safe high risk or very risky beyond the initial safety rating we also include additional financial metrics that support the safety rating the metrics we include are just a portion of the metrics that are used to create our risk scores but they’re vital in helping you assess the financial condition of a bank the report includes  specific metrics including tier  capital ratio leverage ratio noncurrent loansloans loan loss allowanceloans earnings coverage to net chargeoffs loan loss allowancenoncurrent loans total assets net loans  leases total deposits yield on earning assets net interest margin return on equity return on assets you can purchase the safety and soundness report right now for  by following the steps listed below individual reports are  each and come in the form of an instantly downloadable excel file

users only close full excel download questions call     available now individual bank reports with full financials excel format includes critical information not found in call reports hi i’m nate tobik founder of complete bank data instant download reports contain over  data points per bank as an investor i struggled for years to find a good source of bank financial data to use for valuations and investment decisions the big companies that sell this information charge thousands a month  a price point that only makes sense for large banks and funds so like most investors my first stop was the fdic’s website and the most recent call reports filed by the banks if you’ve ever downloaded these before you know they’re not exactly “user friendly” some of the issues include difficult to use format call reports only contain aggregate yeartodate information this makes it difficult to see trends and compare bank performance on a quarterly or annual basis even worse the data is presented in pdf format so it must be reentered into excel before being processed visualized or used in any meaningful way impossible to compare and search the call report format makes it impossible to search and compare banks on key metrics like roa nonperforming loans etc it would take hours of work to compare banks on a handful of metrics or even to view one bank’s past performance on a single metric missing holding company data call reports for banks exclude information on their holding companies this can hide assets and introduce serious errors to valuation models for more on the pitfalls of call reports read our whitepaper here in short to get any kind of usable insights from fdic call reports you need to painstakingly enter them into excel and disaggregate the data this process can take days for each bank and the time and cost requirements of doing this quickly add up to limit the number of banks you can analyze in a reasonable period of time frustrated with spending endless hours on
