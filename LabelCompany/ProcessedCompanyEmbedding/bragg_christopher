privacy statement • contact us   the history of bragg by brian h bragg about the name bragg    two likely origins of the bragg surname have been cited by researchers charles guarino and albert seddons who many years ago distributed a syndicated newspaper column on family names and heraldry in a  column they proposed that one possible origin of the bragg name was a word for describing the character of a person the other possible origin was a fanciful derivation from the name of a scandinavian god in the middle english vocabulary was a word spelled “bragge” which meant lively or vigorous the norman word “braggi” described a man of great accomplishment a hero when a clerk encountered the task of entering into official records the names of two individuals who bore the same personal name he often added such a descriptive word to differentiate between the two thus by the decision of a small town clerk the bragg name was born the norsemen — danes and scandinavians — left a great impact upon the british isles and the process of namegiving their god of wisdom and eloquence was called bragi at scandinavian sacrificial feasts a horn consecrated to bragi was used as a drinking cup by guests who vowed to do some good deed worthy of being immortalized in verse the name bragi was honored as a personal identification and it eventually evolved into a surname bragg is the result in england in heraldry the bragg crest is shown as a silver background with a green chevron surrounded by three red bulls one of the earliest records of a bragg name was made in  when walter bragge a landowner was listed in the assize of sommerset henry brag appears in  in wiltshire the first bragg to travel to the americas is believed to have been thomas bragg who accompanied capt christopher newport on a  voyage to virginia carrying the english emigrants who established the new settlement of james town thomas was reputed to be one of several bragg brothers who migrated from england in the early th century to outposts in colonial north america including massachusetts maine and nova scotia thomas born in england about  was the ggrandfather of the author of this account although no written record of the marriage is known to the author thomas bragg’s spouse is believed by many to have been mary molly newport the daughter of capt newport noteworthy achievers and public figures in america the th century family headed by thomas bragg of warrenton north carolina is probably the most widely known bragg family on this side of the atlantic the family’s second son also named thomas bragg  had a career in public service as a north carolina state legislator a prosecuting attorney the governor of north carolina  and us senator when north carolina seceded from the union at the start of the us civil war thomas bragg left the senate and was later named attorney general of the confederate states of america he had a private law practice after the war the family’s fourth son braxton t bragg  attended the us military academy at west point new york and ranked fifth among the  graduates in the class of  he distinguished himself as a captain of artillery in the mexican war and retired from the military as a lieutenant colonel in  to become a louisiana sugar planter he returned to uniform in  as colonel of the louisiana militia when the civil war erupted and advanced to command of the central armies of the confederacy as a general officer for the confederate states of america gen bragg had mixed success as a field commander scoring some signal triumphs but also sustaining some inglorious defeats he was with csa president jefferson davis when davis was captured by union forces after the war braxton bragg’s plantation was burned during the war and appropriated by outsiders through the carpetbagging politics of reconstruction when the conflict ended braxton finished his life working for others as a civil engineer in louisiana alabama and texas writer and reporter rick bragg born  july  is probably the bestknown american contemporary with the bragg surname he was born and raised in northeastern alabama and worked for several newspapers he joined the new york times in  rick bragg wrote many nyt stories about highprofile crimes including the domestic terrorist bombing of the federal building at oklahoma city the schoolyard shootings at jonesboro arkansas and the notorious murder of her children by susan lv smith in south carolina as miami bureau chief for the times rick bragg covered the tense and volatile  political tugofwar involving custody of the cuban boy elian gonzalez bragg’s work won him the  pulitzer prize for feature writing for his “elegantly written stories about contemporary america” rick bragg is probably more widely known for his books about his family his all over but the shoutin’ and ava’s man both reached bestseller lists he resigned from the nyt in  after he was briefly suspended for writing a feature story which extensively used the notes and reporting work of an unpaid freelancer without attribution acknowledgement or explanation that practice was not uncommon at the nyt and other newspapers and the rick bragg incident might not have risen to public notice except that it occurred during a period when the nyt’s credibility was under a cloud for an egregious case of phony reporting by another byline writer jayson blair — a case which eventually cost two highranking editors their jobs in england the most highly regarded and widely known bragg is arguably the writer broadcaster historian and arts advocate lord

won the prize in  for their research in physics in  the braggs had founded a new branch of science of great importance by developing the use of xrays to analyze the atomic structure of crystals the idea was first promulgated and explored by the son william lawrence bragg when he was just  years old he is still the youngest winner of a nobel prize both father and son were english but the son was

their monumental  discovery of the structure of dna in the arena of commerce the bragg name most often seen by american consumers is on the products of a health food company called bragg live food products based in santa barbara california the companys bestknown product is its organic apple cider vinegar sold by independent and chain foodstores health food retailers and food supplement stores the company was founded by paul chappius bragg born february   in batesville indiana paul c bragg was an entrepreneur whose eagerness for hollywoodstyle selfpromotion led him to fabricate tales about his life and achievements for example in the s and s as a traveling lecturer on healthy lifestyles and evangelist for his own methods paul c bragg added  years to his own age in an apparent effort to exaggerate the benefits of his health regimen he falsely claimed to be a descendant of gen braxton bragg see above though genealogy records show gen bragg and his wife had no children there may be truth in some of the healthrelated teachings of this man who called himself a “life extension specialist” but the details of paul c bragg’s fabrications and hyperbole give us reason for skepticism to this day the bragg company’s promotion leans heavily on celebrity namedropping bragg claimed to have learned his goodhealth techniques while being cured of tuberculosis in a swiss clinic as a young man he claimed to have wrestled in the olympics in  and  fought in all the major battles of world war i played tennis with teddy roosevelt and taught tr’s sons boxing and claimed to have founded the first american health food store in los angeles in  researchers have debunked these tall tales by examining historical records including census social security immigration and selective service records as well as records in ripley county indiana where he was born paul c bragg died in  at the age of  but claiming to be  the face of bragg live food products today is patricia bragg who still clings to the fiction that she is paul c bragg’s daughter actually she was born patricia pendleton in  in oakland alameda county california and was paul’s former daughterinlaw patricia was married to paul’s son robert e from whom she was divorced in  after robert accused her of scandal involving his father christopher a bragg  newcastle me  company information products resources my account talk to
