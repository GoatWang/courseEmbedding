pitney aif senior vice president and national sales director mr patrick demayo senior vice president of consultant relations compensation as of fiscal year  fidelity management trust company inc key developments judge dismisses erisa suit against fidelity stable value decisions jun   the suit accused the firm of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the fidelity group employee benefit plan managed income portfolio commingled pool mip a judge in the us district court for the district of massachusetts this week dismissed an employee retirement income security act erisa lawsuit filed against fidelity management trust company over the management and monitoring of a stable value fund offered to k plans the suit ellis vs fidelity management trust co accused fidelity of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the fidelity group employee benefit plan managed income portfolio commingled pool mip a stable value fund offered as an investment option in some k plans for which fidelity was trustee the weak performance and high fees of the mip were the result of the intentional actions and omissions of fidelity as trustee of the plans the suit alleged fidelity delegated daytoday management of the mip to its affiliate fidelity management and research company and the lawsuit accused fidelity of failing to continuously monitor and supervise its affiliate among other issues plaintiffs claimed this lack of prudence and monitoring resulted in the stable value fund purchasing excessive wrap insurance that unnecessarily dampened return prospects and resulted in conflicts of interest the text of the courts decision goes into significant detail about the investment and monitoring process fidelity used in managing the stable value fund in question the plaintiffs had argued that fidelity acted in its own selfinterest by agreeing to overly stringent wrap insurance guidelines that sacrificed the competitiveness of the portfolio while allowing fidelity to grow its assets under management fidelity management trust company faces erisa lawsuit over stable value fund dec   a recently filed lawsuit accuses fidelity management trust company of engaging in imprudent investment strategies for the fidelity group employee benefit plan managed income portfolio commingled pool mip a stable value fund offered as an investment option in some k plans trusteed by fidelity according to the lawsuit during a specified class period the mip had such low investment returns and high fees that it was an imprudent retirement plan investment the poor performance and high fees of the mip were the result of the intentional actions and omissions of fidelity as trustee of the plans the suit alleges fidelity delegated daytoday management of the mip to its affiliate fidelity management and research company and the lawsuit accuses fidelity of failing to continuously monitor and supervise its affiliate the compliant says that prior to  fidelity engaged in an imprudent investment strategy for the mip that caused substantial losses to the fund and accordingly exposed itself and the mips wrap providers to substantial losses faced with a substantial decline in the mips market value and with resulting pressure from the wrap providerswhich were exposed to liability in the event of significant mip fund withdrawalsfidelity responded by adopting an unduly conservative investment strategy that was contrary to the purposes of stable value fund investing agreeing to allow the wrap providers to charge excessive fees and charging excessive fees for its own account according to the compliant in addition to its fiduciary breach under the employee retirement income security act erisa fidelity also attempted to conceal its improperly conservative investment and excessive fees from investors by solely reporting to investors an inappropriate money market benchmark for the mip rather than a proper stable value fund benchmark that made the mip returns appear to be competitive the lawsuit contends that competing stable value funds which were subject to the exact same underlying economic conditions as the mip and had the same conservative investment goals earned substantially higher returns than the mip during the relevant time period while at the same time preserving principal ensuring liquidity and providing stable returns similar private companies
