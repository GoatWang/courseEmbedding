of trustees elects new chair nov  new  million endowed scholarship honors johnson nov   resources »emory university board of trusteestags »faculty staff students university peoplejohnson honored with endowed scholarship   a new endowed scholarship has been established in emory college of arts and sciences to honor former emory board of trustees chair ben f johnson iii   the ben johnson scholarship endowment was created in recognition of johnson’s  years of service as well as the board’s commitment to scholarship endowment   read more new  million endowed scholarship honors johnsonben f johnson iii c glances out an ornately arched window quietly studying the tangled woodland ravine that rambles behind the michael c carlos hall near the southern end of emorys main campus   rooted amid a cluster of formal academic architecture the urban woodland is unexpected — a deeply shaded pocket of native beech white oak hickory and tulip poplar preserved as a vestige of what the campus used to be   standing on a winding staircase within carlos hall the original home to emorys law school johnson is immersed in history — the story of emory university yes but his own family history as well histories so deeply entwined in fact that its hard to know where each begins and ends   caseinpoint it was johnsons father former emory law school dean ben f johnson jr who decided in  that plans for a new law school must not encroach upon that neighboring ravine — today a natural area on campus relatively untouched by the march of time   a nostalgic sense of his own beginnings has brought johnson back to this building — the very place he used to frequent so often as a young boy when he would routinely accompany his father here on saturdays as the elder johnson caught up on the work of reading preparing class presentations and grading exams his son would linger nearby reading and working puzzles watching and learning and preparing always preparing — a work ethic that has followed ben johnson iii throughout his life   so it is that johnson has readied himself for this day choosing to stand here in emorys former law school — a building he virtually grew up in — for a formal portrait that will commemorate a major milestone both for himself and the university that he cares for so deeply   for the past  years johnson has served as chairman of emorys board of trustees shepherding a body charged with the powerful task of overseeing governance of the university helping shape its leadership team and ensuring its longrange fiduciary health   on nov  at the emory board of trustees annual meeting johnson formally relinquished that role as the board passed a resolution to elect emory alumnus and business executive john morgan as its new chair  board bylaws dictate that the board chair must step down at the age of  — a rule johnson wholeheartedly endorses   it allows the next generation to have its own shot at molding the institution facilitating its growth johnson explains noting that hell continue to serve the board as a trustee emeritus   as for his own legacy in helping shape emorys story johnson believes thats for others to decide but there is no doubt about what has compelled him to serve a university whose history has become so entangled with his own   in a word gratitude   the unruly paradox if there is any constant in the life of a university it is the unrelenting swell and heave of change — a dynamic that johnson eloquently described in a november  speech to honor outgoing board of  trustees chair brad currey  a great university is a thing of unruly paradox johnson said it is a place of tranquil reflection and a testing place and indeed a battleground of outrageous ideas it requires stability yet is a catalyst for change it teaches respect for boundaries yet encourages pushing those boundaries it is a place of selfconscious egalitarianism yet a place of studied rank it trains for the sacred as well as the secular it gleans from the past to prepare for the future… a great university he noted needs leadership that understands the unruliness of the paradox leadership that celebrates the unruliness of the paradox — and is committed to protecting the paradox even when it is most unruly those words reveal much about johnson who not only understood the complex paradox that drives a university but embraced it and he took to the work with a style of leadership peers describe as calm and reflective fair and collegial intuitive and intelligent — and always with an eye to the horizon the greater good of emory at heart   for more than a decade johnson has helped guide emorys fate and future his leadership offering a steady hand at a time when a global economic downturn and societal demands created very real challenges within american higher education   to illustrate the enormity of the task mentally flip backward through the pages of emorys recent history to the year  when johnson  stepped in as board chair — the first emory alumnus in that role in more than  years    the todo list had to be daunting appoint a new university president and help groom a new leadership team expand — and diversify — the board of trustees strengthen relationships with the methodist church develop a universitywide strategic plan to guide emory toward eminence as well as a master plan to steer campus development over the next decade create a greener more sustainable campus engage faculty to take a greater role in university governance launch the most ambitious fundraising campaign in emorys history raising  billion to support teaching research scholarship patient care and social action … looking back johnson recognizes these accomplishments as highlights of his tenure but hes quick to label them a team endeavor pointing to the hard work of a critical network of trustees and administrators alumni faculty and staff — a habit of smoothly deflecting credit that is very much his style according to those whove served alongside him hes easily one of the best leaders ive ever had the pleasure of working with says chilton varner l a partner with the atlanta law firm king and spalding who was elected to the emory board of trustees in  the same year johnson joined the board   hes got solid judgment and always does his homework researching any issues that might be controversial then canvassing opinion leaders and those who will be deciding an issue long before the vote taking everyones views into account says varner one of three emory trustees whove recently transitioned to trustee emeritus status along with johnson   and hes one of the most unflappable people ive ever met everyone respects his judgment — of course he always does the right thing so that helps she adds with a chuckle   many point to johnsons strength in nurturing strong relationships as a key to his success for example in emory faculty johnson saw the potential for partnerships so he helped create faculty counselor positions to serve on each of the major board committees — an opportunity for faculty engagement in university governance that would bring with it new eyes and insight   in fact emory trustee douglas ivester ascribes johnsons forwardlooking leadership with setting in motion an altogether more modern way of approaching management of the university ben set the clear expectation that leadership should be strong and creative and it should be guided and supported by the board of trustees not managed by it says emory university president james wagner who credits johnson with seeing the board through an important expansion of both size and member diversity   his legacy is one of thoughtful principled and disciplined governance unrestrained from challenging leadership to greater aspiration wagner adds   standing for what matters ask johnson to discuss his own leadership philosophy and it boils down to a simple notion surround yourself with brilliant people then back off and let them be brilliant…   a lot of the time good leadership is knowing when to keep your mouth shut when to collaborate and when to get out of the way and let others do what they do best johnson explained recently over lunch at the general muir a restaurant his son and daughterinlaw helped launch earlier this year at the emory point development along clifton road   adorned with old family photographs the thriving young business is yet another point of connection for johnson who often uses the restaurant as an informal satellite office leading up to the transition of leadership he frequently met president wagner and new board chair john morgan here for their own casual eggsandissuesstyle breakfasts   however fellow emory trustees insist that that behind johnsons calm laconic exterior — many compare him to jimmy stewart others to atticus finch — is a whipsmart legal mind they describe a man with fierce intellectual curiosity deeply rooted community connections and an intuitive grasp of both human nature and the delicate art of politics — all tempered with a bonedry wit   once during a board discussion about the possibility of a slogan or catchphrase to celebrate emorys th anniversary johnson wryly suggested emory  years without a bumper sticker johnson himself acknowledges that his somber demeanor can be misleading perhaps he suggests his tombstone should someday read he enjoyed it more than he seemed…   i just happen to be born with a mournful visage he quips im not really a sad person   but as johnson himself has observed sometimes the most effective change agent looks least like a change agent   johnson honed his leadership skills as the managing partner of alston and bird an atlantabased law firm frequently recognized as one of the nations top employers — winning a spot on fortune magazines list of the  best companies to work for for  consecutive years   even back in  when i joined the alston  bird law firm he was a budding leader says former georgia supreme court justice leah ward sears l who has served on emorys board of trustees since    years later as a jurist on the georgia supreme court sears would encounter johnson again this time he was one of the major forces behind a civil rights lawsuit that alston  bird was handling pro bono she recalls   ill always remember him for standing up where many people wouldnt stand up — standing up for things that really matter in a way that some would shy away from sears says hes got a backbone made of steel   in his role as chair of emorys board of trustees those strengths were obvious she says you really have to work hard to lead its not easy you just have to plow deep and he did it — at the same time he was also involved with other leadership roles with many other civic groups throughout the community and the managing partner of his law firm   that passion for public service it runs in the family bloodline sears insists   you know it was his father who decided that emory law school needed to enroll its first black student notes sears who is herself african american among a wave of women and minorities drawn to law schools in the late ‘s   ben just took that mantle right up that strong sense of service of connection to the community she adds hes a dotherightthing kind of guy its just that simple   a family legacy of community service to understand the catalyst for community engagement that drives ben f johnson iii it helps to understand his father — a pivotal force in his own life and a change agent for emory   bens legacy is one of thoughtful principled and disciplined governance unrestrained from challenging leadership to greater aspiration president james wagner ben f johnson jr was born in  before emory had even established an atlanta campus and grew up in what would come to be known as the virginiahighland neighborhood   the elder johnson won a scholarship to attend emory during his freshman year by the following year the great depression had taken its toll emory university — and others like it — could not continue to fund the scholarship johnson recalls   so his father dropped out of college working in a fiveanddime store to make ends meet eventually attending classes through the evening division of the university of georgia now georgia state university   by his senior year his father had enrolled at the university of georgia intent on studying greek and latin because he wanted to go to law school johnson says   i think he was drawn to the law as an instrument of change and justice he muses i think i was drawn to the law because thats what he did   after graduation johnson jr was accepted to attend law school at harvard university but due to his own fathers poor health he elected to stay closer to home enrolling instead at the emory law school where he graduated first in his class in    after practicing law with the atlanta firm of sutherland tuttle and brennan johnson jr served in the us navy in the pacific during world war ii  returning home he decided what he really wanted to do was teach according to johnson   johnson jr joined emorys law faculty in  serving as dean of the emory law school from  to  — a time of social and cultural upheaval throughout the american south as the civil rights movement began to find its voice leading emory to a defining moment   in  johnson jr joined emory board of trustees chair henry bowden sr in arguing a landmark legal case before the georgia supreme court successfully challenging a state law that denied tax exemptions to integrated private schools even though the state had already desegregated public institutions   in  emory admitted its first fulltime african american law students marvin s arrington sr who would later become a fulton county superior court judge and clarence cooper who would go on to serve as us district court judge for the northern district of georgia the following year johnson jr began seeking foundation support for a program to help recruit african american law students   looking back johnson openly acknowledges the weight of his fathers achievement he systematically changed the world in which he lived   as for what compelled him my father taught sunday school in the baptist church for over  years johnson explains he thought it was his mission to get people to think right   that passion for engagement would remain with johnson jr throughout his life in fact not long before his fathers death in  johnson recalls stopping to visit him en route to an emory board of trustees meeting — only to find his nearly yearold father heading out the door   you cant stay for long ive got to go johnson jr cautioned   where are you going asked his son   well im going to speak and demonstrate he responded heading off to tackle yet another social injustice primed to fight the good fight   throughout his fathers final years johnson enjoyed taking him on drives together they would chart the growth around emorys main campus inevitably johnson jr would marvel at the changing landscape recalling how this was just all woods when i was a kid   so emory grew up with him johnson explains and he was there every step of the way for a long long time   indebted to emory when it came time for ben johnson iii to attend college there was little question that the prospective english major would choose a liberal arts education at emory   by then the university was practically extended family with key campus leaders and faculty often dropping by the johnson house for dinner and dialogue and with his father on faculty johnson was able to attend emory on full scholarship   academically it was like being a kid in a cafeteria with an unlimited allowance johnson recalls i felt deeply indebted   johnson pauses actually … if you want to know the greatest reason why i feel indebted to emory its because i met my wife ann here   it was the fall of  —  years ago this semester she had joined the emory womens chorale and there was a student event i was supposed to have some role in and there she was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen he recalls we started dating and have been together ever since   johnson plunged fully into the emory experience from participating on the barkley forum and interfraternity council to the honor council and an assortment of honor societies at graduation johnson received the marion luther brittain service award the universitys highest student honor in recognition of service and leadership   after graduating from harvard law school johnson returned to atlanta joining alston  bird in  as a commercial litigator he also grew interested in emory alumni activities and other wider civic concerns serving as board chair for the atlanta symphony orchestra the woodward academy and the metro atlanta ymca — as well as work with the carter center woodruff arts center and the metro atlanta chamber of commerce atlantas midtown alliance   frankly i dont know anybody with the range of civic and charitable contributions that ben has made varner observes its really kind of amazing when you think about it   in  johnson was asked to join the emory board of trustees as an alumni trustee the decision he says was easy   i came to realize that if i could be of help i wanted to he recalls   the wise heart as vice president and secretary of the university rosemary magee has worked closely with emorys board of trustees around governance issues helping set an agenda for emorys future  through johnsons intuitive leadership magee says shes come to see him as the literal embodiment of the wise heart — words embedded in the emory motto that capture a sense of wisdom of the heart and all the kinds of knowledge that we seek she explains i think that sums up his work and contribution and impulse   over the years the gift of wisdom would prove critical in leading emory through times of conflict and challenge during johnsons watch the university released a formal statement of regret for its historic ties to slavery confronted a pattern of discrimination against jewish students in emorys nowdefunct school of dentistry and acknowledged the discovery of misreported data to us news  world report and yet it was the universitys forthright response to those moments that fill johnson with his greatest pride as a basic proposition i say you cant be comfortable with yourself if you are estranged from your past he asserts theres something fundamentally wrong with that   looking back over the last  years ben johnson iii is comfortable with his past — proud to have helped secure a leader like president wagner to witness the growth of both campus improvements and the impact of emory advantage a financial aid initiative which has enriched emorys student body pleased to have been able to give back to a university that has given him so much   if the life of a university is fundamentally an unruly paradox johnson found a way not to conquer it but to appreciate it to harness it to shape it   not only did he understand that complicated dynamic johnson simply stood back and with his own wise heart allowed that very force to help emory university grow and thrive and become — in the end perhaps his greatest gift of all todays news »childfriendly app gives young cancer patients a voiceemory honored in atlanta better buildings challengemba students learn grow during west coast
