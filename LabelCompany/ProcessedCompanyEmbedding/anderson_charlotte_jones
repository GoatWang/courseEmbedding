powerful woman in football  little rock soiree magazine little rock soiree follow us how charlotte jones anderson became the most powerful woman in football how charlotte jones anderson became the most powerful woman in football by nicola kavanaghtrinidade on june   categories profiles cover story charlotte jones anderson has helped her father jerry jones make the nfls dallas cowboys into one of the biggest teams in the world share it tweet it pin it charlotte jones anderson executive vice president and chief brand officer of the dallas cowboys has been named the most powerful woman in sportsanderson wears dress by barbarajean makeup by angela alexander hair by leah with joel’s salon charlotte jones anderson is the undisputed queen of american football as the dallas cowboys executive vice president and chief brand officer anderson is responsible for every detail of the cowboys brand and has helped her father transform the club from a  million enterprise to a  billion megaempire officially the most valuable franchise in international sports from the now legendary thanksgiving halftime show — which anderson took from being a small event to being a nationally televised spectacle raising billions for the salvation army — to the merchandise stadium design fan and sponsor engagement and community relations nothing escapes the watchful eye of the cowboys’ grand dame originally from little rock anderson follows closely behind business moguls johnelle hunt and alice walton in being one of the most powerful women to ever come out of arkansas and it is no small coincidence that plucky southern determination and unfaltering grace are trademarks of all three women share it tweet it pin it anderson wears outfit by barbarajean and jewelry from roberson’s fine jewelry at just  anderson newly graduated from stanford was working in her first job in the office of us representative arkansas democrat tommy f robinson when her father jerry jones came to dc to visit anderson and enlist support from her to purchase the cowboys he was well aware that the team was losing  a day and over  million a month but his passion for the team saw past the financial problems his message to anderson was urgent and unmistakable she needed to help him stop the losses and fast after some persuasion anderson agreed and was hired by her father as an executive at the club in  she has since become the most powerful woman in football after joining the cowboys anderson immediately set to work using what has proven to be one of her greatest skills her ability to build partnerships one of the earliest examples of this was addressing the club’s largest outgoing at the time laundry costs for the relentless washing of uniforms and practice gear anderson came up with a perfect solution by offering the laundry company a promotional sign on the practice field announcing them as the official laundry partner of the cowboys in return for laundering the uniforms for free little by little this enormous overhead was eradicated six years later anderson learned during a conversation with the chairman of fritolay that the salvation army was his favorite charity as they helped more children than any other impressed by what she heard anderson determined to help this charity and her means of doing so would be to create the now famous halftime show during the dallas cowboys’ thanksgiving day national game — something that had never been done before outside of the super bowl after calling in a favor from her father to get a meeting with the president of nbc sports dick ebersol and securing friend and country star reba mcentire to perform anderson managed to talk ebersol into giving her an unheard of  million worth of free airtime for the proposed event his terms were very clear though anderson had to go to the league and get an extension on halftime like they do at the super bowl and she had to produce a show that was worthy of network television or he would waste no time in cutting away and going to commercials as anderson and her father left ebersol’s office her father stopped her and said “you just got over  million worth of exposure for the salvation army now do you know what you’re doing” of course the thanksgiving day show was a huge success and has now become a national institution but this is not through coincidence or sheer good fortune anderson has the kind of eye for opportunity and insistence on perfection that makes failure impossible when she was hired by her father anderson was given only one rule “whatever you do don’t tarnish the star” and making that star shine even brighter has become a rasison d’être for her in  anderson was appointed chairman of the salvation army’s national advisory board the first woman to ever serve in that role in  she became the first woman to be named chairman of the nfl foundation which entails being responsible for spearheading the nfl efforts in youth football participation health and safety and community outreach she is also the first woman to represent club ownership as leader of a major professional sports league foundation furthermore in  she was appointed to the first nfl conduct committee which endorses and enhances the new personal conduct policy for all nfl players and employees anderson has broken every glass ceiling that is possible to break and now in her th year with the cowboys she has reached new heights with the unveiling of their latest brainchild the star the star is the cowboys’ brand new  billion headquarters and training facility in frisco texas and represents an opportunity for fans and aspiring athletes to get even closer to their beloved team in a venture that marks the first ever partnership between an nfl team and a city and school district friscoarea students are now able to play on the center’s indoor field and is something anderson hopes will inspire and help a new generation of athletes the enormous complex also features a  seatarena the ford center ford is the official truck partner of the cowboys — with anderson there is an official partner for everything  square feet of restaurant and retail space — with all beverage outlets featuring pepsico products of course an omni hotel and a sports medical facility it is an enormous endeavor and unlike anything any other team has built share it tweet it pin it the star the newest brainchild of charlotte jones anderson is the firstofitskind partnership between an nfl team and a city and school district friscoarea students will be able to play on the center’s billion facility and is something anderson hopes will inspire and help a new generation of athletes how does one woman achieve all this we manage to find a rare  minutes in anderson’s packed schedule to pick her brain on being a selfmade wonder woman have you always been a football fan or did you have to learn to love the game football is the fabric of our family growing up with two brothers and a father who loved and played football my passion for the game began at an early age with a husband who coached our boys from an early age and a daughter who cheered our days have been with filled with youth practices during the week friday night lights saturdays cheering for the hogs and the stanford cardinal and of course the cowboys football is who we are how do you feel about the representation of women in sports and what would you say to women wanting to get there in my  years of working in the nfl i have seen the number of women involved in our game increase given that almost  of our fan base is female our voice is not only important it’s powerful with the cowboys  of our employees are women my advice to them is to be willing to go the extra mile do whatever it takes even when it’s not in your job description and be confident and openminded don’t be afraid to make a mistake or fail — this is where you learn and come back at it stronger and more determined just like the game of football i do hope that the opportunities that have been afforded to me through the cowboys and the nfl as appointed by the commissioner will inspire others to reach for their dreams in the world of sports did you feel when you were starting out that you had to work smarter and harder than the men to prove yourself i have always felt like i had to work smarter and harder than the person sitting next to me regardless of gender whether that be in high school in little rock college at stanford washington dc or with the cowboys i knew i could not control if i was the smartest person in the room or the most talented but i could control working harder than anyone else i have been fortunate to have been raised by parents who never saw gender my father always had more confidence in me than i ever had in myself when he “drafted” me  years ago he knew he was getting someone he could trust that would work as hard as he would to find ways to make the team successful i have never taken this opportunity lightly nor does anyone else in our family we have been entrusted with a team that so many are passionate about and our focus is on making those fans proud of the team we put on the field each week what is your favorite thing about your job there are so many things i love about what i do my father has always said that you need to have a high tolerance for ambiguity that is certainly the case every day my job is different challenging and inspiring every day i am surrounded by the constant pursuit of excellence on the field in the boardroom and in the sales center as we put on the touchstone of the star our new training facility “it is a privilege not a right to play coach and work for the dallas cowboys” and with that privilege comes a great responsibility i love that every day i get to use the visibility and interest that surrounds our game and the magic that it creates to make a difference off the field in the lives of others my job is purposeful and for that i will forever be grateful who are your role models i am fortunate to call my parents my greatest mentors if i got my passion from my father i got my compassion from my mother they raised me to find my purpose and passion in life they taught by example showing me the importance of family hard work and determination they continue to provide constant support instill confidence and encourage me to set my goals high and dream big even in the midst of all the chaos and excitement family is always first how does being a southern girl influence the way you work one of my favorite quotes comes from maya angelou but has truly been a philosophy that i was raised with and have lived by my entire life “people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but they will never forget how you made them feel” i am very much a people person and i have always believed in treating people with respect and dignity regardless of who they are or where they came from you can inspire your team and those around you far greater by respecting their worth valuing their input and empowering their growth respect for others and grace now that’s southern share it tweet it pin it in  anderson became the first woman to be appointed chairman of the salvation army’s national advisory board and in  became the first woman to be named chairman of the nfl foundation why did you want to build the star we set out to create a firstofitskind world headquarters and training facility where the cowboys partner with the city of frisco and the frisco independent school district in a way that’s unprecedented in the nfl and in sport the idea of being inextricably linked to high school football by creating an indoor training facility for us that would serve as their indoor stadium was the physical goal the intangible goal was to inspire the next generation of players and fans by uniquely engaging them where we live work and play while the star is the heart of the dallas cowboys we wanted it to be the soul of the community we’re excited about this incredibly unique opportunity to be a part of the frisco community at an intrinsic level we’re hoping to inspire a lot of great kids and adults to do a lot of great things the star is not just about the cowboys it is about the future of amateur athletics not only is the ford center the home of frisco high school football but for all sports engaging amateur athletes in soccer lacrosse basketball cheer and more with the partnership with baylor scott and white operators of the medical facility and their commitment to sports treatment injury prevention and the research center it will be the safest place to play to sports and help guide the future of sports medicine what is the most valuable lesson you’ve learned both of my parents were strong enforcers of “to whom much is given much is to be expected” i know the blessings in my life come with a call to action to help those who are less fortunate i strive every day to be a great example to my children which in turn honors and pays respect to what my parents gave to me i love the mission of the salvation army — “doing the most good” — which summarizes my personal and professional aspiration you have achieved so many recordbreaking things but what are you most proud of i am most proud of my children my oldest daughter graduated from u of a my middle son is a junior at u of a and my youngest son is in high school by far my greatest achievement is being their mother and a wife to my supportive husband i believe in the phrase “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” is there anything that you’re still itching to achieve personal or otherwise would love to win another super bowl what is it that drew you to the salvation army our family and the dallas cowboys began our partnership with the salvation army over twenty years ago in the early ‘s we realized that we had the opportunity to harness the excitement and visibility of our game and the magic that it creates to make an impact on the community around us we recognized that we could partner with an organization that was truly making a difference in the lives of those who needed the most help and magnify their impact but we also recognized that whoever we chose needed to have international reach a strong brand awareness and be fundamentally based on integrity and service that’s the salvation army they are true stewards of other people’s generosity doing the most good day in and day out we created and launched the first ever nationally televised red kettle kickoff during the halftime of the dallas cowboys thanksgiving day game over the past  years through the exposure on national television the leveraging of our players the game and brand coupled with powerful entertainers we have inspired people to donate to the red kettles to raise over  billion the salvation army lives their promise to do “the most good” and they do so without discrimination they are trustworthy and passionate about their cause i know when i am making a donation to the salvation army that i can trust that every penny of my dollar will be used to help those who need it most it’s

recently the daughter of cowboys owner jerry jones sat down with forbes and discussed the team from her point of view by dawnmacellidmacbtb jan   pm cst tweet share pin rec kirby leeusa today sports charlotte jonesanderson has spent the entire tenure of her career with the cowboys as the person in charge of growing the brand in fact her official title is chief brand officer according to mrs jonesanderson her father realized the significance of the dallas cowboys brand and the importance of the blue star logo from the very start of the jones family involvement in the team when i began work with the cowboys  years ago my only instruction was youre in charge of the brand and whatever you do just dont tarnish the star  charlotte jonesanderson while to the average fan charlottes brother stephen may appear to be the most influential of the jones children thanks to his high profile involvement in running the football side of the organization from a business point of view it is the sister who actually wields the power from a financial perspective it is the brand that is most often a corporations valuable asset on the balance sheet in short it can be argued the brand and not the onfield product puts the money in the owners pockets in a statement that echoed her father who during the season stated that he was not concerned with fan apathy due to the good show that the cowboys are providing charlotte is more concerned with providing the fans with an entertainment experience she notes that on the field success would make the challenge simpler when the team is not winning it is harder to keep building the success of the dallas cowboys as a business organization when the team is not winning mrs jonesanderson is fortunate that she has a history to fall back on since as charlotte admits she cannot control the product that the dallas cowboys put out into the marketplace the chief brand officer is focused on selling what she calls a dallas cowboys lifestyle when the team is winning it is easy to move the romo and bryantrelated products but since sustained success is not a recent trend in dallas she must sell the past glory that is a part of americas team charlotte jonesanderson is focused on marketing the whole package and focused on selling the mystique that is the dallas cowboys in fact that mystique and how to benefit from it is her primary challenge you inherit such an incredible legacy of great tradition and great success how do you take that and grow it expand it how do you grow that to be entertainment we have always known that we are really entertainment were a respite from peoples live in addition to selling the cowboys legacy and what it means to those of us who have been addicted to the blue star for the majority of our lives jonesanderson is also well aware that she is selling both an advertising opportunity and a fan experience inside att stadium one of her primary duties within the organization is for her to continue to progress in both areas the key for the cowboys as a business is the way they respond to a pair of business questions how do you develop your partnerships with your corporate sponsors and how does your fan engagement change over time the jones family covers two areas for cowboys success  the dollars and cents on a financial balance sheet and the numbers on a box score sure they enjoy the momentary thrill that comes from a successful sunday but they are also business people and they must also win by increasing revenue they are not necessarily marketing football they are marketing a lifestyle where as charlotte stated we want people to feel like they own a part of the cowboys and that they are equally invested as we are as owners as an organization to achieve that feeling the jones family relies not only on the successfailure of the team but on the perceived image that is the brand it is a great spot to be in to go into every city that we travel to and were the first most hated but the second most loved so you find that niche and we have fans all overpeople will tell you what they think and to your face and we love that as much as other fans around the league may hate to admit it the proof lies in the truth of what jonesanderson says no matter where the dallas cowboys go around the league home or away they are the big show while teams may rise and fall in the standings one thing remains constant the dallas cowboys remain the biggest show in the game and that is thanks in part to the efforts of jerry jones daughter at the end of the day as a business model

pinterest print twitter the woman behind the ’boys how charlotte jones anderson the chief brand officer and executive vice president for the dallas cowboys helped build the organization into a  billion behemoth by dan solomonjanuary  comments charlotte jones anderson photographed in january  press spacebar to see more share options it’s the day before thanksgiving and charlotte jones anderson is very busy as people across the nation prep for turkey day—baking pies cleaning their homes traveling across congested highways—anderson the dallas cowboys’s executive vice president is trying to tape a quick video to congratulate “papa” john schnatter on a banner year for his company she had filmed one heartfelt appreciation the day before but the staffer who taped it held the phone vertically rather than horizontally so they’re at it again aesthetics are very important to anderson she is the cowboys’ chief brand officer after all she pauses for a moment in her blue blouse leather pants and heels as she tries to recall the entire minutelong monologue she had improvised a day earlier then signals to her assistant to start who records as anderson smiles warmly talking into the camera to schnatter about how proud she and the entire cowboys organization are to be associated with papa john’s the chain is the official pizza partner of the dallas cowboys about  seconds in her assistant stops her—anderson’s blouse has an odd wrinkle that looks strange on camera—and they reset anderson smiles again launches nearly verbatim right back into the message and brings the performance to a succinct elegant conclusion she nails it filming the congratulatory message was just one more thing for anderson to juggle in a monthslong preparation process for the dallas cowboys thanksgiving halftime show a highly choreographed performance that would include a set by country singer eric church and his band the full array of dallas cowboy cheerleaders and an army of local volunteers—most of whom are decked out in cowboys gear that they’ve owned for years—that make up the “mosh pit” of fans panned over by the camera during the musical performance anderson has been producing the thanksgiving halftime show since  starting when she was just  years old and working every connection she had to bring her vision to life and now the nationally televised performance has become as much a part of the thanksgiving tradition as the cowboys game itself but it’s taken a lot of work—much of it by anderson—to get to this point back in  the cowboys were certainly an institution—the moniker “america’s team” dates back to the late seventies—but the organization didn’t make any lists of the world’s most valuable brands when anderson’s father jerry jones bought the team in  he paid  million in  years his daughter has helped him shape that investment into a massive  billion titan officially the most valuable franchise in international sports her connections in  might have been meager but these days everybody who’s in business with the cowboys or the nfl—and that is a lot of people—knows anderson the whole thanksgivingeve afternoon is basically a whirlwind of activity for her she greets collaborators when eric church’s road manager shows up wearing a tennessee titans ball cap she jokes with him feigning offense over his sartorial decision she manages her other daytoday duties when her father has a phone meeting she sneaks away from the field to sit in on the call she works to keep everyone cared for and happy when the team’s kitchen staff pass out turkey dinners to people working on the production she tracks me down to ask me if i’ve had enough to eat it becomes very clear very fast that no detail is too small for her at one point during the day anderson was in a fieldlevel suite sitting at a macbook going over the final edit of a video explaining the cowboys’s history with salvation army that would play before the game on the att stadium jumbotron—and would air on televisions around the country dak prescott appears on the screen to explain why he believes giving to the red kettle drive is important and then a graphic appears to herald the  billion that the cowboys have helped raise for the salvation army over the organization’s twenty years of producing the halftime show anderson watches the graphic then stops a production staffer—shouldn’t there be a dollar sign next to the words “ billion” “two billion what” she asks the staffer the staffer says they can put a small dollar sign next to the two and anderson overrules him she wants it big this is the cowboys after all twenty minutes later the dollar sign is huge and anderson satisfied is on to the next task it’s apparent that this isn’t exactly an ordinary day in the life of the most powerful woman in the dallas cowboys organization—maybe in the entire nfl—but then when you have the sort of job anderson holds extraordinary becomes par for the coursedarren woodson ricardo guadalupe and charlotte jones anderson unveil the hublot big bang dallas cowboys timepieces at att stadium in november  photo by cooper neillgetty images for hublotwhen jerry jones bought the dallas cowboys in  he didn’t have a clue how to run a football team anderson was a yearold recent graduate from stanford university working her first job in the office of us representative tommy f robinson rarkansas when she got a call from her father that he needed her help the franchise he had just purchased was bleeding money she had no intention of joining the family business when she entered college—the jones’ were involved with petroleum engineering and she didn’t want to be a landman or visit oil fields—but then jerry bought the ’boys and suddenly the family business changed stephen anderson’s brother was a former college football player who was allin from the moment the opportunity presented itself but anderson needed to be convinced “i told my dad i don’t know how to run a football team he said ‘that’s okay neither do i we’re going to figure it out together and we’ll make mistakes learn from them and move on let’s just find a way to stop losing money’” she recalls her father saying “‘and whatever you do don’t tarnish the star’” this is an anecdote that anderson has probably relayed a million times in her life and it shows i interviewed her three times over the course of this story and like an artful storyteller repeating a wellworn creation myth she would at some point in each conversation say the words “stop losing money and whatever you do don’t tarnish the star” nearly verbatim the phrase clearly stuck with her and she quickly figured out how to use the power of the star one of the top expenses for the cowboys when anderson came to the team was what she called “socks and jocks” the money the team spent on washing uniforms during training camp anderson found a local laundromat in austin where the cowboys held camp and offered them a deal you wash the uniforms you get a sign on the practice field announcing that you’re the official laundry partner of the dallas cowboys problem solved money saved in anderson’s origin story this is the bat crashing through the window of stately wayne manor her ability to forge numerous strategic partnerships has been a big reason why the cowboys went from a  million investment to a franchise worth  billion and she’s taken to cultivating those official partners like a gardener who plants one of everything the soil will take official pizza partner papa john’s official soft drink partner pepsi official truck partner ford official luxury car partner lincoln official luxury watch partner swiss manufacturer hublot a hublot dallas cowboys king power watch will set you back a cool  delivered in a box shaped like att stadium alongside a minihelmet signed by a cowboys player anderson learned there was great potential in monetizing a cowboys fan’s connection to the team but she takes the twowaystreet portion of the partnership seriously “how do i help my partner deliver on their engagement with us to the best of my ability” anderson says “we take that and we live it and we require others around us to do so too” consider the new team headquarters a mixeduse development project that anderson designed in frisco named “the star” obviously there’s space for several restaurants there and all of them will be serving pepsi products none of this is what anderson studied to do but the jones family philosophy of figuring it out on the job has ultimately ended up shaping her whole life that’s never more apparent than in a fanfavorite anderson creation tale that goes right back to that thanksgiving game halftime show during rehearsals the day before thanksgiving everybody i talked to became really animated when recalling the story of how that event came together a thenyearold anderson had learned from the chairman of pepsico that the salvation army was his favorite nonprofit “do you know which charity helps more children than any other” she recalls him telling her she was so moved by this she decided to use her platform to help raise awareness and funds for the organization “i knew the one national game that we could count on every year was thanksgiving and i knew about the red kettles and i thought that maybe we could start something that we could do year after year and at least the  people in the stadium would know about what they do” anderson recalls she went to her dad and told him she needed a favor “i need you to get me a meeting with the president of nbc” jones laughed but set up the meeting with thennbc president dick ebersol before the meeting anderson called in some different star power she had become friends with reba mcentire through the cowboys’ super bowl years so she went to nashville to see if the country singer would be interested in helping with a halftime show centered around the organization “mcentire said ‘the salvation army used to serve my grandfather donuts on the frontline of the war—i’ll do whatever you want me to do’” so anderson and mcentire went into the studio “we literally went into the studio and she cut a song” anderson recalls “troy aikman was involved michael irvin was involved emmitt smith was involved—all our guys were in on that deal and we actually wrote this song” equipped with the song and a boombox to play it on anderson went to  rock with the pitch “we walk into dick ebersol’s office he looks at dad and he goes ‘so why are you here’ and dad looks at him and says ‘charlotte here had something she’d like to ask you’” she recalls “i started to talk about the salvation army and how there are only two games on thanksgiving so there’s not a lot that you need to cover—so how about you air this and he just looked at me and said ‘no one has ever come into my office and asked me for free airtime before’ and he just sat there ‘well how ’bout it this is great it’s thanksgiving you need to have a warm heart’ he looks at me and he goes ‘i’ll tell you what i’ll do i’ll air your show under two conditions one you’ve got to go to the league and get an extension on halftime like they do at the super bowl and two you’ve gotta produce a show that’s worthy of network television or i’ll cut away and go to commercial’” anderson shook his hand said “yes sir” and walked out of the office with her father “he grabbed my hand and he said ‘do you know what you just did’ i said ‘i got my first nationallytelevised halftime show’ he said ‘no you just got over  million worth of exposure for the salvation army now do you know what you’re doing’” anderson’s autodidactic abilities have most recently taken the form of a literal monument to the organization she helped build the star a  billion complex in frisco that serves as the team’s headquarters and practice facility as well as the stadium for frisco isd the project was a family affair—jerry and stephen oversaw most of the real estate development while anderson and her younger brother jerry jr approved the tenants anderson also designed the space “i was probably the project manager in terms of there’s not anything out here that i didn’t have my signature on the back of” she says “i approved the color of the grass the color of the stone the mortar all of that in the omni hotel i can tell you where the comforter is where the star is on the comforter what the lobby looks like how many square feet in the ballrooms   ” again no detail too small anderson was the one that made sure that in the restaurant themed around cowboys legends it was exactly fifty yards from the roger staubach section to the drew pearson section—the length of the  hail mary pass she was the one who pressed jason garrett to give her a twoword summation of the most important thing for each player to think about every day so she could put it on the walls of the film room “the team the team the team” she was the one who decided that the wall near the locker room should be decorated with a shot of jason witten running toward the end zone without his helmet on in a  game against the eagles to symbolize the heart cowboys players should have but before there was the star there was att stadium it may be known as jerryworld and while ticket prices and determining the number of suites were her dad and her brother’s responsibilities anderson brought her own sensibilities to the design of the project “when we built the stadium we each started with a blank piece of paper of what we were going to put in it the things that i valued and that my mother valued versus the things that the guys valued we had a long list and they had a long list and probably only  percent of them crossed over” she says her dad and her brothers were she says more “tactical” “i need this many people in the building i need this many people here” she laughs “i want to see i would like to go see the players where are they can they come through i’m not going to go into the locker room so can they come see me” now fans can see players as they pass through the stadium on their way out to the field an experience unique to att stadium and if you’re not a football fan anderson and her family built in a reason to visit the stadium they acquired a worldclass contemporary art collection in october  they added a  million sculpture by national medal for the arts recipient ellsworth kelly “if you’re visiting from europe and you come to see the art you might get curious about our game too” anderson says like with the star complex and the halftime show building a worldclass sports stadium was another project she had no experience in until she and her family took it on “it’s crazy” she says “i don’t think i had any training in anything that i’ve done i’ve always had an insecurity because i didn’t have the training in x or the training in y to do this are we just winging this but when it’s yours to lose you take on that responsibility far differently than if you’re working for someone else you don’t have the same vested interest the learning process of it has taught me not to be afraid of what you don’t know and to trust your gut instinct at the end of the day” all of this is the product of hard work and more than that of someone who rises to challenges anderson is a serious presence she’s one of the most important women in the most important sport in american life but the nfl is also at a crossroads between concussions domestic violence a divided cultural climate and parents who are scared to let their kids play the game things are changing—and anderson is in a unique position to shape that changenew york jets owner robert wood “woody” johnson charlotte jones anderson the dallas cowboys’s executive vice president of brand management and new england patriots owner bob kraft in new york city at a  press conference introducing an initiative and research program to study concussions photo by allison joycegetty imagesnegative news about the nfl has become more and more regular in recent years there have been domestic violence allegations and incidents involving highprofile players including current cowboys superstars ezekiel elliott who is under investigation by the nfl for an alleged incident though no charges have been brought and dez bryant who was arrested in  for an alleged incident involving a family member there are also the concussions which have led to a billion dollar settlement for former players and a number of suicides including among former stars like dave duerson and junior seau for some parents the question of culture has made them hesitant to let their kids play anderson has three children two of them boys shy the oldest is a junior at the university of arkansas and played football in high school “he didn’t quite have the dez bryant level of talent to continue” anderson admits in  anderson moved her youngest paxton to highland park high school for their football program where he plays wide receiver on “an unbelievable little team” according to his mom “i know about the physicality of it and i know about the benefits of building young men into future leaders of tomorrow that’s why i let my kids play” anderson says “there’s an inherent risk in everything we do but in our sport with the physical nature of it there’s an inherent risk of injury—but weighing all of that i choose to want my kids to play they want to play and i certainly endorse and support and encourage these are individual personal decisions for parents to make for their own kids” and for some kids and their families proximity to the cowboys could play a part in those decisions the star isn’t just the team’s practice facility or a tourist destination for fans who want to sleep in a hotel with cowboysbranded sheets—it’s also the stadium for frisco isd’s high school athletics a firstofitskind partnership that anderson is very proud of through one set of doors the cowboys enter the stadium and through the opposite set of doors the young players in frisco isd walk into that same stadium it’s easy to imagine being a teenager at frisco isd with big football dreams and then realizing that your field is also dak prescott’s field and if you need a little extra inspiration the high school side of the facility is decorated with images of cowboys stars as they looked in high school so you can compare your own height weight and stats to tony romo’s at the same age but being a de facto representative of parents who are weighing the decision of whether to allow their kids to play football isn’t anderson’s only role when it comes to dealing with football culture she started her career in politics she’s keen on talking about the power of football as both a business force and a platform to affect change whether with the salvation army or in developing coaches who can help coach boys into better men but when i asked her about the sb “bathroom bill” introduced in early january by dan patrick—patterned after a similar bill in north carolina that led bruce springsteen pearl jam and the nba allstar game to all cancel events planned for stadiums in that state—she demurred she said things like “i think the role of sports is to not be political” and “we need to be a venue that accommodates” and “our experience is a safe environment that everyone can enjoy” yet politics and business often overlap for jones whose responsibility to fill a stadium on the better part of the year the cowboys aren’t using it something like sb could theoretically threaten her bottom line when pressed she told me that if a hypothetical bruce springsteen concert was canceled “if we can create a setting in which you can walk in and have a great experience and someone else can say the same thing then we’ve already solved the problem the conversation to bruce springsteen is that our constituents that attend don’t have a problem so maybe the problem is yours” on thanksgiving day anderson is in the family’s suite at att stadium it’s behind a security checkpoint on a premium level of the stadium called the owner’s club where the aesthetic is kind of luxury spaceship in the bathrooms behind the glass of the mirrors there are televisions so you can watch yourself watch dez bryant make a big play while you wash your hands the holiday feast is gourmet with silent servers bringing refills and clearing plates of the fans who paid for access to that level of the stadium inside the suite itself anderson and her brothers munch on popcorn with members of the salvation army’s board new jersey governor chris christie and his family and former cowboys star michael irvin before the cowboys’ game against washington kicks off anderson’s eyes are focused on one of the televisions in the room watching the detroit game after the success of the halftime show she launched in  the nfl decided to introduce a similar program for the thanksgiving afternoon game which the lions play each year unlike the cowboys’ show the league office produces that event and anderson likes to scope out the competition she’s got eric church and the dallas cowboys cheerleaders what do they have “it’s always interesting to see what’s going on” she says “i can’t help but want to watch in this league everything’s a competition” the performance by pop singer andy grammer is less than inspired after the show sports illustrated would declare it “forgettable” and call grammer a “hair model” charlotte jones anderson one nfl zero it’s a busy day for her but less busy than the one that preceded it all of the preproduction and rehearsal work is done so her top priority at this point is making sure that everyone does their job and that she gets to enjoy at least part of the day with her family anderson doesn’t seem like she takes many days off but this one feels earned while we chat her dad walks by and when he realizes that his daughter is doing an interview with texas monthly he takes a few minutes to explain what she brings to the organization “i think i’m actually misunderstood about being mywayorthehighway it’s not that way” he says “it really is if i know someone’s done their homework then they do influence me and can turn me on about it if they’ve done their homework” “there’s a high expectation of a lot of homework” anderson says laughing around her dad she’s a little more deferential a little less executive vice president that’s one of the interesting things about the dynamic at the cowboys organization they’re a family which means that almost the entire leadership team has known each other since they were in diapers the cowboys have allowed anderson to grow into a person with an incredible set of professional skills but also she’s someone who’s working the same job she had right out of college that she got because her dad offered it to her so is working for the dallas cowboys the last job she’ll ever have anderson seems contemplative when i put it to her like she can’t really imagine doing anything else but also reflective about the fact that her life has taken her to some unexpected places “that is such a good question considering i didn’t know that this was going to be my first job it’s hard to…” she trails off for a moment “as i sit here and… what the game itself has been able to bring and fulfill—not just for me personally or my family but what we’ve been able to do with it and influence off the field has been far greater than i have ever imagined it’s more than a game when i first came to work for the cowboys i thought i was a producer at heart i produced fashion shows and things like that on a little scale then all of a sudden i had thanksgiving halftime and i was producing nationally televised shows i get a real thrill with live entertainment it’s changed the way i thought about my job in the beginning to what i see the possibilities for now” so she’ll probably be with the cowboys so long as she gets to keep doing new things she has ideas about what they might be—she loves the idea of convincing a major awards show to do their event at att stadium “to go big and go live in front of  people instead of ” when i ask her what’s next she’s immediately onbrand “go win a super bowl” but ultimately the answer is even more specific than that can she keep building the cowboys and the facilities that the cowboys are associated with into something that’s always getting bigger and better “with the stadium you’ve got to fill it and not just ten games a year—it costs a lot to turn the lights on at the stadium once you figure that formula out then we end up at the star and have to figure out how we’re going to make that work” she says “we’ve got to bring people out to the star we’ve got to fill the restaurants we’ve got to make them successful so everything else will be successful that’s the charge that’s what’s next” tags business longreads the dallas cowboys sports football charlotte jones
