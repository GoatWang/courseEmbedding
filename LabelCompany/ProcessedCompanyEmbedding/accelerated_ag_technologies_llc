centers on understanding the physiological mechanisms controlling the response of seed formation and development to environmental stresses  westgates research and collaborations have coupled the quantitative aspects of floral biology with the physical drivers of pollen dispersal in several crops and have used this approach to predict seed formation and outcrossing in maize seed and grain production product services — accelerated ag technologies accelerated ag technologies accelerated ag technologies productservicesaat’s technology will not be regulated and once scaled and optimized can be used immediately by major seed companies for each application aat’s major product is intellectual property for methods that will enable the seed industry to reduce the expenses associated with seed production for current hybrid crops while enabling cost effective hybrid seed production for the first time in varietal or selfpollinated crops in addition to intellectual property we will provide services and tools which enable the processes and methodstarget marketthe target market is the global seed industry within the global seed industry we are focusing on the us seed industry first within the seed industry aat’s technology breaks down into several major categories the first minimal viable product serves both seed researchers and parent seed producers this forms the foundation for larger markets that include hybrid seed and grain productionbusiness modelinitial value capture will be via corn applications which will form the ground work for continuing selffunded rd in wheat and rice the route to market is to license royalty bearing intellectual property to agricultural seed companies while keeping options open for outright sale of patents andor portions of the company applications beyond agriculture eg horticulture will be maintained for future research and intellectual property interests customerswithin the us seed industry the most basic customer segment in which the minimal viable product will be offered in  is corn seed producers in research and parent seed production the technology will be scaled up from these segments to be offered to corn hybrid seed producers in  and corn grain producers in   salesmarketing strategyaat’s initial strategy is to collaborate with select second tier seed companies where our processes can improve efficiencies in research programs and corn parent seed production with basic enablement from aat the ip will be simple to implement these collaborations form the ground work for the next phase which focuses on corn hybrid seed producers the initial phase is implemented and we anticipate initiating the second phase in   competitorsfor more than  years major global seed companies have focused and spent billions on the development of biotech traits at the expense of improving seed production methods the only effort to this end has focused on developing male sterility to enable and improve hybridity in plants this approach is limited for crops like corn as only  percent of hybrid seed is produced using genetic male sterility in addition this approach has failed for important crops like wheat in which  years and counting of efforts have not enabled cost effective production of hybrid seedcompetitive advantageaat’s intellectual property takes a new look at hybrid seed production and bypasses the resource intensive steps employed by current seed production methods as a result of our competitors placing the majority of their focus on genetic male sterility technologies aat is afforded the competitive edge to gain first mover advantages in a technology area with little existing intellectual property accelerated ag technologies  urbandale ia us startup start up confidently
