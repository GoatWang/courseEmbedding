their contracts allowing for appropriate longterm strategic planning b the new portfolio better promotes their goals of increasing administrative efficiency of and control over their contracts because the new portfolio is part of their affiliated fund family c streamlining the number of nonproprietary funds available through the contracts and altering the available portfolios will simplify the administration of the contracts particularly with regard to communications with the fund families and the preparation of various reports and disclosure documents and d this streamlining will allow the

legal analysis  section c of the act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution the commission may approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and assert that replacement of the old portfolios with the new portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants have reserved the right to make such a substitution under the contracts and represent that this reserved right is disclosed in the prospectus for the contracts  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principal from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company pursuant to section a of the act the section b applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the substitutions because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of inkind transactions the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  the section b applicants state that the terms under which the inkind redemptions and purchases will be effected are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person principally because the substitutions will conform with all but two of the conditions enumerated in rule a applicants assert that the use of inkind transactions will not cause contract owner interests to be diluted in support applicants represent that a the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts b contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions and c fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions  further though the section b applicants may not rely on rule a because they cannot meet all of its conditions the section b applicants agree to carry out the proposed inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the procedures adopted thereunder except that  the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash and  the sun capital trust board will not separately review each portfolio security purchased by the new portfolio however applicants assert that the circumstances surrounding the substitutions will offer the same degree of protection to the new portfolio from overreaching that rule a provides to it generally in connection with its purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of its business  applicants assert that the board of sun capital trust has adopted procedures as required by rule a and that sun capital or any subadviser to the new portfolio will review the securities holdings of the old portfolio to determine whether their portfolio holdings would be suitable investments for the new portfolio in the overall context of its investment objectives and policies and consistent with its management applicants also note that the companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed substitutions at a price disadvantageous to the new portfolio although the substitutions may not be entirely for cash applicants represent that each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each portfolio involved valued according to the procedures disclosed in its registration statement and as required by rule c under the act the section b applicants state that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the new portfolio to effect the inkind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios and redeeming and purchasing values will be the same applicants note that if sun capital start printed page declines to accept particular portfolio securities of either of the old portfolios for purchase inkind of shares of the new portfolio the applicable old portfolio will liquidate portfolio securities as necessary and purchase new portfolio shares with cash consistent with rule ad applicants also agree that no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the inkind transactions conclusions  applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth in their application the requested order meets the standards set forth in section c and should therefore be granted  section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions meet all of the requirements of section b of the act and that an exemption should be granted to the extent necessary from the provisions of section a start signature for
