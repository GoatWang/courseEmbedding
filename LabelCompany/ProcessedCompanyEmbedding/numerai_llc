interesting for folks that are more into ml  responses grant kiehne httpsemail protectedencrypteddataforefficientmarketsfffbebaxmxvyil a nice accessible article by the founder if they havent already the q team may want to have a look at this one we’re buying regularizing and encrypting all of the financial data in the world and giving it away for free by requiring that you upload predictions instead of the code related to your model we ensure that you can retain all intellectual property rights to your model we want you to be able to remain completely anonymous on numerai to facilitate anonymity we offer payments in bitcoin as well as usd for q im wondering if this sort of approach might be better basically only farm out the problems that they need help with versus trying to get the crowd to write entire standalone institutionalgrade trading strategies that mere mortals wouldnt trade with their own money anyway since millions to tens of millions of dollars are required plus the arbitrary software and hardware constraints of q are removed the numerai crowd is free to pick their own analysis tools and deploy them on their own desktopcloud highperformance computing platforms sounds like they already have their hedge fund up and running we use predictions from our platform to trade global securities in our hedge fund numerai fund  lp operated by the management company numerai llc our independent fund administrator is ssc technologies inc and our prime broker is interactive brokers llc frank vigilante any one want to collaborate on numerai i threw a couple ml algos at the data this week and managed to crack  on the leaderboard for the upcoming month would love to swap prediction figures or compare approaches to the data alpha seeker grant that mere mortals wouldnt trade with their own money anyway since millions to tens of millions of dollars are required i would have thought that a good number of users here build algos and also trade the algos with their own capital real money via connecting their q algos with brokers eg interactive brokers in fact i imagine this could also be a revenue stream for q here  to take a cut of commission generated with such trading activities numerai would not have such commission sharing revenue model they pay out cash to purchase quality info from the crowd please sign in or join quantopian to post a reply
