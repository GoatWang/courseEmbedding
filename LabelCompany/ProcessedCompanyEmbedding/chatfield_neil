fellow of the australian institute of company directors faicd  in  neil was awarded australian chief financial officer of the yearit gives me great pleasure to invite mr neil chatfield to deliver the occasional addressspeechchancellor vice chancellor faculty deans and staff distinguished guests graduates family and friendsi would also like to acknowledge the traditional owners of this land the gadigal and guringgai people of the eora nation upon whose ancestral lands the university now standslet me firstly say to you graduates how delighted i am to be here with you today and to be part of your well deserved graduation celebrationsyou have all reached an important milestone in your career journey a milestone of which you should be immensely proud and one which is just reward for your efforts and personal commitmentsome  years ago i was fortunate enough to complete my masters in business from this university however unlike today there were no iphones no ipads no google no apps or no cloud infact the internet and emails had only barely just arrived on the scene in those days social media consisted largely of fixed line telephone calls and notices in the newspaper in addition the world then was far less globalised and the impact of an emerging asia was not yet on the radarin my mind you will never find a better time to graduate and embark on a career using the knowledge skills and experiences acquired during your time with utstoday’s business world is more exciting than ever before and so are the opportunities available to you we are in a truly global world now with technology allowing rapid interaction between consumers and businesses around the worldlet me put the settings in perspectivefirstly australia is uniquely positioned in asia a region which is destined to grow strongly over the long term and continue to demand australia’s key resources be they mining agriculture education health or financial servicesin particular the emergence of china as australia’s major trading partner is very important the growth of export of our mineral resources continues whilst the future of our agricultural sector is assured due to china’s growing demand for food related productsforeign investment from china and for that matter from throughout asia will also drive domestic economic growth and stimulate business activity over the long termactivities in education and health services are also benefiting greatly from chinese demand and are likely to be important areas for growth going forward as china slowly transitions to a more services based economythe prospect of australia exporting human capital and establishing businesses throughout asia is also compelling the ability of australian companies to grow by broadening their geographic reach into asia is now a reality although many more opportunities exist it is encouraging to see iconic australian companies such as anz and seek building a successful presence in asia and taking australian knowhow to the world’s biggest economiesthe fact that technology driven australian companies can successfully develop business models in asia and the broader emerging markets where populations are many multiples of australia’s and internet penetration is still growing is a very significant indicator of future opportunities available secondly the online world will continue to enable you to increase your productivity and participation in new and developing business modelsthe online environment is having a profound impact on business activities traditional businesses which cannot or will not change are being quickly replaced by organisations which imbed technology and innovation into their businessthe impact of technology and pace of change cannot be overstated and is occurring at a much faster rate than anyone predicted disrupting business models can become “traditional” themselves in a relatively short time and themselves be faced with competition from new emerging disruptive modelsthe influence of enabling technologies for instance such as mobile devices is also significant as is the impact of new affordable and more efficient technologiesimagine the impact on an organisation which  years ago had less than  of its customer contact and website access from mobile devices but today has over  and consider a bank which used to have customers check their paper based statements once a month or a quarter who now have customers checking balances more than  times a day managing their banking superannuation and home loans in a central location and largely from mobile devicesthese are just small but significant examples of how the business world is now more connected and open than everorganisations have great opportunities as well as threats from the digital environmentas a consequence of the use of online search and advertising as well as communications from social media in addition of course to product delivery onlinebusinesses now have large amounts of data in relation to their customers suppliers and competitors data which needs to inform business design and changes to products services and processes and most importantly turned into value creating strategies and responsesall these impacts of technology also raise the risk profile of organisations by increasing volatility and substantially shortening the lead time for action skills in identifying and managing risk and the financial consequences of control failures now need to be even more front and centre in the way businesses are managed   i see tremendous alignment between the business consequences of the online world and your skills as your ability to understand the value chain and measure benefits of enabling technology and the associated risks and bringing a financial lens to these issues are essential inputs as business models evolvethirdly your skills will continue to be in high demand and grow in importance as enterprises and governments strive to become more productive and improve returns on investmentas most organisations try to do more with less the need to design measure and monitor the financial and business impact of operations and new models and initiatives becomes critically important it is no surprise that business and finance graduates form a major part of the community of business leaders many have become senior chief financial officers and chief executives in this environment of rapid change brought by online capabilities and an increasing abundance of data access as well as the breakdown of geographic barriers for businesses i can only believe that many more graduates such as yourselves will quickly rise to senior business leadership positions in the futureincreasingly organisations will turn to your business skills to assist and drive change and to search for value from the changing environmentyou are indeed in an enviable positionwith such great career settings i want to encourage you to set your sights high take the bold decisions and don’t be afraid to make changes and to make mistakesas future business leaders you are uniquely placed to help australia benefit and build on its place in the global economy do not underestimate your influence and impact on organisations and people and do not take the responsibility lightly exercise your influence in a considered and positive manner put all you have learned to practice but of course recognise there is still much to learnin this context i would like to share my experience with you in relation to some of the factors which will influence the level of success you will enjoy from your careersin business there are  key attributes which i believe define the high performing individuals and teamsfirstly passion this means you strive challenge and innovate for better outcomes by approaching tasks with an enthusiastic and energetic mindset and questioning the status quosecondly judgement this is knowing when to think and consult or when to get on with itjudgement necessarily means owning your decisions and taking corrective action as needed learning from past decisions as well as empowering others in line with their capabilityby combining these two attributes with a strong value set embracing respect accountability sincerity and humility will put you firmly on the path to a highly rewarding and satisfying careeron your behalf today i would like to thank all the uts staff who have been dedicated to providing you with the best degree possible today we should also reflect on the success of uts as we acknowledge its role as a major university over the past  years and its high standing both in australia and worldwidefinally we should sincerely thank your family and friends for their support and encouragement which has enabled you to be here
