at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode a brief questionandanswer session will follow the formal presentation as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to your host mike monahan senior vice president of external relations mr monahan you may begin michael j monahan  ecolab inc thank you hello everyone and welcome to ecolabs first quarter conference call with me today is doug baker ecolabs chairman and ceo and dan schmechel our cfo as discussed in our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarters results and our outlook are available on ecolabs website at ecolabcominvestor please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference the discussion and the slides including estimates of future performance these are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent form k under item a risk factors and in our posted materials we also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release starting with a brief overview of the quarter continued new business gains and product introductions drove acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth in our global institutional global industrial and other segments during the first quarter these were partially offset by a narrowing sales decline in the energy segment product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work more than offset the impact of higherthanforecast delivered product costs as well as soft economies and challenging end markets these along with lower interest expense a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding yielded the first quarters  adjusted earnings per share increase moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales for our global institutional global industrial and other segments grew  but were partially offset by a narrowing global energy sales decline regional fixed currency sales growth was led by latin america and north america reported operating margins decreased  basis points adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased  basis points as higher energy segment profits and the price and volume increase were more than offset by the impact of higher delivered product costs which include a  per share unfavorable currency hedge yearonyear comparison representing a  percentage point negative impact to eps growth in the quarter adjusted fixed currency operating income rose  the operating income gain along with lower tax rate lower interest expense and fewer shares outstanding yielded a  increase in first quarter  adjusted earnings per share we continue to see sluggish economic growth higher delivered product costs and gradually improving fundamentals in the energy markets and we expect these to generally continue through the balance of the year we are again working aggressively to drive our growth winning new business using our innovative new products and a sharp focus on sales execution as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates we expect improving volume growth and pricing across all of our business segments and look for that to overcome delivered product cost headwinds which slow as the year progresses and yield operating income growth we expect this focus on top line growth and margin expansion will yield full year adjusted diluted earnings per share which we forecast in the  to  per share range in  rising  to  with the second half results outpacing the first half we expect second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the  to  range up  to  and now heres doug baker with some comments douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc thank you mike so the first quarter was certainly not our prettiest but better than it looks and it does set us up for the full year delivery most things are on track pricing new business innovation investments industrial business acceleration energy recovery and fx stabilization but we did have a few surprises raws moved faster than forecast in the quarter and we do believe will be net higher for the year the good news is our pricing also has traction and we believe will catch up on a dollar basis this year institutional sales were also soft they were softer than expected but theyre better than they look so if you take and adjust the base business for swisher exits which we have done because of margin and other issues were really growing at about  in north america and  globally thats still slower than last year and slower than we expected the issue primarily is that us restaurant samestore consumption is down  you got to go sell more business were not going to fix the us foodservice market by ourselves and the division is already all over this driving significant new business campaigns and weve got the right team to do this in total q was solid not brilliant but leaves us in position to deliver the year the most important perspective on  to understand is that the second half eps ramp up is not nearly as steep as it appears we need to do  eps in the second half to reach our midpoint or  the first half run rate is really an  when you control for hedge and other nonrecurring install and other expenses so we still have a stepup but its much more manageable moving from an  to a  than what may appear to be from like a  or  to a  so the stepup requires sales to move from  in the first half to  in the second half which i believe is quite doable here are couple of facts energy trajectory this year  growth really in the first half we expect them to grow at least at  in the second half if you assume that then iio  needs to go from  in the first to  in the second we already have industrial sales trajectory moving its accelerating institutional in the second half will lap the swisher exits and weve got a clearer view of timing on known wins and losses throughout the businesses all of which are quite favorable to us net were making progress we believe were on track to go deliver a solid year and so while q wont win many style points we do believe were going to deliver a more ecolablike performance in  so with that ill turn it back to mike michael j monahan  ecolab inc thanks doug that concludes our formal remarks as a final note before we start qa we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the national restaurant association show in chicago on monday may  looking further ahead we also plan to hold our  investor day on thursday september  if you have any questions please contact my office and now operator please begin the questionandanswer period questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session thank you our first question is from the line of gary bisbee with rbc please proceed with your questions gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc hey guys good afternoon i guess id love to get some more color on the institutional business and the deceleration there if swisher bleeding off some of the lower margin volumes there is a big piece of it i would have thought maybe that margins would have been better and yet they were down quite a bit so any more color on the revenue and any color on the margin to help us think how that trends the rest of the year thank you douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i think within the institutional margin youve got some of the noise i referred to earlier you certainly have some impact from hedging not in the us margin particular but us global or in institutional global and you also have investments that have been made particularly in plant equipment to enable a new platform for solids which is now coming online its in the margin but not yet fully or even partially utilized in some cases as were rolling that out late in the second quarter thats also making it a little worse and then we have a few rollouts where weve got the mechanical equipment expense or the me expense in the business but not the sales yet so i would say if you look at institutional margin it looks like its down but theres a number of things which really i think mask the underlying trend in their margin and we expect over the year that their margin is going to start showing daylight between this year and last year pricing in institutional was the best performer last year and theyre continuing on a very solid track this year so were not really worried ultimately in institutional margins gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc and just the – any more color on the revenue deceleration douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well gary i mean it really comes down to mostly same stores consumption in us restaurant and that weve dealt with many times in the past restaurants come in and out in terms of how successful theyre being i dont think were the only ones feeling this weve tended to manage this better than others the division got on it early they have a number of what i would call highenergy new business efforts underway that are gaining traction and thats the only way you sell through this is you got to go gain more business we by ourselves cant force the restaurants to consume more and theyre really just reflecting the softness in their business gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc great and then the quick followup with energy it sounds like on the verge of rebounding can you just review for us how youre thinking today about operating leverage coming back to the business i know theres some cost youd stepped aside from thats probably come back but how strong could incremental margins be as we look to the next  months and the revenue rebounds there thank you douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah typically what weve seen in the past and what we expect this year is lets call this the very early innings of a recovery and we typically see really margin recovery and a lot of flowthrough more in year two than in year one and thats simply because as youre starting to see volume increase youre simultaneously seeing some of the raw materials increase pricing lags a bit and so you end up with increasing sales but not significant and sometimes even nearterm decelerating margin before it starts expanding again you also have some costs youve got to add back the largest cost this year that were going to have to add back is compensation so its a business because of performance it hasnt earned bonus over the last several years they are on track to earn bonus this year and so weve got to rebuild that were also rebuilding some other comp where it matters because the industry heats up it becomes much more competitive in total for the year i think were pretty much where we thought we would be last call and that is were going to have some yearonyear sales growth in this business really its going to be a second half story as i alluded to in my opening remarks and we also expect to be about even to have some minor potential accretion on the operating income line too as we start rebuilding comp and that somewhat offsets the volume benefit that were going to see gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc thank you operator our next question is from the line of john quealy with canaccord please proceed with your questions john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc hey good afternoon first question diving back into the foot traffic topic inside specialty and quick serve did you also see that foot traffic issue or was it as youve reported more of a timing issue off a tough comp last year douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah in specialty its more a timing issue and its not even just the comp weve got a lot of new business thats being put on in specialty right now theyre going to have a very solid year the quarter is really just sort of an aberration weve gone through this as ive always described thats sort of a – the way they feed their village is through hunting elephants and theyve landed several but they just havent brought them back to the village theyre coming so even there youve got some of the pressure as a consequence of theyve installed a lot of these accounts but they havent yet started consuming our product in the first quarter theyre starting to in the second quarter as they had to run out the old competitive product first so that also put pressure on the first quarter margin theres going to be a little less pressure from that in the second quarter but still some and all that pressure goes away in the second half as we realize the full effects of the new business volume in specialty john salvatore quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay thanks and as a followup doug a broader question more on people sounds like youre adding and rebuilding some channel in the core businesses equipment care seems like its constrained a bit just trying to get talent for those folks and then energy were adding back some compensation when you think about broader compensation costs for the platform into  in what could be a rising wage environment talk about the puts and takes and how youre planning for that thanks guys douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i dont think were going to see dramatic wage inflation in  versus  i mean its been fairly steady even over the last couple of years i mean many of the markets that we compete in are pretty full employment and weve got several things going for us one weve got a great employment brand story weve got great track record of growth were on the right stuff stuff that matters to people who are joining the workforce in terms of our ability to talk about clean water safe food abundant energy and healthy environments it really does resonate with people were trying to attract and in terms of how do you offset the wage pressure its really through efficiency programs so as weve talked weve invested a lot in field technology thats bearing fruit and enabling us to help our team do more and handle more as we take the admin off them and automate that kind of work we have many more programs like that now that we have the installed base the field technology in their hands and thats in the base business or the run rate so those are really the steps we have to take but i wouldnt be signaling that theres going to be some fundamental shift in wage pressures weve had wage pressure we expect to continue to have some wage pressure but i dont think its going to be at a dramatically different trajectory operator thank you our next question is from the line of david ridleylane with bank of america please proceed with your question david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch sure now that youve broken out the life sciences business can you maybe talk about mediumterm expectations for revenue growth in that segment and also would you describe it as an aboveaverage margin business a business for you today or – what are your outlooks on margin as well douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah life sciences business chase  is a big market its very well designed for us its dominated by large multinationals who have significant hygiene needs as you might imagine with a change in their business model where theyre going from longrun to shorterrun drugs and even cosmetics changeover is important and so our ability to help manage changeover time water consumption hygiene all fits very much their needs and our ability to do it consistently across the globe is also important so as we look at this it already is a higherthanaverage margin business we would expect it to remain so given the fit for what we do and the critical needs that our customers have in this area its going to act a bit like kay and then its going to be lumpy meaning were going after large customers they arent all going to come on smoothly so i think youre going to see some knockout quarters and other quarters that may be single digits not double digits but in total our expectation for this business is its a doubledigit organic growth business we will look to see if there are smart acquisitions to be made but thats to be seen were not relying on it fundamentally weve got the capability we need and we can build what we dont and were getting after this so were quite excited about this market and the potential david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch sure and as a followup europe appeared to be a pretty weak region for you in the first quarter would you put europe in that category of things that you expect to have a second half improvement or is this a bit more macro related and should continue to be sluggish here for the full year douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc no i think europe will do better as the year goes on i mean europe is a combination of somewhat the environment but i would also say i think theres some things we can do better in europe and certainly weve got a couple of businesses pulling down the overall i mean as it stands what i would say is we expect europe to have modest sales growth and modest oi ratio improvement for the year and what were going to work hard to do is improve that outlook as we go forward i dont think its going to dominate the news in terms of company performance and i think the forward quarter is going to be better than this one david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of manav patnaik with barclays please proceed with your questions gregory bardi  barclays capital inc hi this is actually greg calling on for manav i just wanted to ask for a little more color on the growth trajectory within industrial and just any changes that youre seeing in terms of lapping the headwinds whether its in heavy or mining douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i would say heavy in total ill get down to organic had growth in this quarter and we expect it to accelerate mining narrowed its decline i mean it was low single digits better than the fourth which is clearly better than the third wed expect mining to start showing growth maybe as early as this quarter more likely in the third quarter so im not sure its all that important but its clearly making the progress we expect and we expect heavy to continue to accelerate throughout the year the comps for water for heavy and mining in particular improve throughout the year and so wed expect youre going to see overall acceleration in water as a consequence gregory bardi  barclays capital inc okay thanks and then i know its a bit early with the anios deal but just some early thoughts on how that integration is going and how you guys are looking at the opportunity set douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc under the heading you got to get the big ones right we are so we really – weve liked anios and admired it for a long time and for good reason i think everything that were learning is what a quality company and business it is its a lot easier to integrate a business that operates well because in all the new stuff that you can bring to them and also the ideas you can take from them for the other businesses its going on a firm foundation thats certainly what we have there so yeah anios its growing were seeing the operating leverage we expected were on track we believe to deliver good synergy numbers my hope is that we exceed it this year well see but yeah we feel very good about it still early days but its off to the right start gregory bardi  barclays capital inc all right thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your questions john roberts  ubs securities llc thank you any thoughts on competing against diversey or ge water under the new owners im curious whether thats behind the back half of the year new win improvement that youre talking about douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well i would certainly say i think anytime a company goes through a transition like the one that either ge water or diversey has to go through ie a big ownership change certainly causes distraction weve seen it in the past we expect to see it going forward and we arent shy about working to capitalize on it we feel its our responsibility so we have – lets just say i talked about the institutional efforts we have very strong efforts everywhere to get after new business we had a good first quarter from a new business standpoint we had a very significant ratio against our key competitors in terms of winloss i would say stronger ratios than we had in  which were quite strong as well so were all over this i wouldnt say thats the reason were confident we can accelerate but its certainly another i guess thought to put in the back so well accelerate john roberts  ubs securities llc and then costs are up for caustic chlorine propylene derivatives is that a big part of the cost headwind that youre talking about in the release or is it just one other thing among a lot of things douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i think caustic and propylene in particular caustics up this year for us its a main raw material in our institutional fb businesses in particular we also have propylene which is expected to peak in the second quarter as new capacity comes on as we go forward and i think propylene runup was the surprise that we had early in this year versus expectations caustic we expected to see go up and it did go up john roberts  ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question is from the line of laurence alexander with jefferies please proceed with your questions laurence alexander  jefferies llc good afternoon so two questions one can you give a little bit more detail on the retention issues you flagged with the technicians for the equipment repair services business and secondly with the run rate that youre seeing in the back half of this year to get there you flagged a bunch of sort of oneoffish factors that you think will slip away and let the underlying momentum show up as were thinking about the bridge into  do you think the back half is a good run rate or should some of these oneoff lumpiness factors come back into the bridge douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well ill do the second first question no i think the second half itd be a more realistic run rate model for what we would expect in  in the first i mean the first had – the single largest impact is hedging and hedging is going to account for literally like a  point with a point drag on eps  percentage points  basis points in the first quarter its going to be  in the second so  for the first half all by itself it does go away its simply – these were foreign hedges that we put on in a rising dollar environment its really not that there are huge negative costs in the first half were just comparing against a yearago period where you had very favorable contributions from the hedging activity as the dollar was rising so you got to go – we normalize we look at our gp progression exhedge to understand really whats going on underneath and its all the stuff you would expect which is why were very quite confident in the second half so we do not expect next year to have yearonyear hedging impacts simply because we arent benefiting this year from them so theres nothing really to compare against the others were sort of oddities and normally you dont get this many stacked up but a lot of its good news were investing in new technologies for institutional solids we have a lot of new business wins where we have a lot of installs focused on a specific quarter where were not realizing the volume from those installs but youre realizing the cost we typically dont have this many stacked up at one time and in a couple quarter period i dont mind it but it does make gp look artificially low for a period of time and we know that goes away based on our history this is unusual if it happened again i would explain it again and be happy about it again in terms of gcs its really not a retention change retentions always been a bit of a challenge there in the field workforce we spend more than other people training our team they get poached at times by competitors theres not a change in retention of our employee base whats changed is just how fast weve been able to add on new people to replace those that are leaving and there we got a little bit behind in q and are catching up on q i dont think this is going to be an ongoing challenge for the business its just a bit of a nearterm challenge laurence alexander  jefferies llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of pj juvekar with citigroup please proceed with your questions pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc yes hi good afternoon your qsr trends were a little slow this quarter compared to last year and some recent trends can you talk a little bit about that a lot of new restaurant chains that are opening up and taking share away from old chains and just tell us how youre positioned with the new chains douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah no i think our qsr business im not worried about at all youre right the quarter was a little bit soft in terms of growth rate i mean but its still growing at what five and change but its going to accelerate throughout the year weve sold a bunch of business in that – in qsr and weve rolled it out a lot of it were going to start seeing the volume coming in in the second quarter and well enjoy  of it kind of at run rate in the second half so its just a timing issue its nothing fundamentally wrong or to worry about our qsr business pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc and also your energy business the peak was in  do you see that business going back to that level at some point im not looking for a year or a date or is there something change structurally in that business where customers are using less chemicals per barrel of oil or something like that is it all cyclical or you think there may be some structural change that has happened thank you douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i dont think weve seen the peak sales and oi in our energy business for all time by any stretch so yeah i think ultimately well reach and i would expect to exceed those levels down the road has there been change in the industry yeah i would say all kinds and in some areas yeah its more efficient were more efficient it can take less chemical in some cases but there are other applications that take more the net story that weve always talked about which is easy oil transitioning to hardertoget oil is still fundamentally the driver and that has not changed so that market continues to become more attractive over time as exploration picks up which really isnt this year but we think more meaningfully in  and really in  theyre going to have to go after the hardertofind oil because the easy oils gone and when they do that the average if you will consumption of our technology per barrel will continue to rise and thats the fundamentals in the business so we plan on continuing to gain share the market will recover its not going to be identical to the business that we had in  because that industry continues to evolve and will continue to evolve but i think were in great shape to evolve with it and continue to increase our competitiveness pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc thank you operator our next question is coming from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your questions christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you can you just walk us through the recent improvements in food  beverage and also whether or not you believe youll see the full benefits of the strengthening north american sales team throughout the balance of this year or do you think thats all going to also be a theme in  as well douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah look i mean several things yeah i think fb you saw acceleration we expect continued improvement throughout the year as we go forward so we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half the team has been investing in more corporate account head count i think wisely that business has been successful over a long period of time probably analysis the team did said hadnt been expanding the corporate accounting probably as fast as weve been expanding share and if we want to continue to have capacity there we got to add to it which theyve been doing and i think its already showing that it was the right move so i dont know i remain – yeah i would expect that business to be better this year and knowing what we know now i would say we should at least hold that growth rate moving into  christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc great and just very quickly on the pest elimination business you mentioned you saw strong growth in north america and apac but can you just comment on the key puts and takes in latin america and then europe in both the short and long term and also just the overall longerterm view of that business is that a segment which youd consider doing ma in as well as any other initiatives thank you douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah well we love the pest business and so absolutely on your ma question and weve done ma and we would be a happy acquirer of a good business at a reasonable price its the second part of that equation thats been hard to find recently people have been paying in our mind too rich of multiples in pest pest is attractive for many reasons but one of its real attractiveness is its return on invested capital it doesnt require a lot of capital the only way you screw that equation up is you pay too much for a business now youve got too much invested and youve lost the heart or the secret to that business in a sense so were going to be wise people as it comes to ma in terms of whats going on its really more a europe story latin americas a relatively small business and europe is just sort of – you get paid as you serve our service calendar was a little out of whack in the first quarter theres catchup activity underway in the second quarter and so im confident ultimately that all comes back around and im not really worried about the pest business i think those guys are doing the right things and theyve got good momentum christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you operator our next question is from the line of tim mulrooney with william blair please proceed with your questions tim m mulrooney  william blair  co llc yeah good morning i know the drilling business was up double digits in the fourth quarter how did that do in the first quarter douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah it was up double digits in the first quarter i mean grew faster obviously than in the fourth tim m mulrooney  william blair  co llc okay did the completion business the other part of wellchem did that follow suit in the first quarter is that continuing to improve as well or is that piece of the business still in kind of a holding period douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah wellchem was up just north of  in the first quarter we expect it to continue to accelerate based on our projection of whats going to happen in terms of rigs and rig activity tim m mulrooney  william blair  co llc got it thanks and just one more shifting gears to your global industrial margins it looked like they took a step back in the first quarter i think down  basis points on a fixed currency basis was that driven by the resegmentation or just generally what are the main puts and takes there douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i would say the big noise in the industrial business was hedge particularly in the water business if you get out – so in water i think it was off  basis points and  basis points of that was a hedge so thats the dominant story there and thats a little bit just kind of onetime comparison if you take it out you start seeing the natural trajectory you would expect to see in our industrial gross profit margin they are getting pricing pricing accelerated in the first quarter for our industrial businesses versus what they were able to get last year so theyre on track in terms of doing what they need to do to offset raws once the hedge comes off which is after second quarter i think youll see a more natural view of their gp tim m mulrooney  william blair  co llc okay got it thank you operator our next question is from the line of mike harrison with seaport global please proceed with your questions michael j harrison  seaport global securities llc hi good afternoon doug this may be the first press release ive ever seen that referred to the angolan kwanza as a component of the fx impact wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about within the energy business north america growing faster than international how does that really affect the business is it really just where – in drilling and completion where you guys have a significantly higher share within north america or does that extend to the production chemicals as well or the downstream piece and then also curious about the margin impact of that is the international side higher margin than the north american side of energy douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah theres not a significant gross profit difference one to the other and so heres whats going on i mean you would see this in other energyrelated businesses so north america went into whatever you want to call that a recession clearly much earlier than the balance of the world and theyre coming out of it earlier than the other parts of the world so if you will the vs just arent lined up us versus international its really driven by structure of the industry much of the international business or big hunks of it are owned by governments its used to pay their bills so when oil dropped they actually worked to up their production that works for a while but without new capex you cant keep at that pace forever so youre starting to see that curtail and it will continue to curtail until they start drilling again us business dropped off dramatically in terms of its productivity when the oil price dropped because its more privately owned and so it reacts to the market and doesnt chase lowermargin business with more dollars which other parts of the world will but now youre seeing it rebound as the oil price rebounds and theyre starting to chase the opportunity the big picture in the oil market i would say is that youre starting to see a rebalance of supply and demand so demand this year is projected to be  growth and production right now in the first quarter was down  so thats the stuff that everybody needed to see were going to see oil bounce around we always thought we talked  to  we didnt expect a big recovery this year in terms of oil price we think thats more a  story we also dont see oil falling off a cliff either and so i think theres slow improvement in activity which were seeing is – what were going to continue to see until we start seeing prices more in the s and north and theres a great deal of confidence that thats really going to stay when you see that i think youre going to see a big upturn in activity and thats when youre going to see even faster growth than were projecting now for our business good news is though our energy business its no longer a drag on the business i think itd be minorly accretive but just being neutral is a significant improvement over the last two years and going forward this business can be a very strong piece of our growth story michael j harrison  seaport global securities llc all right and then turning over to the institutional division i was wondering if you could comment on the impact of the travel ban as well as the strong dollar on the hospitality industry and the tourism industry in north america douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i dont – i would say this room demand isnt – it slowed a bit in north america it was better in europe and parts around the world so i just dont think the lodging isnt really the story i really think its what we talked about earlier what we saw that was unusual and correlates with sort of what we see in our metrics was consumption was down in us restaurants it wasnt negative it was just much slower growth than weve seen in the past and thats a hole or volume that we thought we were going to see that we didnt see but we believe its overcomeable by getting after and stepping on new business activity which the teams done and i would just say this our us institutional team is very strong theyre very good when focused and theyre very focused operator thank you our next question is from the line of hamzah mazari with macquarie please proceed with your questions hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc yes thank you the first question is just around ma given some of the larger assets have changed hands already maybe just refresh us on your ability or appetite to do a larger deal versus sort of return of cash at this stage douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah on our appetite wed be very comfortable doing a deal of size as long as we feel its going to be a good deal for us the story about the asset just as when is quite complicated so i would just say that doesnt change my view i think i even said a year ago id be surprised if we do a big deal in the very near term and quite surprised if we dont do one over the next five six years i think that my view still holds there so our appetite isnt diminished at all i think we just go in eyes wide open and try to fully understand what the risks are and the challenges are in any deal and as a consequence what price makes sense hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc great and just a followup you mentioned earnings were backend loaded obviously theres a lag in terms of your pricing could you just remind us how many of your contracts are costplus is there a greater lag on pricing in certain segments or business lines versus others thank you douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc really in energy its about  waters just a little south of that in terms of percent those are where we have the big costplus contracts theres a few others spattered across the other segments but theyre not significant but yeah those will always lag i mean they lag going down and they lag going up simply because youve got to realize the cost in your business before youre going to be – before youre able to price for them hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of dmitry silversteyn with longbow research please proceed with your questions dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question a lot of the questions have been answered but let me just follow up on the strength that you guys are seeing in paper and textile particularly paper the market that i know you werent very enamored with when you bought nalco but since theyve been doing better and picking up momentum over the last several quarters so im just wondering if its just better execution or if the markets coming back and kind of what youre feeling about that business these days douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well since all my prior stance seems to have worked im going to tell you im still not enamored with the business because it seems to spur them on now i would say thats not really – where we were on that is i just said as a standalone we probably wouldnt have bought it but as a business that came along it was a pretty darn good business in many respects we havent changed our feeling on it its got a great team and i think the team has gotten better so how are they growing it its called the oldfashioned way new business theyve had new technology theyre gaining share theyre doing smart things in terms of getting their portfolio to be more focused on where you see growth in that industry like tissue towel and boxes versus newsprint and other materials so those have been smart moves they dont happen overnight so its been an ongoing effort so yeah youve seen sales acceleration as they keep selling new business theyre going to keep seeing sales acceleration and i think theyve managed the challenges successfully so i dont – thats the story there textile is not that fundamentally different if you sell new business good things happen and if you dont they dont dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc the restaurant comment you made about sort of foot traffic not coming back as strongly or being maybe not down but certainly slower weve heard some version of that not just from you but from other industry participants going back to really the recession if not all the way back to  is there a secular trend here that people are just not eating out as much around the world and should we start thinking about this industry as basically being a flattish industry where any growth you guys get is a bonus or not douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i mean samestore sales look i dont think is the singular metric that drives our business – or excuse me traffic traffics been down i think every year since  i keep asking the team is there one person left to walk into our restaurant based on these metrics clearly if you look at the sales in that industry they were also up over most of those years and yeah there are changes going on in that industry theyre not dramatic i dont think theyre going to hit huge inflection points but we watch them so certainly theres higher percent of takeout than there was  years ago id expect in  years therell be even a higher takeout than there is right now so you see some of these changes over time with that said the challenges in that industry simultaneously continue to increase people continue to get into that business start new concepts grow their business food safety clean labels ie organic food without additives and the like all these things are also impacting that business and our customers and our ability in food safety is more important even today than it was  years ago and  years ago so i guess – i think when i take all of the shifts that are going on in that industry and net it out its still quite an attractive market for us both in the us and around the world and we have significant share possibilities not only in the us but in particular around the world that we continue to get after dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc last question sort of bookkeeping question what should be the tax – whats a good tax rate assumption for you guys for the year is it the  that you did in this quarter douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i think weve said  to  dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc  to  okay thank you operator our next question is from the line of andy wittmann with robert w baird please proceed with your questions andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc great thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask on energy in particular around the pricing clearly you guys have had to concede a little bit of price and i think that was even a bit of a factor in q doug i was just wondering when the price comps and the healthier customers get to the point where that could inflect at least neutral if not positive is that part of your forecast for the rest of this year when you talk about the flat – the top line being flat to up modestly douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yes so last year we talked we had probably lost about  points of top line to price in that business and it started getting modestly better as we went throughout the year last year we saw continued improvement in the first quarter second half i would say it would be neutral to positive on price andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc interesting and then just regarding the doubledigit increases on the drilling side of the business theres just been this trend in the industry to make kind of the fracked wells in particular in north america consume more sand and make them much more efficient than theyve been even a year or two ago does the same go for chemical are you – is your doubledigit increases in your drilling revenues driven by the number of wells or the amount of chemical thats consumed by the new technologies being used in the wells douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i would say right now its more a reflection of rig count increase and activity increase yeah i would say several things i mean what weve been working on products and programs and have them that reduces the need for companies conducting a frac in terms of how much water they need how much sand they need et cetera to conduct this less is better and wed rather cannibalize ourselves than get cannibalized some instances it takes less chemical and there are other applications where it would take more of our product to get that same result i think over time i mean this kind of shifting of how much technology it takes to get an end result i think if you look over any long period of time it typically gets more efficient we would expect that to continue to be true but challenges continue to grow and so the need for technology evolves so i had somebody try to say that frackings going to disappear and i do not think thats the way to think about it its going to continue to evolve and change but there are plenty of opportunities for us to introduce new programs that bring great benefit to those conducting a frac thats going to represent new opportunity for us even as others may dissipate slightly andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of shlomo rosenbaum with stifel please proceed with your questions shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi thank you most of my questions have been answered i just have a couple nits i want to ask about doug how do you feel about the organic growth in the healthcare business its definitely on a better trajectory than its been prior to this anios acquisition how do you feel about the existing business and the ability to improve the growth over there over the next several years douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah well healthcare yeah clearly has improved i mean its a  underlying organic rate if you peel out anios and the other and look i think the teams doing a very good job i mean they went through and are doing a lot of integration work that started even before obviously the close of anios they continue to drive and accelerate their underlying business so the work that we did and the work that team did around getting clarity around the program clarity around the message for customers adding resources where they needed them weve continued to add additional talent into that team and its paying dividends so where am i yeah im proud that the teams been able to build this up to  and then the other side of me is greedy and i think that teams capable of doing even more and its only because i think theyre great so  is good  is better thats our focus shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and just a followup where does the swisher integration stand were still calling out costs for the integration and stuff on that a little while after i would have expected douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah us too it took us longer to exit the hygiene business than we had planned which delayed our exit from a number of facilities because we had to continue to operate it until we could move it and so it was a couple quarters after we had thought we were going to be able to move it so that delayed a number of things thats why youre seeing some of the charges come through now versus say third quarter of last year et cetera in total i think the swisher noise is really going to be out of the business come third quarter as we go through so then its just going to be a completely natural part the exiting and the comparison with hygiene and all the other stuff will be out of the base shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of rosemarie morbelli with gabelli  company please proceed with your questions rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gresearch llc thank you good afternoon everyone doug i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the different categories in food  beverage mostly trends that you see in dairy in farms in protein can you help me understand what is happening there douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well the most significant probably underlying change would be in dairy clearly dairy was under a lot of pressure the markets improved somewhat i dont know that all dairy producers would call it a victory yet but it certainly helps as weve gone through food continues to be pressured by consolidation theres a lot of obviously big headline acquisitions that have been made in that industry some others that seem to be contemplated but not consummated and brewery beverage is strong and thats more a continuing story so the inflection one would be mostly in our dairy business rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gresearch llc do you see that decline in dairy being impacted by the fact that there is negative advertisement justifyingly so about cows milk its not supposed to be good for you is that having an impact douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc i dont – you know what i dont believe so i honestly havent seen those advertisements but of course i live in a state that borders wisconsin so we wouldnt likely be airing them in this market so anyway no i would say if anything dairy has gotten better because it was so depressed i have not seen any impact from the advertising you talked about rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gresearch llc okay and then lastly you said that the world of energy has changed a lot since  and you expect that it will become substantially bigger over time how about the margin has the change affected the margins in one direction or another douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc i dont think we feel that our ability to earn the type of margins that we were earning or targeted has changed so the margins have been most impacted near term just by loss of volume on a fixed overhead base particularly in plants and so i think as this business comes back which we expect it to as we continue to roll out technology and the needs for technology continue to grow as old oil becomes new oil which is harder oil and needs more technology we think well continue to see margin expansion now thats all predicated on us being a great valueadded supplier to our customers only reason people are going to pay margin to us is if they get great value and i think our team understands that stuff we have on the drawing board we are quite pleased with stuff that were launching we think has got great runway so i mean we remain bullish about this business rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gresearch llc okay great thank you operator our next question is from the line of robert koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question christopher evans  goldman sachs  co hi doug this is chris evans on for bob i was wondering if you could describe some of the strategic rationale for carving out the life sciences division earlier you gave some pretty favorable organic growth estimates i was just wondering if you could also add in maybe some of the industry structures the competitors youll be going against and maybe your thoughts on inorganic opportunities in that new subsegment douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc well the reason we broke it out is it creates focus so previously weve been serving the life sciences industry in part from the fb business and in part from the healthcare business and both were doing a good job with the tools at hand but neither had a complete set of tools so if anything once we decided to do it we wondered why it took us so long thats a shot at myself so getting focused i mean think the kay business going after qsr textile going after textile we have many examples of this thats how we succeed so now weve got a freestanding business it was a significant investment last year and were still paying some of the incremental investment this year in the first half before we fully lap it and the second has enabled us to have dedicated corporate account teams dedicated marketing teams dedicated corporate account finance teams to really understand how to develop and position programs to specifically meet this industrys need the structure is multinationals which is what we like fragmented competitive set which is what we like so by and large what were competing against is a lot of regional folks who are offering services to this industry and so our ability to put together a global program we believe will give us the same kind of advantage here that it does in other industries we serve because certainly the pharma need for consistency you might imagine would be fairly high in areas that were serving so i dont know if that helps give you color big business plenty of opportunity we can grow without doing ma if we see ma that works well certainly be quite open to it christopher evans  goldman sachs  co thats great and then just you cited higher delivered cost across to your segments i was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on this specific breakdown on q and maybe the cadence of expectations how youd plan to address those for the remainder of the year douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i think if you look at – its kind of a combination of just underlying commodity costs starting to rise and then transaction costs and foreign currency that – because a lot of these are us dollar denominated so if im buying them in reals et cetera i got to pay a higher price given the devaluation over time we see that rising ironically peaking around the second quarter part of this is the propylene conversation we had earlier but still being somewhat a yearonyear drag in three and four which is not at the same level but overcome by pricing and i talked earlier that we have pricing traction pricing is never easy were getting it institutional i think was ahead on ramping up its pricing activity last year trying to get in front of the caustic moves and some of the other stuff they knew was coming and you see the industrial businesses now accelerating their pricing activity which they need to do given the increased raw materials facing them so i guess were confident were going to end up with some daylight between the costs we realize incremental on raws and fx related to raws and the pricing that were going to get christopher evans  goldman sachs  co thank you operator thank you our final question today is from the line of dan dolev with instinet please go ahead with your questions dan dolev  instinet llc hey thanks for taking my question can you talk a little bit about is there any chance that some of the weakness in institutional could be because of a tougher competitive environment i mean specifically we know at least some companies that used to be traditionally in other businesses like uniform rental are starting to make a bigger push into like hygiene and some of your legacy product can you maybe talk about that competitive environment thanks douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i guess – no i would not say – i mean look we do a lot of analysis on our business to understand retention new business acquisition and sort of current customer consumption retention really – i mean if you look at our historic retention rates i mean were under – were better retention rates than weve been historically in that business so if it was competitive activity you would see it in worsening retention rates and thats just not what were seeing as really the story the big dip is in kind of samestore consumption its not a loss of product placements if you will in those units its a loss of consumption across those products and thats the story so we arent – we dont believe that were infallible or unbeatable or anything else we pay a lot of attention to competition i just dont think thats the story dan dolev  instinet llc but do you even see that traditional uniform rental competitor in – when you compete for business or are they not in the same categories douglas m baker jr  ecolab inc yeah i dont know that thats really a huge piece of emphasis for them to be quite honest i mean they just made a large acquisition theyve been quite successful in the businesses theyre in i just – i dont know that thats really an avenue theyre going i dont know that it lends itself i mean thats a little bit – theyre a much better executor i would say theyre a good company does a very good job in the businesses theyre in but its hard to take people in one set of business and make them kitchen hygiene people just because theyre in the back of the restaurant that was swishers play it wasnt very successful although i grant you and i think the company youre talking about is a much better executor dan dolev  instinet llc i agree with that thank you very much operator thank you at this time i

ecolabs first quarter  earnings release conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host mr michael monahan senior vice president external relations thank you you may begin michael j monahan  senior vice president external relations thank you hello everyone and welcome to ecolabs first quarter conference call with me today are doug baker ecolabs chairman and ceo and dan schmechel our cfo a discussion of results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarters results and our outlook are available on ecolabs website at ecolabcominvestor please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference the discussion and slides include estimates of future performance these are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent form k under item a risk factors and in our posted materials we also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release starting with a brief overview of the quarter continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our global institutional industrial and other segments during the first quarter nearly offsetting a decline in global energy sales new business and ongoing cost efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion more than offsetting the impact of soft economies weak oil prices and currency headwinds these along with fewer shares outstanding drove the adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation while  is proving to be a challenging year we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs they delivered again in the first quarter and we expect them to deliver for the full year  looking to the second quarter we expect our global institutional industrial and other segments to continue to show solid acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth outpacing their markets in soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower results from our global energy business we look for the second quarter earnings per share to be in the  to  per share range with that range including approximately  per share or  of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the venezuela deconsolidation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth for the full year the global institutional industrial and other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed currency growth global energy segment expectations have softened global energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range down upper single digits versus last year while the dollar has weakened somewhat at this early point in the year we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for  to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment net we continue to expect to outperform our markets in  while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable aboveaverage earnings growth we expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the  to  range moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release reported first quarter earnings per share were  on an adjusted basis excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years first quarter  adjusted earnings per share decreased  to  reflecting an  or  currency headwind the adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings cost efficiencies and the lower share count our consolidated fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales were modestly lower as our global institutional industrial and other segments grew  but were offset by lower global energy sales regional sales growth was led by latin america and europe adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed strong growth expanding  basis points in s difficult environment we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs we are using our industryleading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and through these aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the  to  range reflecting a currency translation and venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately  or  consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half we look for our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the  to  per share range in summary despite a very challenging global economic and market environment we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in  we remain confident in our business our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years and now heres doug baker with some comments douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer thank you mike good afternoon everybody look we had a solid quarter were on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range all of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition and we continue to gain share in all of these areas for the year there are natural puts and takes we look at our institutional industrial and other business segments they have been above expectations at this point driven by new business innovation cost savings very good execution this is driving improving top line and improved margin performance energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected this will pass we continue to believe though that the upturn is really a  not a  story ie the oil and gas market upturn if we froze fx at todays rates fx would be less of a negative than planned would be roughly  versus  negative but given the fluidity of the fx situation brazil political environment youve got the british exit vote china etc we think its too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast importantly our forecast also continues to include significant investments in systems rd talent initiatives which are all in total greater than last year which i would remind you was greater than the prior year and is i think a very strong indication of our confidence in the future which is high and we believe for good reason so as we look at the future we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and fx will abate we dont know exactly when but they will pass even with them weve been doing well and outperforming markets we do know though that our plan and our position we think are spot on for the future so clean water safe food abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past  or  years we have a stronger competitive advantage position now we believe given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on co and water we also have very strong execution momentum our teams are on it theyre doing a great job theyre driving new business we had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences and geographies like mea and there are plenty more and finally we got a culture in the team that knows how to deliver for all these reasons we feel very good about where we are how were going to get through the year the position that were going to be in to drive continued growth beyond so thats my opening and with that ill turn it over to mike who will move on into qa michael j monahan  senior vice president external relations thanks doug that concludes our formal remarks operator would you please begin the questionandanswer period questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from gary bisbee with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc i guess the first question oil has rebounded a lot off the lows it doesnt sound like from you or others that thats going to be enough to really impact the trend in the energy business but how should we think about raw materials it seems like thats probably somewhat more of a headwind by the second half of the year assuming prices hold and is it fair to say that the energy business isnt seeing any real benefit yet from the move off the bottom thanks douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think the recent move in oil price i think look the best predictions i read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand for the summer it was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand and nobody really believed that was going to happen until towards the end of this year and until that happens youre not going to really we believe have sustained improvement in oil price or increase – maybe we shouldnt call it improvement – increase in oil price in terms of raw materials i guess our forecast has always had two views one that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our energy services business thats in our forecast so in the back half we have some uptick in raws included not monstrous because we still have favorability in the first half but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market starts correcting and healing so thats our view right now i dont think youre going to see material increase in activity which is whats really needed to drive our energy services volume until at the earliest very late this year but most likely we arent going to see the impact until  gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc okay great and then the followup you cited that energy is maybe a little bit weaker but have you seen anything else change much in the last quarter and i guess im just thinking through the thought process of not flowing through the fx i understand theres a lot of uncertainty but a lot of data has pointed to weaker global growth are you seeing that impacting the businesses or are you staying conservative at this point thank you douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think if you look in our total business mix we called out mining is under a lot of pressure which isnt a real surprise given everything else you read and this is really the water technologies that we sell into the worlds mining operations i mean that business is down double digits so youll see spotty things china particularly on the heavy industrial side is soft so our business reflects what youre going to read daytoday about the global economy but overall the model as it has always proven is fairly resilient and so we have puts and takes we also have pretty strong business performance from institutional in north america in particular there are oil dividends which weve talked about which are certainly lower raw materials which you see flowing through our iio segments which is one of the reasons gross profit is up the other reason obviously is innovation so i mean i dont think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate i think the year and even the energy market softness i would say its worse than we anticipated i would still think energy is likely going to come in with the range we talked about its just going to be at the bottom end of it gary bisbee  rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator our next question is from nate brochmann with william blair please proceed with your question nate j brochmann  william blair  co llc yeah good hello everyone so doug just kind of following up on that with the energy question like do you feel that like at this point while we might have the lingering behavioral impacts and obviously still some pricing pressure as you help out your customers but do you feel like at this point that you kind of that were in the later innings of getting your arms around kind of that were getting close to a true bottom in that douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i mean were certainly in the later innings im not unwise enough to pretend to know if the bottom is  days ago or  days in front of us or  months in front of us but certainly were in the later innings and i think the data i pay most attention to is where are we on the supplydemand curve theres virtually no inventory storage capabilities globally for oil so this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand and that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year and i believe ultimately thats going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns so were what are we  months into this and were saying probably have six to nine months to go so certainly were in the later innings nate j brochmann  william blair  co llc okay great and then with the other businesses too like particularly on the institutional side on a relative basis i definitely get the relative strength compared to the industry trends but with the end markets still kind of being a little bit sluggish i was wondering what its going to take to get that institutional business more in that sustained plus growth range that i know that were hopeful for like do we need the end markets to do that or are there certain initiatives in place that do that by themselves even in the sluggish end market environment thanks douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i would say in institutional nate i mean the institutional business itself or even the sector institutional business was north of  last year it was  in this quarter but expected to be plus for the year and that was really a quarter phenomenon that business is operating in the  to  band that weve talked about and i think the team has done a good job and the team will tell you and ill tell you they still have a lot of opportunity to get after growth opportunities and margin opportunities particularly outside of north america which theyre focusing on so that business is running as well as its run in terms of its financial performance for many many years operator our next question is from laurence alexander with jefferies please proceed with your question laurence alexander  jefferies llc good afternoon two quick ones can you flesh out a little bit the comments about latin america and secondly can you give us an update on how youre thinking about the ma pipeline particularly any chances to increase your footprint in the emerging markets douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer ill do it the expanded footprint in emerging markets weve operated now obviously for a while and we talked about  before the merger and were plus post merger however we didnt have equal capabilities in all these markets and in particular we made a breakout investment move in mea about  months ago and this cost us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year but it has driven improved results previously we really ran mea as part of europe our history whenever we make these breakout organizational moves we did it with food retail breaking it out from kay qsr we did it many years ago with healthcare outside of what was then called epp which is our janitorial business there are plenty other examples here both participants benefit improved focus and i think youre seeing that mea has accelerated since weve broken it out we have increased focus we have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities and i would also point out europe has done better since weve taken mea out as well just simply it drives increased focus on the region thats left so that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term latin america we grew by basically  or  i guess in the quarter we continue to do well in a region thats obviously under a lot of pressure brazil being the most notable headline owner right now and i would say its two things i think weve always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas our food and beverage business which is important throughout all those economies is up  even our paper business through some big wins is having a very strong quarter water is up double digit down in that market as well and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in latin america for a long time to come and thats what our focus has been and is paying off laurence alexander  jefferies llc thank you operator our next question is from david ridleylane with bank of america please proceed with your question david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch sure within the energy segment did you see any change in client behavior around pricing and just to check would you still expect pricing in the production side of that segment to still see a modest decline in  douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well i just – we didnt see a change in customer behavior towards pricing which would be accepting price increases so no they are under pressure and this is not unusual and they are certainly putting pressure on us you got competitive pressure as well pricing still remains in total in the lowsingle digits and we expected to be there for the year but its real pressure and a challenge and what i would say is thats an average so youve got some much more material givebacks in certain situations in other areas where weve been able to hold price either because we have very very unique technology and a high need or its a customer not under the same pressure given their geographic position so i would expect youll continue to see that i think the other things that were seeing in that market i dont know if theyre surprising customers are turning off programs and services weve expected some were seeing a little more than we expected but thats always a temporary issue and so people will take some risks particularly in north america where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear and the business outside of north america continues to perform at a much higher rate simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else people are typically pumping oil to meet builds not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money so wed expect to continue to see that were remaining physically disciplined some of the pain is selfinduced last year we had only  million in bad debt writeoffs in the energy business we expect it to be greater this year but still in the singledigit millions which is pretty low given the size of that business and a lot of it is because the energy team has been very very acutely aware of the risks there were putting customers on cashondemand quite early were staying out of some bankruptcy situations customers where we dont believe theres a future either before or after bankruptcy we are walking from if they wont go to cash on delivery etc so those are the type of steps that were taking and they accentuate some shortterm pain but ultimately even within the year we think theyre going to be fiscally responsible moves because were just going to avoid some big writeoffs and other challenges david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch sure thank you for the – for all that color just a quick addon to that since you spoke about the trends outside the us being positive what was the net new business contribution or the share gain contribution that you saw in energy in the first quarter thank you douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah net  million roughly david e ridleylane  bank of america merrill lynch thank you very much operator our next question is from john quealy with canaccord genuity please proceed with your question john quealy  canaccord genuity inc hi good afternoon first question in energy can we hold ebit margins here in the back half of the year or can you big picture just quantify that for us are we – or is this a good rate for the foreseeable future douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer look i mean the first quarter seasonally is always the low margin i mean for the year the margin is going to be greater than what energy showed in the first quarter john quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay and the bigger picture issues were in a better oil environment so we dont really need to revise longerterm assumptions downward i guess is my broader question there douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer no i – look i mean were going through a worldclass correction in the oil market and if you compare it to the last four corrections which typically were more of a  months to  months and this is certainly going to be – exceed  months in our forecast this is a more severe correction but no coming out of this we – look the demand for oil has not really been the question whats happened is weve been in an oversupply situation which has crushed price and now will crush activity which will lead to under supply and i mean thats what we believe is going to happen and youre going to see prices move up activity increase and the demand for our services increase as well right now everybody is focusing on the easiest oil they can find and to meet future demand theyre going to have to start reverting and getting back after the harder oil which is what ultimately drives higher demand in our portfolio we believe that story is intact john quealy  canaccord genuity inc okay thank you and very quickly as a followup under the healthcare business just holding its own is this going to be a type of year where were just looking for sort of sideways healthcare or are we going to hit an inflection point at some point on the acquired divestiture adjusted change thank you guys michael j monahan  senior vice president external relations yeah healthcare i think is going to strengthen throughout the year they had a very very good new business quarter in the first quarter second best that they have and measured so we feel good about whats going on they are now – the recall that really started last year in the third quarter is fully behind them and while that wasnt a huge top line hit it was a huge hit in terms of focus and energy of the group and now thats fully done fully resolved and moving forward i expect good things out of healthcare this year theyll continue to improve its not going to be a dramatic inflection in one quarter but i think youll see sequential improvement operator our next question is from manav patnaik with barclays bank please proceed with your question manav patnaik  barclays capital inc yeah hi thank you good afternoon gentlemen just to i guess make sure were all on the same page on the energy side can you just remind us of the mix in your energy business again between downstream production and so forth at the beginning of the year and then whats baked into each of those categories in terms of assumptions to get you to your lower end of uppersingle digit decline for this year douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well the wellchem is about  heading to  the production or ofc business is about  and downstream is  and downstream is growing wellchem is going to be under pressure again this year its likely going to bake towards the second half because its starting to run into where they were down  in the third and fourth quarter as you go forward the ofc business will be under some pressure but the drama isnt anywhere near what you see in wellchem manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and i guess douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer last year we were down  in total and we said this year that we would expect to be not to have as much top line pressure but it may get to  what ive indicated is were at the lower end of our expectations so highsingle digit sales declines this year like last year maybe a little less but in line with that manav patnaik  barclays capital inc and i guess if you were to try and characterize the main differential between when you gave the guidance in late february versus today like i guess which one area gets moved to get you to that lower end and maybe more douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i would say wellchem is going to be a little worse than we thought and ofc is going to be a little worse than we thought downstream is going to be in line with what we thought manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful and i was hoping you could elaborate a little bit i think you mentioned in your comments the new business bets like life sciences i was wondering if you were – if you could elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe if theres any other new businesses like this that youre referring to douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer well ill elaborate on life sciences life sciences is a business that we competed in for a long time but we did it as part of the work in our fb business and some of the function was driven out of our healthcare business weve taken those two pieces of business and created a focused division on the life sciences market ie pharma cosmetics etc the changes in that business and their needs match very much what we can do so its a market thats dominated by large multinationals theyre getting to shorter runs need to run at higher efficiencies cleaning in place technologies is important in that market and the core competencies that we have so a lot of the things that we do there match well i would say when this business is run as a small piece of two other businesses it performed well we believe with focused enhanced capabilities rd etc that we are going to be able to up the performance of this business handily just as weve done in other markets like food retail etc in the past operator our next question comes from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel please proceed with your question shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi thank you very much hey doug you had a very strong free cash flow quarter in the beginning of the year was there anything unusual or any pull forwards over there douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer one i mean the first quarter historically is our low first – lowest cash flow quarter last year was more the anomaly and we talked about it that working capital – some anomalies in working capital last year really hid the underlying performance and we said that you would expect to see improvements starting second third and fourth quarter in  and you did and so this year were going against a last year what i would call unusual negative cash flow performance this year is a little stronger than maybe normal but its really driven by excellent working capital we put real focus on it after last years frankly unacceptable first quarter and i think youre just seeing that discipline and focus carry through part of it is a conversation i had around energy where i think that team in a very difficult environment has done a heck of a job on receivables in particular which we needed to because otherwise youre going to walk right into a problem so thats really whats going on so strong underlying earnings the business is performing well it gets masked principally by fx and energy is going to go through ups and downs im not going to walk away from the downs but last year get out of fx were up  and i think if you look at our cash flow youll see the underlying strength and thats more indicative of what the business is doing even with energy shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc great and just as a followup can you give us an update on swisher i know its not huge but is the revenue coming in kind of the way that you expected youre expecting some kind of erosion and how long do you think it will take to get the margins more in line with the historical ecolab margins douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think the swisher acquisition is going as expected and remember our expectations are quite high in terms of ultimate return we did expect to see sales erosion we are seeing it its in line with expectations importantly the most critical and strategic part of their business were doing a great job securing its not all done were continuing to work on that in terms of getting after cost structure the team has made a lot of progress and if anything i think we will end up ahead of plan as we move forward it hasnt shown up yet really in the pl that would be probably more in the second half but in the whole scheme of things its not monstrously materially material but itll show up in the institutional results but really not until the second half right now its a drag but itll turn into a positive but not until the second half probably shlomo rosenbaum  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you operator our next question is from david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thanks hey doug back to energy just the cadence of earnings of q through q i know you discussed margins but whats the actual operating profit cadence do you expect for the rest of the year douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i need dollars guys just give us a second david sorry i wanted to get – we had a bunch of percentages its probably a little easier to give you absolute direction so we would expect second quarter profit is going to be greater than first quarter still under pressure but not nearly as much pressure as we were in terms of percentage in the first quarter almost half as much pressure on the percent we are going to start seeing we think profits flatten out in the second half and the question as they flatten in the third its probably more a fourth quarter scenario that well start seeing yearonyear flattening on profits as you start running against the base and you start having some sales stabilization and volume stabilization in the new business that we continue to put on start showing up so thats the expectation so i would say pressure in the first three quarters for sure its just going to be pressure that continues to become less severe as the year goes on part because of base part because well start seeing some new business but mostly base david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc got it and just on the overall gross margin nice expansion in q you expect expansion in q would you expect expansion in the back half of the year as well or would that be more flattish given the direction of raw materials douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer we would expect probably not the same level as gross profit expansion in the back half as the first but we will continue to see improvement throughout the year david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thank you very much operator our next question is from andy wittmann with robert w baird please proceed with your question andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc broker great thanks for taking this i guess maybe a little bit of color doug on whats driving the sequential improvement and i guess implicit margin performance i mean they were down pretty significantly in this quarter is that just easier comps or recovering pricing raw materials just to understand some of the drivers i think would be helpful douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer first of all the story is not that different but the margin commentary i just had on gross profit was whole company so andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah im talking energy douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah okay so if you want to get into that thats what i thought so energy you got seasonal volume where first quarter is our lowest volume on in whatever environment you want to go in the energy business and so in a flat environment without any share gain youre going to see a stepup in second and then a minor stepup again in the third and fourth quarter just from seasonality you have a market which isnt been stable but we think stabilizes later in the year not improves as you go through and so we think that seasonality comes through and then the other issue is share and we continue to gain share and our net ahead as we go through this and while its a tough environment we continue to see the few things that are happening in the world are coming our way and we are getting some of the existing fields to move our way and so its a combination of those two things that we think leads to a minor improvement when you start looking at yearonyear and you got to remember last year the second half we really had a lot of the market decline in the second half not all of it but a lot of it a lot more than the first half andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah okay that makes sense and then just in terms of the other businesses it looks like healthcare maybe energy and lets add paper these things all have either sequential improvement or looking for growth in the back half of the year are there any markets where you are seeing any other signs of weakness creeping in that we need to be watching out for that maybe dont have better growth prospects as we move into the year douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think the markets besides energy where were under the most pressure would be mining and heavy industry steel etc around the world i would say mining is probably getting down towards the bottom right it was fairly negative in the fourth and much more negative in the first were forecasting kind of flattening and then improvement in mining as we go forward as we start running into the base but its not that big of a business and the heavy industry stuff will start running into the base as well so i dont think there – this is like the puts and takes we have all the time so i dont know that it demands increased scrutiny from you trust me its getting plenty from us andrew john wittmann  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thank you operator our next question is from dmitry silversteyn with longbow research please proceed with your question dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc good afternoon a lot of them have been answered already but i just want to follow up on the specialty or the kay part of the institutional business weve seen growth there sort of slow down to midsingle digit levels this business used to perform at highsingle digit lowdouble digit growth is it just its kind of getting to the scale where its more difficult to grow at the rates you used to grow or is it market is still a little bit weaker can you talk a little bit about just what the expectation out of the business should be going forward douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think that business is going to continue to perform look it will have its doubledigit quarters but mostly its going to be growing in the highsingle digits and what really drives it as ive always described that business sort of feeds a village via elephants and so its a market thats dominated by large players and when you sell one you have a big fairly significant rampup you annualize against it and you continue to see rampup so its a little different cadence than many of our other businesses but that business is i think in great shape and doing the right things the opportunities in that business are fairly significant because there is real pain in the industry particularly in north america as a consequence of wage pressure and aca requirements and so increasingly customers are going to look to take labor out whatever the economists want to say theyre going to take labor out and thats a great opportunity for our qsr business in particular dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc sounds good then if you look at you mentioned along with new business wins some cost efficiencies have helped you with profitability is this part of a specific restructuring program that you have is it an ongoing sort of control of discretionary expenses in a difficult time can you talk about these cost efficiencies and how much of a runway i guess you have left douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well as ive described i think we have a lot of runway left on continuing to improve our efficiency as an organization as ive tried to state before the word synergy has a halflife and after a point in time you dont get to talk about cost savings and synergies any more but theres no way you put together two companies the size we did in  countries and have all your synergies worked out in  months without taking monster risk and we dont like to take stupid risks and so there is a lot still to be mined from the combination of nalco and champion as we go forward as there always is in a company even without that just getting better new technology drives new opportunities so yeah were quite confident i mean if you look at our track record before we did the nalco merger we had routine margin expansion for a number of years and we would expect youre going to see regular margin expansion going forward even if we call it cost savings instead of synergy dmitry silversteyn  longbow research llc got it okay thanks doug thats helpful operator our next question is from john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts  ubs securities llc thank you if i wanted to look at the sequential earnings change in global energy do you have the restated fourth quarter earnings that would compare so im looking at your current earnings the first quarter  the  million thats about  million lower than what you originally reported a year ago so with the rebasing and the venezuelan deconsolidation whats the fourth quarter that we would use for a sequential comparison douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer what is it  million we would say  million on both and so if you look at q and q i mean we do this as a matter of routine to look both yearonyear and sequentially the biggest driver in terms of this is volume some of thats seasonal and some of it is market but that would account for the vast majority simply you dont have the same coverage in your plants and everything else which is why first quarter broadly is always a lowmargin quarter for us and its a lowmargin quarter for energy as well and then it was exacerbated by further market declines as you go in i would also point out fourth quarter as weve said during the fourth quarter had a number of onetime positive events in it all of them legitimate but that would probably be accounted for almost  million of the  million that just werent going to recur which we called out in that fourth quarter and it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there at one time which were smart moves economically for the company were legitimate deals but you dont get to sell that inventory over and over again so it took risk off the table and triggered a sale and some gross profit realization as a consequence of that so those things are also part of the story and then we also had a onetimer negative in the first quarter in angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for when you take those things the whole thing makes sense but the fourth quarter was a little bit overstated and the first quarter is probably – is really reflective of low seasonality and we will see improved margin in energy going forward simply because volume will be greater in the outquarters than it was in this quarter and youll have better overhead coverage john roberts  ubs securities llc and then the other segment which has the  sales margins this quarter youre getting almost up to the institutional area now in terms of margins and we dont have a lot of good history of that segment given it usually was good margins on pest offset by investment in gcs but as gcs ramps its margins now how high does that other segment get do you think douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer well look gcs makes money now so we actually have a margin on the positive there and theyve done a good job driving that i think pest has always been a good profit business our pest business as youve seen has reaccelerated if you recall a couple years ago we said wed put it in a shop and are reinvesting in pest in a number of areas which weve done and to the teams credit theyve taken that reinvestment and delivered on the top line performance that they committed to so that grew nearly double digits in the first quarter which is what we had historically expected out of pest but then didnt see for quite a while gcs i mean out of that thing i think you can see regularly high teens may be approaching our goal as a corporation is  so im not going to really be happy until everybody is there john roberts  ubs securities llc okay thank you operator our next question is from mike harrison with seaport global please proceed with your question michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc hi good afternoon douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer hi mike michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc can you hear me okay douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc i was wondering doug if you could talk about the new synergex sanitizer product for cleaninplace applications thats kind of your workhorse in the fb market can you talk about some of the risks and the opportunities as youre introducing the nextgeneration product in that market douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah look i guess theres always risk if you introduce anything but theres greater risk if you introduce nothing so this is one of our core platforms its the heart of cip and so while well talk about what sales are for specific product it sort of understates its overall importance and so this is the next platform of antimicrobial as we move forward and we need to continue to bring broadbased kill the absence of bioaccumulation all the things that we think are very important to have going forward and this is the stateoftheart antimicrobial we believe in that marketplace and is very important to us continuing to drive our advantage in that market so weve got the best antimicrobial suite it just got better with this introduction michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc right and then i was curious also you mentioned that you were going to be – or you were splitting the europe business from the mea business was wondering if you could comment on the margin profile of those two businesses as separated and how they have trended over the past few years particularly with all the work that youve done in the europe region douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer weve reported regularly that we continue to improve europe and what weve given you historically is kind of apples and apples to our renaissance program europe is now highsingle digit margin business in total and mea is virtually double that so mea is a strong region in terms of oi margin if anything weve reduced it in the near term as we up investments in ga weve split this out two years ago weve added a number of key division leadership position added corporate account positions added supply chain positions so we have better ability to get product to customers in that region done a number of things which have put us in a better stead to drive growth which is a real focus in that place and well drive margin after we get growth really cooking but really right now its growth first michael joseph harrison  seaport global securities llc thanks very much operator our next question is from hamzah mazari with sterne agee please proceed with your question hamzah mazari  crt capital group llc good afternoon just a question on ma and balance sheet maybe given the current leverage a little over two times how are you thinking about appetite to do a larger deal and would it be fair to say that youre looking outside energy versus continuing to build energy thank you douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think in terms of our capability to do an outside deal we dont think is governed by our balance sheet at this point in time so we said our goal is to get down to roughly a  times ebitda margin and thats where we are we think thats the right balance between financial efficiency and also strategic capability ie capitalize or jump quickly if you needed to in terms of what were looking at i think our focus has been water because we believe its a great opportunity we continue to look there youve seen recent institutional and fb deals if they continue to have promising boltons well continue to do that and then i think healthcare broadly is an area that were still very interested in we think thats a great market for us and we aim to win in that market and i would say typically what weve set our minds to we do it sometimes takes us longer than we would like you certainly saw that in gcs but we get there and we ended up persevering and we are going to have a great healthcare business so those are areas were looking at in terms of energy weve said we dont want to be dramatically bigger than we are in energy weve said that for a while but with that where there are promising properties or new technologies that we think we can develop into promising annuity streams well do it we just announced one late last year a canadian technology that we bought for that very reason because the energy team i think has a very good vision of how to drive that technology into an annuity stream that helps customers and helps us so thats how we look at it right now the market there are deals going down for prices that honestly we wouldnt pay and were going to remain disciplined we did before we did the nalco deal after the froth was over and let me try to be smart stewards of shareholder money as we go forward hamzah mazari  crt capital group llc great thank you very much operator our next question is from rosemarie morbelli with gabelli  company please proceed with your question rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company thank you good afternoon everyone so you just answered my ma question so moving to pest and equipment is the  top line growth something that you are looking at going forward and will eventually – and if you could give us a feel for the timing will we see that kind of a growth rate on healthcare douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well i would say we expect – i would say its probably better to count on uppersingle digits in our other segment we do think thats quite real quite sustainable theyll pop into doubledigit land on some occasional quarters and theyll be a little lower on some quarters just because of what happens at times but yeah we think the pest and even the equipment care business have a long road at highsingle digit type growth and may be typically popping even over our  to  kind of target healthcare ultimately i think is the same type of business i think it – our aim is to get that business probably combine with life sciences to be uppersingle digit business on an organic basis obviously we may have additional ma activity in that business and that would push it above that for periods of time rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company do you need the ma doug in order to get to that  to  growth target or can you do it on your own the way the business is right now douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i dont – no we dont believe were missing something fundamental preventing us from doing it and i think when you look at a lot of the underneath economics that business is getting better and i think that team is on it and starting to get traction on the areas they need to get on and after kind of the place where we have a unique difference can own and protect and build and that business is growing very handily and becoming a larger piece of that portfolio which is what has to happen for you to see the big numbers out of that business so no we dont need anything but that doesnt mean if theres an attractive property or technology we would be open to it just as we are in the other businesses rosemarie jeanne morbelli  gabelli  company okay thank you operator our next question is from chris evans with goldman sachs please proceed with your question christopher evans  goldman sachs  co yeah thanks for taking my question doug a quick question on energy does the shift to these easier oil plays that you cited earlier does that challenge your return to your prior energy earnings levels douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer well the shift is somewhat temporary and mostly notable in saving the shale play and everything else and if anything its a gain that runs out so in this very tough economic environment what folks have done is basically gone to focus on the wells that are easiest to extract and cheapest to extract thats how theyre keeping cash flow going to pay their bills and hopefully survive until the price recovers and when price recovers and demand needs to be met because youve got a lot of capital thats been pulled out of that business theyre going to have to go back to the other wells and so the shift is inevitable you cant meet the demand for oil next year with just easy oil so i mean this will happen and so then you will see the natural cadence occur in this business again christopher evans  goldman sachs  co thanks appreciate the answer and then staying with energy just for another one could you just bridge me the  sales decline to the  ebit in terms of maybe volume price douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer well i mean i dont have like the bridge in front of me its look in that and almost any business when you have significant deleveraging in a business you have almost this immediate significant impact on oi because theres no time to take out overhead and i wouldnt anyway because a lot of this is just seasonally so you get underabsorption in the plants that just immediately instead of going into inventory hits your oi line i mean this is just basic pl stuff but  is a significant volume hit weve been under pressure there we did not build inventory were trying to be disciplined on inventory and the other stuff so we took it on the chin last year if you recall we were building inventory yearonyear in energy because it took us a while to turn off the spigot in reaction to the market so youve got even probably more outsized yearonyear impact from absorption than you would under normal times christopher evans  goldman sachs  co got you so this was just the volumes no impact from any pricing decline douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah but in line with what i talked and not materially different from the other quarters christopher evans  goldman sachs  co okay thank you operator our next question is from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed with your question christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc broker perfect thank you can you just comment on your recent new business launches within the water segment in terms of recent growth contribution and also any color on the cadence of the potential ramps for the new platforms which you mentioned for the second half of the year douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer im sorry can you repeat the second half of the question christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc broker just any color on the cadence of the potential ramps of the new platforms which youve mentioned in your release for the second half of the year douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so in the water business i mean we have continued expansion drive of our d trasar units which continues to go well and move weve also launched solids weve talked about for the light side of the business let me just turn on to my page where weve got – so our expected revenue on new launches for water are going to be around  million to  million this year they will build throughout the year typically the way i would think about a launch when we launch a program it typically takes five years for us to reach peak annual sales so its not this monster rampup the technology also has legs and we will often be selling technology for at least  years before we replace a platform or do other things and this certainly is obviously longerlived technology than apple probably talks about so in terms of expected sales from our cooling water product line around d trasar well end up at  million ultimately this year but our fiveyear expected sales out in   would be around  million christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc broker perfect thats helpful and just very quickly on the food and beverage side youve mentioned penetrating your existing customers fairly well across your portfolio one of the things you just actually just discussed but youve also had some new business wins despite a tough environment can you just really quickly parse out what you believe are the ecolabspecific trends here versus what youre seeing in the actual end market and how youre comping versus that thank you douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well i mean i believe our fb business was up  in first quarter and certainly i dont think the food market this is the heavily processed food dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets it includes protein and other areas but those businesses are under pressure and so theres no doubt in my mind were outperforming the market and the pressure comes in twofold one there are the consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food and second theres been quite a bit of ma activity in that market which means ultimately they consolidate and take out manufacturing facilities which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us long term though the drivers in fb i think are in excellent shape its called population and food safety and the population will grow around the world the middle class will grow expectation for food quality will continue to increase particularly in emerging markets and food safety is only going to get more challenging thats why theres a lot of conversation in the us about local farming local farming is not going to feed  billion people and its also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm what youre going to want to do is farm where stuff naturally grows so youre not going to see bananas growing in manhattan anytime soon it doesnt make any sense it would be local but it wouldnt be very sustainable and so ultimately i think youre going to still see longdistance shipping of food to in particular feed the asian population growth and long distance equals time and time is the enemy of food safety and so if anything we think the demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand which is ultimately going to be driven by the two components i talked about population growth and middleclass expectation growth so i like our food and beverage business new technology teams on it were outperforming the market i think that business gets better and the water technology coupling we have is spot on for that business and its a huge way to leverage our installed base in fb operator our next question comes from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer please proceed with your question scott schneeberger  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks doug just to get a better feel for the industrial segment im curious a nice couple hundred basis points fixed currency margin expansion yearoveryear you said volume gains pricing cost savings and lower product costs i was just wondering are those in order of magnitude and how it spreads across the sub segments of the business and then lastly what we should look for as we move through the year as what the bigger drivers are in the industrial segment thanks so much douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its like an ingredient list its in order of magnitude and so what weve said is the one area raw material benefits are expected to decline as the year moves on and possibly even move into slightly negative territory by yearend but the balance of it volume pricing cost savings are going to be tools that will remain in our quiver that we will use scott schneeberger  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks and just across the sub segments which may be the biggest drivers in industrial douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer you mean which areas of those are going to be utilized i dont – say it again scott schneeberger  oppenheimer  co inc broker just of the subcategories in your industrial segment which do you feel will drive the business overall through the balance of the year which of those douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think fb and core water i mean core water is up  it was mining that was down and that business continues to strengthen thats even with the pressure in steel and other areas and so chinas tough but theres always something going on in the world but water we think continues to strengthen theyve got good innovation theyre on the new business fb is in solid shape i mean those are the large businesses in industrial textile improved had a pretty strong first quarter and we would expect to have a strong year as we go forward so its pretty good i think across the segment were in pretty good shape scott schneeberger  oppenheimer  co inc broker great thanks operator our next question is from dan dolev with nomura asset management please proceed with your question dan dolev  nomura securities international inc hi thanks for taking my question just want to make clear that i understand so in late february you spelled out  to  constant currency eps growth what is the constant currency eps growth as of today for the year what is the expectation in constant currency terms douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i would say at this point in time we havent really as i said reflected a change in currency and we havent changed our range so it wouldnt have changed dan dolev  nomura securities international inc got it so the math that i went through to get you to  to  youre saying thats not the right math at this point douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer well heres the thing i guess what weve said is if we snapped a line right now and froze all rates at the rate you see today and that was the end rate for the year youre going to have  less currency headwind than we forecast in late february but given all the stuff going on in the world we dont think booking that at this point in time is wise theres a lot of things that can change including currency as the year goes on and theres just too much time remaining in the year in a very dynamic environment to go snap the line on one of multiple variables so what weve basically said is we have not changed our expected currency outcome for the year even though we recognize and admit that todays rates would indicate its  better so yeah if you want to go do that math but theres a lot of things going in here we havent increased our range either at this point in time and i think as the year goes well continue to try to be transparent in what our expectations are and what the underlying assumptions leading to our forecasted range and from there right were going to just watch multivariable inputs and see how it all turns out but i would expect to deliver on our range dan dolev  nomura securities international inc got it just one followup and more longterm reflective the analysis that we did for our initiation work two years ago we looked at your margin growth for the last few years including and excluding the synergies including – excluding all the synergies that you got from nalco and champion which were a lot you were probably getting  basis points to  basis points of margin growth per our math in q you got about  basis points i assume there was some energy impact do you still stand behind that  margin and how are you going to get there by  douglas m baker jr  chairman  chief executive officer i think when we launched the  margin we did that at an investor conference it was  million in sales  margin – oi margin and  return on invested capital i was very clear at that time that we werent going to hit all three by  because if you did the math it would imply much more than  eps growth and what we said is we believe all three are achievable theyre achievable within sight of  but they werent all going to occur by  and thats still true if you go to just the last two years if  expected fx hit not a dime better youve got  and  wed lose  billion in sales in two years just from currency translation and over  million in oi i mean thats what those rates mean so they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have from one of those deals with that we continue to deliver positive eps growth as we go through it i will also say we also believe that translation fx not transaction transaction fx we never talk about its almost equal in size but we think thats a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because its the equivalent of inflation basically so we dont talk about it we only talk about translation because translation is sort of goofy if i was headquartered in munich last year i would have been up  eps with everything happening exactly the same except im consolidating into euro not into dollars our business isnt any better our share is not any better our margins arent any better nothings better except i translate into a more favorable currency and so this stuff flips back and forth so our margin improvement yeah i think is real at fixed currency it was more like  not  and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in year out and one year its going to look like  because currency is going to go in our favor and i will tell you its still only  because really you got to look at this the way the margins really coming country by country and currency by currency thats the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to a corporation right so thats how we look at it operator
