the extraordinary growth of mutual funds over the last three decades agreed yesterday to pay  million and be banned from the financial industry for life to settle an investigation over rapid trades he made at the expense of investors in his fundsmr strong the founder of strong capital management is the most prominent figure to be ensnared in a sweeping investigation of improper trading in mutual funds begun last september by eliot spitzer the new york attorney general mr spitzer and other regulators have sued some of the largest money managers forcing several to pay steep penalties and also reduce the fees charged to investorsstrong capital based in menomonee falls wis agreed to pay  million and cut management fees for its mutual funds by  percent over the next five yearsmr spitzer has long maintained that mr strongs behavior stood out because he personally profited from the trading and also because as chief executive he should have known better advertisement continue reading the main story the magnitude of his breach of duty is greater than what we have seen in other cases mr spitzer said yesterday when youre the ceo your duty could not be more clear continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the amount mr strong is paying is the largest penalty by an individual since the mutual fund investigation began the sum is large measured against other recent corporate misconduct like the amounts demanded by regulators in cases against the wall street analysts jack b grubman and henry blodget of course criminal cases involving wall street figures have resulted in much larger fines still mr spitzer noted that mr strongs penalty is significant in proportion to his trading profitsthe punishments of mr strong  and his company are part of settlements negotiated jointly with mr spitzer the securities and exchange commission the wisconsin attorney general and the wisconsin department of financial institutions the amounts to be paid by the company and mr strong will go to investors harmed by the improper tradingstrong capital management and its founder richard strong betrayed the mutual fund investors they were dutybound to protect stephen m cutler director of enforcement at the sec said in a statement yesterdaymr strong wrote a statement of contrition that was released by mr spitzers office yesterdaythroughout my career i have considered it to be my sacred duty to protect my investors and yet in a particular and persistent way i let them down mr strong wrote i frequently traded the shares of the strong funds at the same time that the advice which we gave our investors was to do the opposite and to hold their shares for the long termthe settlement is a humbling of a pioneer in the mutual fund business mr strong rose to prominence from modest roots in north dakota described by colleagues as having an abrasive and tenacious personality he built strong over three decades into an industry giant through aggressive marketing and recruitment of investment talenttoday the company manages  billion in assets in mutual funds and investments for institutions including pension fundsforbes magazine has estimated mr strongs personal wealth at  million but it was a relatively small gain that resulted in his downfall advertisement continue reading the main story he made  million in profit on hundreds of shortterm trades in strong capital mutual funds even as the companys public filings indicated that it discouraged such activity mr spitzers office said yesterdaythe company also permitted a hedge fund canary capital partners to trade rapidly in and out of strongs funds regulators said the trades by canary and its manager edward stern were first disclosed by mr spitzer in a  million settlement with the fund and mr stern last septembermr spitzer had weighed bringing criminal charges against mr strong for the trading and had convened a grand jury to consider the case mr strong who avoided criminal charges agreed to pay  million in penalties and disgorgement of profitsmr strong will be banned from associating with any investment or brokerage firm regulators said the settlement does not preclude his receiving any profits from the sale of strong capital where he controls an  percent stake mr spitzer said mr strong resigned in december as company chairman newsletter sign up continue reading the

wells fargo the big san franciscobased bank is the leading candidate to acquire the company people briefed on the talks have said wells was waiting for the regulators investigation to be resolved before it would consider an agreement to buy the company these people saida spokesman for the bank declined to comment yesterdaya sale would come after mr strong hurt the business he worked so long to develop assets at the company declined to  billion under management at the end of april from  billion at the end of september weeks before mr strongs trading became publicmr strong will probably get much less for his interest in the company than he sought when he put it up for sale mr strong had hoped for close to  billion people briefed on the sale negotiations said now he is likely to get half that amountone fund industry analyst said he was surprised that mr spitzer had not pursued a criminal case against mr strongmr spitzer had been holding up strong as a poster child for going to jail said roy weitz who runs a web site called fundalarmcom theres some suggestion that the steam is running out of this investigation with regulators eager to settle and move on he said advertisement continue reading the main story mr spitzer acknowledged that some critics would say that he should have brought charges against mr strong but he said that he did not bring a criminal case against mr strong because market timing was not clearly illegalin the fund investigation to date mr spitzer said the criminal cases weve made all relate to late trading he said which refers to trades made after the market has closed but at an earlier price such trading is clearly illegal he said but the legality of market timing is more ambiguousmr spitzer said he had insisted on a statement of contrition by mr strong rather than a refusal to admit or deny charges a feature of prior settlements that statement could figure in future securities litigation against mr strong mr weitz saidmr strongs lawyer stanley s arkin made clear that mr strong was aware of the impact of his behavior on the company he foundedin reaching this civil settlement dick had very much in mind that he wished to preserve the jobs and the futures of the many loyal and talented people at strong capital and at the same time enable the funds to continue for the future benefit of all of their shareholders mr arkin said mr strong was not available for comment mr arkin saidkenneth j wessels who was named chairman and chief executive of strong last december said yesterday these settlement agreements allow us to move forward and concentrate all of our energies on meeting the needs of our clientstwo other employees of the company were named in yesterdays settlement thomas a hooker jr who had been director of compliance at strong capital and anthony j damato an executive vice president have also agreed to a ban from the industrymr damato will pay  in penalties and disgorgement mr hooker will pay a  civil penaltya spokeswoman for strong capital said the two men were no longer at the companythe case reflects the increased attention compliance officers are receiving in a new era of enforcement of the securities laws said richard morvillo a lawyer for mr hooker advertisement continue reading the main story a lawyer for mr damato did not return calls continue reading the main story we’re interested

pay  million to settle fraud charges concerning undisclosed mutual fund trading for immediate releaserichard strong and two executives permanently barred from mutual fund industrywashington dc may    the securities and exchange commission announced today a settled enforcement action against strong capital management inc scm its founder and majority owner richard s strong two affiliated entities and two other scm executives for allowing and in the case of strong engaging in undisclosed frequent trading in strong mutual funds in violation of their fiduciary duties to the strong funds and their investors the settled order requires the payment of more that  million in monetary remedies and imposes regulated industry bars and other reliefstephen m cutler director of the secs division of enforcement said strong capital management and its founder richard strong betrayed the mutual fund investors they were dutybound to protect in richard strongs case his personal trades were a betrayal of the highest order warranting the stiffest possible civil sanctionsrobert j burson senior associate regional director of the secs midwest regional office added this is the second time that strong and scm have been the subject of an sec enforcement action for placing their interests before the interests of mutual fund investors that fact together with the gravity of the breach of trust reflected in the commissions findings shows that the severe sanctions imposed in this case are warrantedthe commissions order finds among other thingsscm entered into an express agreement with hedge fund manager edward stern allowing his hedge funds the canary hedge funds to market time certain strong funds in order to obtain nonmutual fund business from stern and his family the agreement enabled the canary hedge funds to make approximately  round trip trades in four strong funds realizing gross profits of  million from december  to may  under scms policies and procedures other shareholders would have been ejected from the strong funds for engaging in similar trading richard strong engaged in frequent trading in several strong funds including one fund he managed between  and  he engaged in several hundred such trades making gross profits of  million and net profits of  million scm failed to disclose the arrangement with stern and strong and scm failed to disclose strongs personal trading to the strong funds boards of directors or shareholders in fact the strong funds prospectuses and scms policies and practices created the misleading impression that frequent trading of the kind practiced by strong and the canary hedge funds would not be allowed scm provided the canary hedge funds with the monthend portfolio holdings for the funds in which canary traded before other shareholders could see the same information to the possible detriment of the funds and their shareholders scms affiliated transfer agent strong investor services inc sis and its affiliated brokerdealer strong investments inc sii facilitated scms violations by allowing the canary hedge funds frequent trading anthony j damato scms executive vice president and a resident of elm grove wis aided and abetted scms violations by approving the arrangement with the canary hedge funds thomas a hooker scms compliance officer aided and abetted scms and strongs violations by failing after he learned of strongs frequent trading to follow up on a directive to monitor the trading and ensure it stoppedbased on these findings the commission ordered  scm to pay  million in disgorgement and  million in civil penalties  strong to pay  million in disgorgement and  million in civil penalties  damato to pay  in disgorgement and  in civil penalties and  hooker to pay a  civil penaltyin addition the commission  barred strong from association with any investment adviser investment company broker dealer municipal securities dealer or transfer agent  barred damato from association with any investment adviser investment company broker or dealer and  barred hooker from association with any investment adviser or investment company scm sii and sis consented to censures and undertook compliance and mutual fund governance reforms all parties consented to ceaseanddesist ordersthe commissions order finds that scm and strong violated sections  and  of the investment advisers act scm violated section a of the advisers act and section b of the investment company act damato and scm violated section a of the advisers act and section b of the investment company act damato sii and sis aided and abetted violations of sections  and  of the advisers act and hooker aided and abetted violations of sections  of the advisers act scm strong sii sis damato and hooker consented to entry of the commissions order without admitting or denying the findingsthis enforcement action has been coordinated with the office of the new york attorney general and the wisconsin department of financial
