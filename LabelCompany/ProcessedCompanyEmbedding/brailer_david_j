health reco what can the aan do to encourage members to adopt david j brailer md phd was appointed the first national health information technology coordinator in  to implement an executive order of president george w bush to facilitate widespread use of health information technology within  years to improve patient safety and efficiency dr brailer who earned his medical degree at west virginia university and his phd in managerial economics at the wharton school is an expert in health information technology and health systems management prior to his appointment dr brailer was a senior fellow at the health technology center in san francisco a nonprofit research and education organization that provides strategic information and resources to health care organizations about the future impact of technology in health care delivery he also served for ten years as chairman and ceo of carescience inc a leading provider of care management services and internetbased solutions that help reduce medical errors and improve physician and hospitalbased performance dr brailer delivers the public policy lecture today at the presidential plenary session today at  am at exhibit hall d in an interview with the neurology today meeting dispatch he highlights the governments strategies for supporting electronic health records ehrs back to top  article outline what is our government doing to help physicians implement ehr the certification commission for health information technology hit a voluntary privatesector initiative to certify hit products is a few months away from completing its mission to accelerate the adoption of robust interoperable health information technology throughout the us healthcare system by creating an efficient credible sustainable mechanism for the certification of health information technology products certification will ensure that a product has certain types of clinical prompts and decision support privacy and security and standards and interfaces to share information every doctor needs to ask their vendor if it is certified and if not when it intends to be there are three ways we can help physicians we want to help develop lower cost technology improve the benefits or value of these systems and lower the risk of adopting these products back to top  article outline how can the ehr costs be lowered and the benefits improved figure dr david br the cost of support training integration etc is a fixed cost whether it is provided to five doctors or  unfortunately vendors cannot make this less expensive we need to find simpler technology for small physician offices most products are built for large practices which can absorb these costs new products need to come to the market that will be less difficult to implement and maintain and for smaller practices which typically lack it departments i anticipate that the time that this article comes out our proposed regulation allowing hospitals to donate ehrs to physicians should be accepted we are also pushing to see doctors get paid more for using ehrs through payforperformance initiatives back to top  article outline how can the risk of adopting these products be lowered certification will lower the risk of purchasing an ehr by allowing doctors to compare systems for example if two systems are both certified and one costs twice the amount of the other doctors may select the lower cost option with the knowledge that it has met the standards required for certification we see physicians as falling into three categories doctors who have already adopted ehrs – and dont want the government telling them that it is time to switch to a new product doctors who will never adopt technology – and should have the privilege of that option and those who fall in between the end game is an effort to build a nationwide information network that will support all products much like a cell phone would be useless without verizon or another telecommunications provider the ehr is useless if it is not connected to laboratories and pharmacies it should be plug and play then it has huge value with a capacity to share information our vision is not to see a doctor use a product on a standalone basis back to top  article outline are you on target for your fiveyear timeline yes the ehr agenda has struck a chord and gained huge momentum that is not to say that we do not have big challenges the centers for medicaid and medicare services has to modernize its practices for example but the world is changing quickly and doctors are adopting these tools on a widespread basis back to top  article outline what functionalities should physicians seek in their ehr products we recognize that each specialty has its own requirements either in terms of certain information that its physicians require or specific needs for documentation so we are asking each specialty society to provide additional criteria beyond what we establish for certification they should ask vendors whether they can meet those specific needs and get together with other specialties and compare notes back to top  article outline should physicians purchase electronic health records today or wait a while until the technology improves they should start now – unabashedly yes although it is true that the software technology for ehr will likely change over time and continue to evolve the concept that you can buy an ehr that you will use for the rest of your life is flawed ehr usage is a journey not a destination the things that matter that truly deliver value are not inherent in the software but rather in the reengineering and organization of a practice and the changes a physician makes in order to implement an ehr back to top  article outline what can the aan do to encourage members to adopt ehr the group that has done the most is the american academy of family physicians the pediatricians have also done a great job in changing daytoday practice through ehr the american academy of neurology needs to see how it can help its members make better clinical decisions share information and ask how the practice of neurology changes if doctors were to have access to realtime information  american academy of neurology article outline what is our government doing to help physicians i how can the ehr costs be lowered and the benefits how can the risk of adopting these products be lo are you on target for your fiveyear timeline what functionalities should physicians seek in th should physicians purchase electronic health reco what can the aan do to encourage

meaningful use criteria feel rightby patty enradojanuary   am share the hand of thoughtful policy created the proposed criteria for meaningful use according to david j brailer md former healthcare it czar for the office of the national coordinator it would have been easy to be symbolic rather than meaningful the founder and chairman of the san franciscobased healthcare investor firm health evolution partners said he expected the criteria to be looser less meaningful instead he said im pretty impressed in the short term the recently released criteria reflect the body of work and the broad consensus of the definition of standards from the private sector quality agencies and forums a product certification organization and the old ahic american health information community he said as health it chief brailers philosophy was having government be a supportive agent of the consensus of the work being done by the private sector find the proposed criteria for providers here and the proposed criteria for hospitals here the meaningful use criteria are highly consistent with what we did he said it feels right to me onc has matured wonderfully in terms of appropriate policy going forward using various tools as drivers for healthcare it adoption targeting hies with grants and testing ideas he said pointing out that under his tenure onc built test models of the nationwide health information network brailer had high praise for his successor david blumenthal md saying he is doing a fantastic job when he headed onc brailer said he benefited from blumenthals advice on health it adoption he has deep policy capabilities brailer said brailer said he hopes onc will remain a key player and doesnt get coopted by the federal health it efforts of the centers for medicare and medicaid its an open secret that onc and cms were at odds during his term he said he is also critical of congress rushing to put health it in the american recovery and reinvestment act arra it puts more risks on healthcare it adoption than are necessary he said under arra congress provides incentives first and then penalties citing its track record with regard to medicare issues brailer doesnt believe congress will follow through with penalties and will either delay or phase them out the problem however is that the congressional budget office expects  billion in additional net bonuses over the next  years to come from the penalties it sets up expectations in the market it confuses the market he said we need to make sure that physicians and hospitals are in a stable nonerratic market while healthcare it adoption particularly getting physicians to use true clinical decision support will continue to be a challenge the outcome is obvious brailer said information technology will eventually carry into the industry ours was a battle of timing he said the question for government policy is how do we get there faster the challenge he said is determining how policymakers and industry leaders help create massive transformation with the least disruption for providers and patients expect to see more fragmentation in  brailer said well be approaching the peak of the hype cycle he said he presages a real slide back to reality with the money coming from cms flowing slower than everybody thinks the pushback to reality is predictable and required with any hype he said despite the challenges and problems ahead brailer said the problem isnt whether we are making progress we are   topics meaningful use health information exchange hie share view all comments  top story
