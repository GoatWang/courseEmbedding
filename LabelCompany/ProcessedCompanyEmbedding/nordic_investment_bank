other theme bonds have become a wellestablished asset for a growing number of investors in recent years like other supranational institutions the nordic investment bank issues environmental bonds pursuant to its mandate the bank is particularly well equipped to offer investments targeted at projects which contribute to environmental improvements nib has an explicit environmental mandate this means the bank strives to promote environmentfriendly projects in its financing last year nib financed projects expected to reduce co emissions by  tonnes and discharges of phosphorus into the baltic sea by  tonnes the latter is equivalent to discharges from a wastewater treatment plant covering an area of approximately  million inhabitants in  nib created a framework for the issuance of nib environmental bonds or nebs it provides that the proceeds from nebs be used for lending to solutions for renewable energy energy efficiency and public transport and for the reduction of emissions into the air or water since a substantial part of the bank’s lending is already classified as environmental loans one of the main tasks within the neb framework is to define how the projects to be financed by environmental bonds are selected the analysis of the environmental impact of each project financed by nib is an integral aspect of the loan approval process in the assessment of the environmental impact of a project the bank also looks at the implementation risk of the anticipated positive effects on the environment both aspects are taken into account when selecting projects to be financed under the neb programme how does the neb programme work rather strict rules have been set for loans to qualify for the programme only projects which receive a high score on environmental impact and a low score on implementation risk can qualify the duration of the loan and the maturity of the bond do not need to match exactly which gives the programme enough flexibility to respond to investors’ duration preferences without compromising the goal of only financing the best projects by nebs transparency is an important aspect of nib’s daily work the same applies to disclosing the use of the proceeds from issuing nebs the proceeds are held in a separate portfolio until they are disbursed to an eligible project a list of projects financed from the neb proceeds is available here the issues of the nib environmental bonds carry the same aaaaaa rating as any other debt issues made by the bank how do nib environmental bonds fit into the bank’s overall funding strategy while strict eligibility rules put a limit on the issuance volume nib is committed to the environmental bond market and aims to continue offering this product to the market “nebs offer a sustainable investment opportunity for investors and raise nib’s profile as an environmentally conscious bank in the capital markets” says alexander ruf senior funding manager at nib nib environmental bonds   apr  back to

successes nordic investment bank uses analytics to thrive in volatile financial markets webfocus bi platform gives international lender a competitive edge rapid changes are occurring in the financial services industry even as the expected time to market for new lending products and services has decreased banks and lenders need rigorous information management practices to survive and firstrate analytics technology to thrive they also need to comply with strict regulations governing credit ratings loan approval standards and liquidity requirements meeting these requirements has become increasingly difficult in the wake of new government regulations from basel iii guidelines to money market fund reform rules which happened after the global financial meltdown nordic investment bank nib has standardized on information builders webfocus business intelligence bi and analytics platform to meet these business challenges head on headquartered in helsinki finland nib is an international financial institution jointly owned by denmark finland iceland norway sweden estonia latvia and lithuania nib borrows funds on the international capital markets and offers longterm lending to private and public entities to complement commercial lending its bonds enjoy the highest possible credit rating we depend on information builders technology and local infobuild services to provide insights to lending finance accounting risk management treasury and other parts of the organization says aini joensuu chief systems officer at nib webfocus is essential for information management and compliance webfocus for interactive reporting joensuu and her team implemented a portal with dashboards for accounting treasury administration planning and risk management the portal lets authorized users access current information on demand users easily explore data via reports graphs and charts these analytics assets leverage many core webfocus features such as webfocus reportcaster to send information directly to people’s emails we depend on webfocus parameterization and active technologies across all our departments joensuu notes nearly everybody in the organization can access webfocus we have more than  users information builders calls interactive analytics applications infoapps™ since they allow people to visualize data in charts and graphs and easily drill into the data users can find and compare relevant data elements and then select an output format to save display or analyze the data including html excel and pdf webfocus puts our data in a very accessible form says jaana ijas a senior system specialist at nib who spearheads much of the webfocus development if users want to examine lending data in a particular sector they start with a portfolio at the summary level and drill down to the detail level as they examine the information addressing regulatory compliance all banks face tough lending standards and conservative guidelines for capital reserves as an international finance institution nib ensures that it complies with regulations nib also tracks its lending activity by business areas such as energy and environment infrastructure transportation and telecom industries and services and financial institutions and small and mediumsize enterprises smes officers in the treasury and risk departments use webfocus to analyze liquidity as they monitor the inflow and outflow of funds by sector time period portfolio and other variables an infoapp™ computes liquidity buffer survival horizons – projections of financial liquidity based on current and expected lending activity as our lending system establishes payment plans funding officers need to compare what actually comes in with what is expected to come in ijas explains what are the expected distributions against the expected amounts of these loans over a particular time period this same logic applies to treasury instruments webfocus lets treasury officers calculate risk patterns for inflows and outflows among any group of customers ensuring that nib maintains adequate survival horizons other webfocus reports enable the accounting department to reconcile balances and verify that transactions have been correctly posted from subledgers to the general ledger cash flow and compliance are dependent on the ability to access and analyze this information ijas adds datamigrator prepares the data webfocus acquires data from a microsoft sql server data warehouse which is periodically loaded with operational information from an sap enterprise resource planning erp system a customized lending system a treasury system and other operational databases including text files and csv files every day iway datamigrator also from information builders grabs relevant information from these source systems and loads it into the warehouse merging relational data with flatfile data and putting it all into a common format behind the scenes datamigrator handles all necessary conversions and transpositions to ensure consistent financial and operational reporting webfocus preaggregates the data into a reporting warehouse to ensure that users obtain results quickly users in each department and corporate domain are authorized to see only certain portions of the database based on their specific needs and the controls built into the security profile webfocus also accesses data directly from the source systems having a combination of realtime and staged data sources gives nib personnel flexibility to satisfy reporting and analytics needs reportcaster automatically generates standard reports and places them in the reporting library for auditing purposes reportcaster also sends reports to email addresses and printers and distributes files for other processes but mainly reports are run on demand we can access various kinds of data and combine it as we need it joensuu confirms webfocus has been a huge timesaver for example risk officers must submit information to oversight boards three times per year to verify liquidity recovery ratios previously they had to manually pull information from several different information systems and load it into excel tables to calculate these ratios which was cumbersome and timeconsuming now people use webfocus reports for this ensuring accuracy and saving many hours of work joensuu says they can see the data any time rather than merely at these periodic intervals webfocus not only makes it easy to get the data we need but also improves this business process evolving with the data emerging market trends shifting industry regulations and new competitive forces necessitate new types of reporting analysis and information management in response nib has developed a more robust enterprise data warehouse it plans to use datamigrator to load the warehouse and webfocus to add new types of reports dashboards and infoapps™ to the portal – as well as to explore information builders master data management mdm technology to automate data enrichment and data quality initiatives we work with infobuild on an ongoing basis and we are satisfied with their ability to implement information builders’ technology joensuu concludes their consultants have a good handle on our needs and information builders continues to supply advanced technology for our needs the organization an
