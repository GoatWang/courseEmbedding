doubleline picks up the pieces  briefly noted    by david snowball  herewith are notes about the  launch alert  riverpark commercial real estate fund rcrix by david snowball on monday october  riverpark funds launched riverpark commercial real estate fund rcrix like several of riverpark’s funds rcrix began life as a hedge fund unlike any of its predecessors though it is being structured as an interval fund what does that mean morty schaja explains the investment case the fund’s objective is to seek current income and capital appreciation consistent with the preservation of capital by investing predominantly in the approximately  billion commercial mortgage backed securities “cmbs” market that is secured by incomeproducing commercial real estate assets predominantly in the united states riverpark believes that the fund provides a unique opportunity to generate midsingle digit income yields based upon current coupons and purchase discounts with both limited credit and interest rate risk and with a proven and experienced manager with negligible interest rate sensitivity limited credit risk and singledigit returns the fund might be an alternative to those attracted to david sherman’s closed riverpark shortterm high yield fund rphyx the fund will begin life with  million in assets from its private predecessor of which 0 million is the manager’s own money the fund will be managed by edward l shugrue iii ceo of tallmadge llc the closedend interval structure is interesting it means that you can buy shares whenever you want but you can only redeem shares quarterly the manager will have the option of redeeming between  and  of the fund’s shares quarterly at nav and without any additional fees as a practical matter that allows the manager to sidestep the pressure of daytoday liquidity and the risk of needing to liquidate illiquid positions in the face of some transitory investor panic in theory that allows stronger longterm returns and a more rational portfolio the decision to adopt an interval fund structure is an implicit recognition of the exceptional risks posed by this asset class commercial real estate has experienced an extended boom valuations are high and the chair of the boston federal reserve has warned that banks may be pursuing the market too vigorously the rewards of the strategy may well substantially outweigh the risks but that shouldn’t be taken for granted proceed with care and vigilance investors purchasing directly from riverpark face a 0 minimum initial investment the fund’s opening expense ratio is  because of the predecessor fund’s long track record the riverpark folks have a pretty detailed factsheet in draft it will likely be available at the riverpark funds site at the official launch search mfo search for

real estate assets predominantly in the united states riverpark believes that the fund provides a unique opportunity to generate midsingle digit income yields based upon current coupons and purchase discounts with both limited credit and interest rate risk and with a proven and experienced manager riverpark believes the fund should be considered by investors looking to decrease their exposure to the risk of rising interest rates in their fixed income portfolios and investors seeking noncorrelated alternative investments that generate current income as has been the case since the predecessor funds inception in the current environment the fund expects to invest primarily in  single assetsingle borrower cmbs that are secured by institutional quality commercial real estate assets that we believe generally have better liquidity transparency and sponsorship    performing nondistressed assets supported by robust inplace cash flow    investments that are protected by subordinate layers of debt and equity with an average portfolio loantovalue ratio or ltv of less than  and with no single asset greater than 6 ltv  and    floatingrate instruments that reset monthly with short to medium

in addition to the normal risks associated with investing international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social economic or political instability in other nations investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility the riverpark longshort opportunity fund uses leverage if the securities decrease in value the fund may suffer a greater loss than would have resulted without the use of leverage with short sales losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the short strategy may impact the performance of the fund the value of the funds positions in index options fluctuates in response to changes in the value of the underlying index selling index call options can reduce the risk of owning stocks but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks in exchange for upfront cash at the time of selling the call option unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the funds option strategies and for these and other reasons the funds option strategies may not reduce the funds volatility to the extent desired accordingly the purchase of fund shares should be viewed as a longterm investment

diversified as that term is defined in the investment company act of 0 bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk default risk and interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise high yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities due to the speculative nature of their investments securities backed by
