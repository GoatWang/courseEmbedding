the increase in cash flow from financing activities in  reflected our need to fund the increased cash flow used in operating activities in  as compared to  as described above going concern our financial statements for the three and six month period ended april   have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business we not generated revenues have achieved losses since our inception and rely upon the sale of our common stock and proceeds from shareholder loans to fund our operations if we are unable to raise equity or secure alternative financing we may not be able to continue our operations and our business plan may fail if our operations and cash flow improve management believes that we can continue to operate however no assurance can be given that managements actions will result in profitable operations or an improvement in our liquidity situation the threat of our ability to continue as a going concern will cease to exist only when our revenues have reached a level able to sustain our business operations our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty  table of contents future financings if our company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore our company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in our company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may be available however if such financing were available because we have no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if our company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing we would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in our companys common stock would lose all of their investment as of the date of this report the current funds available to our company will not be sufficient to continue operations the cost to establish our company and begin operations is estimated to be approximately  over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be  over this same period not taking into account any additional funds that may be required for the acquisition or commencement of a stem cell banking business our officers and directors have undertaken to provide our company with operating capital to sustain our business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a nonsecured loan however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes that if our company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the securities and exchange commission sec we will have to cease all efforts directed towards our company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety plan of operation as a result of the change of control and the change in our management as noted herein our company now intends to investigate additional opportunities in an effort to enhance shareholder value those efforts are initially anticipated to focus on the development of stem cell banking cryopreserved in asia with the expectation that primary customers would come from china in order to pursue this initiative we anticipate that our cash requirements for the next twelve months shall

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record

contributions may be tax deductible get started ask away we have answers common questions what is a limited liability company a limited liability company or llc is a business entity created under state law that combines characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are generally not personally liable for company debts like a sole proprietorship or a partnership an llc is by default a pass through entity for tax purposes this means that the llc does not pay taxes on its profits but instead profits and losses are passed through to the owners who must then pay tax on their share of llc income how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation what is the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation s corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability do i need a name or dba for my business you only need a dba doing business as if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business

corporation and an s corporation c corporations are subject to double taxation that is one tax at the corporate level on the corporations net income and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed s corporations have only one level of taxation all of their income is allocated to the shareholders however c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield

an s corporation get started by answering a few questions about your company and we will file your paperwork with the secretary of state how do i choose a corporate name in general the name of a corporation must end with incorporated corporation or an abbreviation of one of these a name will not be accepted if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name of another corporation already formed in that state many states also restrict the use of certain terms in a corporations name like bank police or insurance legalzoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names in order of preference we will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are available please note that for government purposes the names abc inc and abc corp are identical therefore you should disregard spaces periods and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name choices if the name of your corporation will be used in connection with goods or services you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark protection for the name this helps ensure that no one else in the us may use that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services except in areas where someone else is already using that name is a corporation required to have a registered agent each corporation must have a registered agent some states use the term resident agent or statutory agent but the concept is the same this is the person designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the corporation is served with a lawsuit most states require that the registered agent must be either  an adult living in the state of formation with a street address po boxes are not acceptable or  a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation that provides registered agent services one of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is that any officer or director of a corporation or manager or member of an llc can act as the registered agent however there are some advantages to having another person or company act as your registered agent first this adds an extra layer of privacy since the registered agents name and address are publicly available second this helps limit the risk that if your corporation or llc is named as a defendant in a lawsuit no one will surprise you at home on a sunday night with court papers how much will it cost to form and run a corporation each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation in many states you
