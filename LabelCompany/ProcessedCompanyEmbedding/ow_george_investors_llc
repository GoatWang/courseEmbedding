quantum fund he has been a frequent interviewee or panelist for financial publications and news programs rogers shorted stocks of wall street investment banks ahead of the  crash money says back then high debt loads were a catalyst for the crash today rogers points out that debt loads are vastly bigger notably in the us china and the federal reserve regarding the magnitude of the upcoming crash

sign of overvaluation indeed he finds that stock prices are out of control per money with the market pe ratio nearly double its historical average once a selloff begins faber expects it to become an avalanche in which asset holders will lose  of their assets and some people will lose everything as money quotes him second faber says the market isnt healthy because only a small number of stocks are driving the major indexes upward per money we have a bubble in everything he told cnbc however in an earlier cnbc segment faber was castigated by another guest for consistently forecasting a market crash since  for more see also why the sp  is healthier than it looks bill gross fixed income manager janus capital group bill gross cofounded pacific investment management co llc or pimco where he

a recession to be unlikely over the next  months barrons reports however he adds that a global recession within the next five years has a  probability based on history barrons also notes that the forecasting prowess of jim rogers and marc faber is questionable they have been wrongly bearish for years and those who followed their advice in the recent past would have missed out on the bull
