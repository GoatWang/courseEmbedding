hunter resources corporation gary evans poses for a portrait at the companys new headquarters in irving thomson reuters by terry wade houston reuters  gary evans a wildcatter who left his job as chief executive of magnum hunter resources just as it emerged from bankruptcy on monday is wasting no time getting back into the oil business despite the worst price rout in years he has already formed a new venture called energy hunter resources inc and is close to buying two tracts of land in the oilrich permian basin and eagle ford fields of texas evans told reuters on tuesday evans who started his most successful oil company for  in  near the bottom of a price crash and later sold it for  billion is an eternal optimist much like many risktaking wildcatters all the veterans in the business know that this is a phenomenal time to get something new going when everybody else is running for the hills he said evans declined to discuss the size of the parcels he is purchasing but said the privately held tracts had enough space to drill about  wells that would cost about  million each im a big believer that oil prices this time next year will be  to  higher per barrel so id like to drill some now and capture some of that upside he said the land is not currently producing but is surrounded by active oil fields he said evans said he was targeting the eagle ford and the permian basin two of the countrys top tight oil fields because he has worked there before and their sweet spots with the oiliest rock still offer profits with oil near  a barrel these two plays in this current commodity cycle offer the best opportunity for finding unique deals he said you have to be in a sweet spot  thats what is very hard to find evans is restricted for one year from buying working interests in the marcellus and utica natural gas fields in the eastern united states where magnum hunter operates magnum hunter which exited bankruptcy this week with zero debt has said it is looking for a new ceo as it tries to regain its footing after oil and natural gas prices fell by half since mid evans  said the first round of financing for energy hunter resources will be a private placement with friends and family later he said he may tap public capital markets where he has raised some  billion over his career he said the current bankruptcy wave which has ensnared about  oil and gas companies is hitting as derivatives expire that companies had used to protect against the price crash liquidity helped fuel the us fracking revolution and more money was available in the latest boom which came at a time of recordlow federal reserve interest rates than in previous cycles i dont think theres any doubt that access to capital  whether it is the fed hedge funds or private equity  is  times greater now
