to drive listener hours through refer a friend and the social media sharing features in the universalplayer™ viral listeners are generated for us and our content providers providing a tool for growth   competition   competition for listeners   a number of factors affect how we compete for listening time these include the demand and accessibility of the content the quality of the listening experience advertising perception brand awareness and the advertising dollars spent on marketing campaigns we offer our service at no cost providing unlimited listening to listeners we also award loyalty points and provide viral incentives to our listeners which we believe helps grow our listenership many of our current and potential future competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages including greater brand recognition longer operating histories larger marketing budgets as well as greater technical personal financial and other resources we compete for listeners with other content providers including satellite radio providers such as sirius xm terrestrial and online radio providers such as clear channel slacker and iheart and services such as pandora that provide personalized content   while we believe that our service and business model will result in us gaining a larger market share competition for listeners could result in listeners moving or not coming onto our platform in favor of a competing service our ability to operate and grow is dependent on generating additional listeners   competition for content providers   we face competition from providers of other streaming platforms that offer services and tools to content providers the content delivery marketplace continues to evolve rapidly providing listeners with a growing number of alternatives and new content delivery platforms   our primary competitors include clear channel cumulus media soundcloud spotify tunein triton media and pandora unlike our primary competitors we do not own radio stations and are a technology platform that is not affiliated with or controlled by a major media company or broadcaster we believe this operating model gives us distinct advantages including not limited to being liable for the content royalties that these competitors are we market our platform to content providers that we believe will have desirable listening audiences our technology provides these content providers with a way to eliminate broadband streaming expenses and earn increased revenue while holding the content provider responsible for content royalties   we believe that the quality diversity and breadth of our programming and services coupled with our advertising sales forces and unique monetization model supported by our technology enable us to compete effectively with other forms of media and content delivery networks while we believe our platform offers unique advantages over other streaming platforms content providers may choose not to stream using our platform

vevo or youtube we compete for the time and attention of listeners with all other media forms these content services pose a competitive threat   competition for advertisers   we compete with other content providers for higher advertising rates and a share of our advertising customers’ overall marketing budgets a number of factors impact competition for advertisers including but not limited to technology capabilities budgets pricing structures the ability to generate successful campaign metrics return on investment and targeting abilities we believe that our video instream ad insertion technology gives us a unique advantage however securing budget and premium rates from advertisers is intensely competitive and rapidly changing with new companies entering the market and the introduction of new technologies we expect competition to increase and potentially have an adverse effect   our competitors include   other internet companies  as web based advertising becomes more popular the market for online advertising is becoming increasingly competitive we compete for online advertisers with other internet websites such as pandora spotify aol slacker apple radio facebook google msn and yahoo these large internet companies with greater brand recognition may have greater funding more skilled personal technology and intellectual property advantages and consequently enjoy significant advantages   broadcast radio  terrestrial and satellite broadcasting are significant sources of competition for advertising dollars these providers deliver ads across platforms that may be more familiar to traditional advertisers than the internet or mobile advertising opportunity we offer advertisers may not want to migrate advertising dollars to our internetbased platform because of this source of competition   television and print media providers  traditional media companies in television and print such as cbs abc and nbc are a source of competition for advertising dollars these traditional media types present competitive challenges in attracting advertising dollars including larger established audiences greater operating history and greater brand recognition   competition for fantasy sports players   we compete with other daily fantasy sports companies for usersplayers competing with these large companies with an established footprint may prove to be difficult these large companies with greater brand recognition may have greater funding more skilled personal technology and intellectual property advantages and consequently enjoy significant advantages   government

total revenue for the years ended august   and  respectively we deliver content on mobile devices through our radioloyalty™ app but we do not currently generate significant mobile advertising revenues management believes that mobile advertising represents an opportunity for the company in the next coming years and on an ongoing basis we streamed content to our listeners for over  million hours during the fiscal year ended august   a total of  of these listener hours were generated by listeners through our webbased universal player™ with the remainder of listener hours delivered on tablet computers smartphones and other mobile devices management expects the mobile advertising market will grow at substantial rates in the coming years however many challenges exist in this market we believe these challenges will be solved primarily with new technologies we believe our current technologies and other technology under development will solve some of these challenges by solving these challenges we will be able to monetize the mobile listenership we are growing today from september   to august   we had  listening hours streamed through mobile devices from september   to august   we had  hours streamed through mobile devices due to the inability of apple’s ios devices to run flash and the different technical frameworks that run mobile devices versus online desktop devices serving ads inside of mobile devices involves other complexities from a technical perspective as compared to serving ads inside of our desktop universalplayer™ we are currently unable to utilize our video instream technology inside of our current apps however depending upon the availability of capital we will invest in the development of our video instream technology in the mobile format   key metrics   we track listener hours because it is the best key indicator of the growth of our radioloyalty™ business revenues from advertising through our radioloyalty™ platform represented substantially all of revenues for the year ended august   we also track the number of registered users on our radioloyalty™ webbased product as well as the radioloyalty™ app as indicators of the size and quality of our audience which are particularly important to potential advertisers we plan to expand our internet product portfolio in the year ending august   once these products are launched we will determine key indicators of growth for those products   we calculate actual listener hours using our internal analytics systems some of our competitors do not always calculate their listener hours in the same way we do as a result their stated listener hours may not represent a truly comparable figure    player launches are defined as the number of individual times the universalplayer™ was launched the universalplayer™ is launched by users who want to access internet radio content the majority of users click from a “listen live” button on our broadcast partner’s websites or through our station guide at httpradioloyaltycomstationguideindexphp or our publisher sites we also work with internet radio guides such as tuneincom users can click on stations that broadcast with us to listen to content which launches the universalplayer™ registered users have signed up to earn loyalty points whereas all users have not signed up to earn loyalty points for users to launch the universalplayer™ they do not have to be a registered user the universalplayer™ needs to be launched with each successive use by users and not only the first time users listen to content   registered users are defined as the number of users who have signed up for an account with us in order to access our broadcasters’ content and to earn loyalty points the number of registered users may overstate the number of actual unique individuals who have signed up for an account with us in order to earn loyalty points as an individual may register for and use multiple accounts under unique brands or private labels we define registered users as those who have signed up with us to receive loyalty points we calculate this by the number of submissions we receive from users signing up for our loyalty service   stations are defined as the total of all stations created by our broadcasters a single broadcaster may create many stations and these stations may be active or inactive      table of contents   listener hours are calculated as follows when the universalplayertm is launched a session is created  this is considered the listeners start time at one minute following the launch of the universalplayertm we record that as  minute of listening time if a session lasts between  and  seconds we record that as  seconds of listening time at tenminute intervals following the session being created we count each  minute period as listening time so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am we will recognize  minute of listening time at  then  minutes of listening time at   minutes at  etc   the last event we see for the user is considered the end of their session events are user interactions such as a  minute interval clicking song likedislike sharing what they are listening to checking the news through our news app in the player etc we then take that time minus the time the session started to determine how long the session is so for example if a user launched the universalplayer tm at am and liked a song at am but exited the player at am we would recognize that as  minutes of listening   the tables below set forth our listener hours for the year ended august   our player launches and our

reduction revenue based on the recent changes within the newly published industry best practices that include but are not limited to the reduction in broadcaster publishing due to increased broadcaster royalty obligations lower cpm rates due to new advertising industry standards adoption of new advertising measurements which reduces the revenue per listening hour along with various other direct or indirect impacts that alter our existing and future initiatives we will continue to monitor the constantly evolving industry standards to best identify when we should resume our previous initiatives should they remain intact under newly formed best practices in order to operate the radioloyaltytm online broadcasting platform radioloyaltytm mobile and tablet apps and our adserving technologies we require substantial computing power hosting and streaming hosting we utilize asw’s cloud for streaming we refer to these costs as colocation services our advertising sales arrangements with over  radioloyaltytm stations facilitate us paying the broadcasters a monthly revenue sharing fee or license fee in exchange for advertising inventory around their content and listenership we refer to these costs as broadcaster commissions in the event that we purchase the ad inventory other costs of sales include depreciation associated with the computer servers from our previous two

company acquired certain assets in february  that exist in a relatively new industry that recently came under scrutiny the company believes it was in its’ best interest to delay the development and deployment strategy relating to these assets until the standard was published or defined in a way that the company could reasonably rely upon it we have a broadbased business strategy to acquire more broadcasters directly enter into joint ventures revenue sharing arrangements or similar contracts with internet radio station guides aggregators and consider mergers and acquisition targets on an ongoing basis product development costs were associated with continuing improvements to the software and related infrastructure for our primary product offering as well as development work on our online product portfolio including the robot fruit streamtrak amped fantasy fantify sportsalert and mobile technology the company believes it was in its’ best interest to delay certain product development initiatives and to discontinue certain operational directives due to a number of contributing factors relating to newly proposed industry regulations and royalty standards given the recent uncertainty in the industry the company believed that it was in the company’s best interest to focus on our core offering until there was a more defined industry standard thus it was best to delay future capital investments into our future development strategies previously mentioned we anticipate these costs to increase in the current fiscal year assuming that the industry standards or best practices are published marketing and sales costs included compensation for our sales staff and various internet marketingrelated costs will increase upon the company’s satisfaction of a newly published industry standards or best practices rents were primarily related to three leases we were obligated under for our santa barbara california office officer compensation related to a variety of accruals to the two primary executives that operate our business bad debts were substantial higher in the prior year primarily because of reserve needed in connection with one customer and other

cash funds held at major financial institutions we had net a working capital deficit of  as of august   compared to a net working capital deficit of  as of august   our principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ending august   were funding our operations as described below   going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business for the year ended august   the company recorded a net loss of  and had negative working capital as of august   of  the net loss and negative working capital indicates that the company may have difficulty continuing as a going concern   management is confident but cannot guarantee that additional capital can be raised in order to repay debts and continue operations during the fiscal year ending august   the company is obligated to make payments on certain convertible debts and a capital lease normal operating costs are also significant and include product development costs and marketing and sales costs associated with management’s business plan additionally the company is currently in default on its capital lease since inception and through august   the company has successfully raised a significant amount of capital additionally the company anticipates launching several new product offerings in the fiscal year ending august   the company expects those products to be profitable but notes that it will require significant capital for product development and ultimately commercially deployment however the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan in order to reach breakeven and become profitable if the company is unable to become profitable or sustain its cash flow the company could be forced to modify its business operations or possibly cease operations entirely management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in its operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern      table of contents    working capital related party financing   the company has only been operating since november   as a result the company has an extremely limited credit history the company’s chief executive officer and the chief executive officer of streamtrack media inc use their personal credit cards to fund operations on a frequent basis if the company did not have access to these credit cards the company would have to rely exclusively on external sources of capital the company’s external sources of capital are not always readily available once the company’s track record is more established and results of operations are profitable then external sources of capital should become more readily available as a result in timeconstrained circumstances the use of personal credit cards is necessary until such time as the company is able to build up its own creditworthiness and access more readily available and significant credit   our indebtedness   as of august   we had issued a total of  in current convertible promissory notes and  in long term convertible promissory notes that remained outstanding we also owe significant balances under a line of credit a lease agreement for computer servers and significant balances are owed to the two primary executives that operate our business   as of august   the conversion price of a total of  of the company’s convertible notes and accrued interest is based upon discounts ranging from  to the thenprevailing price of the company’s common stock as a result the lower the stock price at the time the investor converts the notes the more common shares the investor will receive    to the extent the investor converts the notes and then sells its common stock the common stock may decrease due to the additional shares in the market this could allow the investor to receive greater amounts of common stock upon conversion the sale of each share of common stock further depresses the stock price   due to the floating conversion price of the notes the company does not know the exact number of shares that the investors would be issued upon conversion as of august   if the investors elected to convert the notes to common shares the investors would have been issued approximately  shares of the company’s common stock if the investors had made an election to convert the notes as of august   this issuance would have represented approximately  of the issued and outstanding common stock as of august      the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes may result in substantial dilution to the interests of the company’s other shareholders in this regard even though the investor may not hold shares amounting to more than  of the outstanding shares at one time this restriction does not prevent the investor from selling some of its holdings and then receiving additional shares in this way the investor could sell more than  limit while never holding more than the limit      table of contents    line of credit   on april   the company closed a nondilutive line of credit financing for  with an institutional fund subsequently on september   the institutional fund has increased the company’s line of credit to    capital expenditures   based on current estimates we believe that our anticipated capital expenditures will be adequate to implement our current plans   historical trends   the following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended august   and        fiscal year ended august                              net cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations           net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations              net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations                 cash flow used in operating activities totaled  for the year ended august   compared to  used in operations for the year ended august   operating cash flow was negative during the year ended august   due to our reduction of online traffic in operations and the increase in accounts payable   cash flow provided by investing activities was  for the year ended august   as compared to  used in the year ended august   during fiscal  we capitalized costs in connection with various products in which were are currently developing however we ceased capitalizing costs in fiscal  the products were launched in fiscal  during february  the company entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with electric lightwave to which electric lightwave purchased from the company certain assets related to the companys data center located in santa barbara including equipment and inventory for a purchase price of  as of the date of the sale all the assets were fully depreciated in connection with the transaction the company recorded a gain of  as rent deposit of  was transferred as part of the sale which is recorded within gain on sale of colocation and domain on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations the company sold the watchthiscom domain name for  which is recorded within gain on sale of colocation and domain on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations   cash flow provided by financing activities were  for the year ended august   compared to  provided by for the year ended august   we raised substantial capital to fund operations from our existing line of credit and through the issuance of convertible promissory notes from related parties during the years ended august   and       table of contents   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of august   and  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements   quarterly trends   our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate in future quarters   our results may reflect the effects of some seasonal trends in listener behavior due to increased internet usage and sales of mediastreaming devices during vacation and holiday periods we may experience higher advertising sales during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater advertiser demand during the holiday season and lower advertising sales during the first quarter of each calendar year results from a generally decreased advertising demand while we believe these seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our operating results our lack of operating history provides for less insight into the effect of these factors we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future seasonal variations in listener behavior may result in fluctuations in our financial results   in addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and discretionary in nature reflecting overall economic conditions the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries budgeting constraints buying patterns and a variety of other factors many of these market conditions are not possible for us to control   critical accounting policies and estimates   our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates   we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition costs of revenues stock based compensation and accounting for income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates   revenue recognition   the company’s revenue is principally derived from advertising services   the company recognizes revenue when  persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collection is reasonably assured for all revenue transactions the company considers a signed agreement a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement      table of contents   advertising revenue  the company generates advertising revenue primarily from display and video advertising the company generates the majority of its advertising revenue through the delivery of advertising impressions sold on a cost per thousand or cpm basis currently advertising revenues are generated through our proprietary technologies from internetbased content the company does not currently generate significant revenues from mobile advertising in determining whether an arrangement exists the company ensures that a binding arrangement such as an insertion order or a fully executed customerspecific agreement is in place the company generally recognizes revenue based on delivery information from its campaign trafficking systems   the company also generates advertising revenue pursuant to arrangements with advertising agencies and brokers under these arrangements the company provides the agencies and brokers the ability to sell advertising inventory on the company’s service directly to advertisers the company reports this revenue net of amounts due to agencies and brokers because the company is not the primary obligor under these arrangements the company does not set the pricing and does not establish or maintain the relationship with the advertisers in some events smaller advertisers are reported as gross revenue with an expense recorded against the revenue   services revenue the company generated services revenues for the period from september   through august   these revenues related to the provision of data and streaming hosting services to one customer   deferred revenue  deferred revenue consists of both prepaid unrecognized revenues and advertising fees received or billed in advance of the delivery or completion of the services or in instances when revenue recognition criteria have not been met deferred revenue is recognized when the services are provided and all revenue recognition criteria have been met   multipleelement arrangements  the company could potentially enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time or within close proximity of one another the company uses the prospective method for all arrangements entered into or materially modified from the date of adoption that involve multiple element arrangements under this new guidance the company allocates arrangement consideration in multipledeliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables or those packages in which all components of the package are delivered at the same time based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy which includes  vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available  thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available and  best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available   vsoe  the company determines vsoe based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe the company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range the company has not historically priced its advertising products within a narrow range as a result the company has not been able to establish vsoe for any of its advertising products   tpe  when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements the company applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally the company’s gotomarket strategy differs from that of its peers and its offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained furthermore the company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services’ selling prices are on a standalone basis as a result the company has not been able to establish selling price based on tpe      table of contents   besp  when it is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company uses besp in its allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in the company’s multiple element arrangements the company determines besp for deliverables by considering multiple factors including but not limited to prices it charges for similar offerings market conditions competitive landscape and pricing practices the company limits the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables the company regularly reviews besp changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement may cause an increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that the company reports in a particular period   the company recognizes the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met   cost of revenue   cost of revenue consists of the revenuesharing amounts paid to broadcasters and publishers who provide us with their content and listenership infrastructure costs related to content streaming costs related to creating and serving advertisements as well as third party ad serving technology providers the company makes payments to thirdparty ad servers for the period the advertising impressions or clickthrough actions are delivered or occur and accordingly the company records this as a cost of revenue in the related period   stockbased compensation   stockbased payments made to employees including grants of restricted stock units and employee stock options are recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has previously issued restricted stock units and has not issued any employee stock options to date the company recognizes stockbased compensation for awards granted that are expected to vest on a straightline basis using the singleoption attribution method over the service period of the award which is generally three years because the restricted stock units vest on a daily basis the company has estimated the forfeiture rate of these stock awards to be  should the company issue stockbased compensation in the form of employee stock options the resulting expense recognized in the statements of operations may been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the forfeiture rates used for valuing stockbased compensation payments would be estimated based on historical experience the company would estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award is affected by the deemed fair value of the underlying stock price on the grant date as well as other assumptions including the riskfree interest rate the estimated volatility of the company’s stock price over the term of the award the estimated period of time that the company expects employees to hold their stock options and the expected dividend rate   the company has elected to use the “with and without” approach as described in accounting standards codification  tax provisions in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized as a result the company will only recognize a tax benefit from stockbased awards in additional paidin capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the company have been utilized in addition the company has elected to account for the indirect effects of stockbased awards on other tax attributes such as the research tax credit through the statement of operations      table of contents   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in the company’s tax returns deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized   the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon settlement the company will recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision in the accompanying statement of operations   the company calculates the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed income tax returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal and state tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made   item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we have operations wholly within the united states and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business including inflation risks   inflation risk   we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so

contents   total sports media inc formerly known as streamtrack inc notes to consolidated financial statements      description of business and basis of presentation     total sports media inc

platform the “platform” to over  internet and terrestrial radio stations and other broadcast content providers the platform consists of a webbased and mobile player that manages streaming audio and video content social media engagement display and video ad serving within the web player and is also capable of replacing audio ads with video ads within the web player in a live or ondemand environment the company offers the platform directly to its broadcasters and integrates or white labels its technologies with webbased internet radio guides and other webbased content providers the company is also continuing development of amped fantasy and sportsalert™ a fantasy sports product the company was incorporated as a wyoming corporation on may     basis of presentation   the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in the opinion of the company’s management the consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the company’s financial position for the periods presented   going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business for the year ended august   the company recorded a net loss of  and had negative working capital of  the net loss and negative working capital indicate substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern    management is confident but cannot guarantee that additional capital can be raised in order to repay debts and continue operations for the twelve months ending august   the company is obligated to make payments on certain convertible debts and a capital lease the companys normal operating costs are also significant and include consulting fees professional fees product development costs and marketing and sales costs associated with management’s business plan since inception and through the date of these financial statements the company has successfully raised a significant amount of capital through debt and equity offerings the company anticipates launching several new product offerings and initiating certain new significant partnerships during the fiscal year ending august   the company anticipates those products and partnerships to be profitable but notes that it will require an unknown amount of capital for product development and commercial deployment the company will attempt to have its potential partners pay for the some of these costs but management cannot be certain that it will succeed in entering into such arrangements management may potentially make a business decision to move forward delay or cancel certain partnerships because of the company’s overall capital needs nonetheless the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan and become profitable if the company is unable to become profitable and sustain positive cash flow from operations the company could be forced to modify its business operations or possibly cease operations entirely management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in its operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented estimates are used for determining the allowance for doubtful accounts stockbased compensation fair values of warrants to purchase common stock derivative liabilities and income taxes to the extent there are material differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results the company’s financial statements could be affected in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result   segments   the company operates in one segment the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” its chief executive officer manages the company’s operations on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources when evaluating the company’s financial performance the codm reviews separate revenue and expense information for the company’s radioloyaltytm watchthistm streamtrack media amped fantasy sportsalert fantify and other online product offerings while all other financial information is reviewed on a consolidated basis all of the company’s principal operations are located in goleta california     f table of contents       summary of significant accounting policies   revenue recognition   the company’s revenue is principally derived from advertising services   the company recognizes revenue when  persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collection is reasonably assured for all revenue transactions the company considers a signed agreement a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement   advertising revenue  the company generates advertising revenue primarily from display and video advertising the company generates the majority of its advertising revenue through the delivery of advertising impressions sold on a cost per thousand or cpm basis currently advertising revenues are generated through our proprietary technologies from internetbased content the company does not currently generate significant revenues from mobile advertising in determining whether an arrangement exists the company ensures that a binding arrangement such as an insertion order or a fully executed customerspecific agreement is in place the company generally recognizes revenue based on delivery information from its campaign trafficking systems   the company also generates advertising revenue pursuant to arrangements with advertising agencies and brokers under these arrangements the company provides the agencies and brokers the ability to sell advertising inventory on the company’s service directly to advertisers the company reports this revenue net of amounts due to agencies and brokers because the company is not the primary obligor under these arrangements the company does not set the pricing and does not establish or maintain the relationship with the advertisers in some events smaller advertisers are reported as gross revenue with an expense recorded against the revenue   services revenue  the company generated services revenues for the period from september   through august   these revenues related to the provision of data and streaming hosting services to one customer   deferred revenue  deferred revenue consists of both prepaid unrecognized revenues and advertising fees received or billed in advance of the delivery or completion of the services or in instances when revenue recognition criteria have not been met deferred revenue is recognized when the services are provided and all revenue recognition criteria have been met   multipleelement arrangements  the company could potentially enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time or within close proximity of one another the company uses the prospective method for all arrangements entered into or materially modified from the date of adoption that involve multiple element arrangements under this new guidance the company allocates arrangement consideration in multipledeliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables or those packages in which all components of the package are delivered at the same time based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy which includes  vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available  thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available and  best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available   vsoe  the company determines vsoe based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe the company requires that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range the company has not historically priced its advertising products within a narrow range as a result the company has not been able to establish vsoe for any of its advertising products     f table of contents    tpe  when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements the company applies judgment with respect to whether it can establish a selling price based on tpe tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally the company’s gotomarket strategy differs from that of its peers and its offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained furthermore the company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services’ selling prices are on a standalone basis as a result the company has not been able to establish selling price based on tpe   besp  when it is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe the company uses besp in its allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which the company would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis besp is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in the company’s multiple element arrangements the company determines besp for deliverables by considering multiple factors including but not limited to prices it charges for similar offerings market conditions competitive landscape and pricing practices the company limits the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables the company regularly reviews besp changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement may cause an increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that the company reports in a particular period   the company recognizes the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with domestic financial institutions of high credit quality the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of all of such institutions   the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers to assess the probability of accounts receivable collection based on a number of factors including past transaction experience with the customer evaluation of their credit history and review of the invoicing terms of the contract the company generally does not require collateral the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary actual credit gains losses during the fiscal years ended august   and  totaled  and  respectively   cash and cash equivalents   the company classifies its highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations as of each investment as of the balance sheet date for each reporting period the company classifies its investments as either shortterm or longterm based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date investments with maturities of less than  months are classified as shortterm and those with maturities greater than  months are classified as longterm the cost of investments sold is based upon the specific identification method     f table of contents   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts   accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical loss patterns the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts the company also considers any changes to the financial condition of its customers and any other external market factors that could impact the collectability of its receivables in the determination of its allowance for doubtful accounts   property and equipment   property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization computer servers and potentially other assets that are controlled by the company under lease obligations are reviewed to determine whether the assets should be capitalized and a capital lease obligation recorded as a liability on the balance sheets depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows   internally developed and purchased software computer servers and computers    years office furniture and equipment    to  years leasehold improvements   shorter of the estimated useful life of  years or the lease term   property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if property and equipment are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value   internal use software and website development costs   costs incurred to develop software for internal use are required to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset if certain criteria are met costs related to design or maintenance of internaluse software are expensed as incurred the company evaluates the costs incurred during the application development stage of website development to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for capitalization costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred for the year ended august   and  the company capitalized  and  in costs related to internal use software and website development respectively management also determined that  and  in certain software and website development costs did not meet the relevant criteria to be capitalized during fiscal  and  respectively as a result all of these costs were expensed and included within the accompanying statement of operations as “product development” during the years indicated see note  for discussion related to the impairment of a product   derivatives   the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks the company reviews the terms of the common stock warrants to purchase common stock and debt instruments it issues to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments including embedded conversion options which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments in circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument including the conversion option that is required to be bifurcated the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single compound derivative instrument bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as nonoperating income or expense the company uses a blackscholes model for valuation of the derivative when the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments the remaining proceeds if any are then allocated to the host instruments themselves usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value the discount from the face value of the convertible debt together with the stated interest on the instrument is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense using the effective interest method derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether net cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within the  months of the balance sheet date     f table of contents   stockbased compensation   stockbased payments made to employees and nonemployees including grants of restricted stock units and employee stock options are recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values the company has previously issued restricted stock units and has not issued any employee stock options to date the company recognizes stockbased compensation for awards granted to employees that are expected to vest on a straightline basis using the singleoption attribution method over the service period of the award which is generally three years the company recognizes stockbased compensation for awards granted to nonemployees over the expected service period revaluing the award at each reporting period in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance because the restricted stock units vest on a daily basis the company has estimated the forfeiture rate of these stock awards to be  should the company issue stockbased compensation in the form of employee stock options the resulting expense recognized in the statements of operations may been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the forfeiture rates used for valuing stockbased compensation payments would be estimated based on historical experience the company would estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholes valuation model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award is affected by the deemed fair value of the underlying stock price on the grant date as well as other assumptions including the riskfree interest rate the estimated volatility of the company’s stock price over the term of the award the estimated period of time that the company expects employees and nonemployees to hold their stock awards and the expected dividend rate   the company has elected to use the “with and without” approach as described in accounting standards codification  tax provisions in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized as a result the company will only recognize a tax benefit from stockbased awards in additional paidin capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the company have been utilized in addition the company has elected to account for the indirect effects of stockbased awards on other tax attributes such as the research tax credit through the statement of operations   cost of revenue   cost of revenue consists of the revenuesharing amounts paid to broadcasters and publishers who provide us with their content and listenership infrastructure costs related to content streaming costs related to creating and serving advertisements as well as third party ad serving technology providers the company makes payments to thirdparty ad servers for the period the advertising impressions or clickthrough actions are delivered or occur and accordingly the company records this as a cost of revenue in the related period   consulting fees   several consultants were involved in the company’s business development activities and also provided the company with financial advisory services during the years ended august   and  the company does have ongoing commitments with the majority of the consultants the company worked with during the years ended august   and    professional fees   professional fees include legal fees for entertainment audio video and radio industryspecific issues legal fees for sec reporting and audit fees associated with the sec compliance of the company   product development   the company incurs product development expenses consisting of consulting fees employee compensation information technology and facilitiesrelated expenses the company incurs product development expenses primarily for development and improvements to the universal playertm the radioloyaltytm online and mobile content integration and development of new advertising products or development enhancement of other new technologies and its fantasy sports products the company expenses product development costs to the extent they cant be capitalized under the pertaining accounting guidance     f table of contents   marketing and sales   marketing and sales expenses consist of consulting fees employee compensation commissions and benefits related to employees in sales marketing and advertising departments in addition marketing and sales expenses include external sales and marketing expenses such as thirdparty marketing branding advertising and public relations expenses and infrastructure costs such as facility and other supporting overhead costs   officer compensation   the company’s officers are not currently under longterm contracts with the company during the years ended august   and  compensation was either accrued or paid to these executives out of operations from time to time but no formal compensation plan has been in place see notes  and  for additional information   general and administrative   general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and employee compensation for finance accounting internal information technology and other administrative personnel in addition general and administrative expenses include professional services costs for outside legal and accounting services and infrastructure costs for facility supporting overhead costs and merchant and other transaction costs such as credit card fees   content acquisition costs   content acquisition costs principally consist of amounts paid to internetbased terrestrial and mobile content providers the company did not incur any substantial content acquisition costs for the years ended august   and  respectively however these costs are likely to become substantial in the future as the company expands its online product portfolio   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in the company’s tax returns deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized   the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon settlement the company will recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision in the accompanying statement of operations   the company calculates the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed income tax returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by us federal and state tax authorities the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made     f table of contents   net loss per share   basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period   diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock including convertible debt instruments preferred stock restricted stock unit grants and detachable stock warrants basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been antidilutive   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board

customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method early adoption is not permitted the updated standard will be effective for the company beginning january   the company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   in august  the fasb

allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure of material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports based on the foregoing our management determined that our

maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule af the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the

financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or

circumstances in which the director was aware or should have been aware in the ordinary course of performing a director’s duties of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders v acts or omissions that constituted an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director’s duty to the corporation or its shareholders or vi approval of an unlawful dividend distribution stock repurchase or redemption this provision would generally absolve directors of personal liability for negligence in the performance of duties including gross negligence      table of contents   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to the foregoing provisions the company has been informed that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable   board committees   our board of directors does not have an audit committee and our full board of directors is presently performing the functions of an audit committee our board of directors does not have a compensation committee so all decisions with respect to management compensation are made by the whole board our board of directors does not have a nominating committee therefore the selection of persons or election to the board of directors was neither independently made nor negotiated at arm’s length   auditor independence   our board of directors has considered whether the provisions of nonaudit services are compatible with maintaining our auditors’ independence   report of the audit committee   our board of directors does not have an audit committee

requirements applicable to the company’s reporting persons during and with respect to the fiscal year ended august   have been complied with on a timely basis      table of contents   item  executive compensation   compensation discussion and analysis   the following compensation discussion and analysis describes the material elements of compensation for our executive officers identified in the summary compensation table “named executive officers” and executive officers that we may hire in the future as more fully described below our board of directors makes all decisions for the total direct compensation of our executive officers including the named executive officers we do not have a compensation committee so all decisions with respect to management compensation are made by the whole board   compensation program objectives and rewards   our compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting retaining and motivating exceptional leaders setting high goals working toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders and rewarding outstanding performance following this philosophy in determining executive compensation we consider all relevant factors such as the competition for talent our desire to link pay with performance in the future the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders individual contributions teamwork and performance and each executive’s total compensation package we strive to accomplish these objectives by compensating all executives with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive compensation   to date we have not applied a formal compensation program to determine the compensation of the named executives officers in the future as we and our management team expand our board of directors expects to add independent members form a compensation committee comprised of independent directors and apply the compensation philosophy and policies described in this section of the k   the primary purpose of the compensation and benefits described below is to attract retain and motivate highly talented individuals when we do hire who will engage in the behaviors necessary to enable us to succeed in our mission while upholding our values in a highly competitive marketplace different elements are designed to engender different behaviors and the actual incentive amounts which may be awarded to each named executive officer are subject to the annual review of the board of directors the following is a brief description of the key elements of our planned executive compensation structure   · base salary and benefits are designed to attract and retain employees over time · incentive compensation awards are designed to focus employees on the business objectives for a particular year · equity incentive awards such as stock options and nonvested stock focus executives’ efforts on the behaviors within the recipients’ control that they believe are designed to ensure our longterm success as reflected in increases to our stock prices over a period of several years growth in our profitability and other elements · severance and change in control plans are designed to facilitate a company’s ability to attract and retain executives as we compete for talented employees in a marketplace where such protections are commonly offered we currently have not given separation benefits to any of our name executive officers      table of contents   benchmarking   we have not yet adopted benchmarking but may do so in the future when making compensation decisions our board of directors may compare each element of compensation paid to our named executive officers against a report showing comparable compensation metrics from a group that includes both publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies our board believes that while such peer group benchmarks are a point of reference for measurement they are not necessarily a determining factor in setting executive compensation as each executive officer’s compensation relative to the benchmark varies based on scope of responsibility and time in the position we have not yet formally established our peer group for this purpose   benefits and prerequisites   at this stage of our business we have limited benefits and no prerequisites for our employees other than health insurance and vacation benefits that are generally comparable to those offered by other small private and public companies or as may be required by applicable state employment laws we may adopt retirement plans and confer other fringe benefits for our executive officers in the future if our business grows sufficiently to enable us to afford them   separation and change in control arrangements   we do not have any employment agreements with our named executive officers or any other executive officer or employee of the company none of them are eligible for specific benefits or payments if their employment or engagement terminates in a separation or if there is a change of control   executive officer compensation   the following summary compensation
