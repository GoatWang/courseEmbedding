to work in a sports environment if youre a sports fan the majority of the employees there are great and fun to work with you get free biscuits on fridaysconsthe company is not interested in investing in their employees there is no clearcut career path laid out for anyone youre lucky if you get a review once a year upper management including the president and ceo acknowledges the lack of structure and organization throughout the company but never actually fixes the problem as a result turnover has skyrocketed id be hardpressed to find one person at the company other than someone in upper management that will say they are happy with their job ive never seen so many unhappy employees throughout any place ive ever worked its inevitable that any time employees get together to hang out away from work the i hate smt conversations begindo not expect to get paid anywhere close to what the average salary is for your position you will get the absolute lowest pay possible raises are rare and extremely smallthere is also not a good balance between work and personal life management expects you to make yourself available after hours and on weekends this leads to tons of stressed and burnedout employees the work emails never stopemployees are taken for granted and hard work goes unappreciated and unnoticed for the most part even if it is noticed and acknowledged nothing will come of it if youre interested in finding a longterm career stay far far away from this place its quite a shame you look at this company from the outside and expect that it would be quite a fun and satisfying place to work sadly thats just not the caseadvice to managementtake the time to show appreciation for your employees that can go a long way give employees an incentive to go above and beyond set up a welldefined career path for each position and pay what they are truly worthshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via emailcopy linklink copiedflag as
