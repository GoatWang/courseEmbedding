wednesday  april   bst click to followthe independent online james macleod is the founder and ceo of audio news service clippet – and grandson of rupert murdoch charlie forghambailey natalie bennett has received a boost ahead of thursday night leaders’ debate – an unexpected endorsement from the house of murdochjames macleod rupert murdoch’s  yearold grandson who is making waves as a digital news entrepreneur has revealed he is voting green at the electionand like his grandfather macleod the cocreator of clippet a news app which delivers bitesized audio clips to “millennials” wants to use his influence ahead of next month’s pollmillennials the generation aged  are the target audience for clippet’s second summaries of the day’s most important storiesresearch commissioned by clippet found that millennials believe that it is important to vote but do not feel that traditional media including the outlets controlled by rupert murdoch are able to engage them in a language that they understandthe research found that  of young voters use social media as a source of news many felt that news is often jargonridden biased and not relevant to them if it’s presented by an older generation those who don’t vote said they lacked sufficient information to make an informed choiceread morerupert murdoch faces a digital challenge from clippetoccupy activists planning to arrest rupert murdochlynn barber on rupert murdochmacleod said “we are doing better at getting young people to vote but millennials are disengaged from any media that seems oldfashioned i personally don’t know what the policies on the nhs are of the leading parties but i’m not ashamed of that because i am a millennial”clippet the audio news app that macleod cofoundedmacleod the son of prudence mr murdoch’s eldest daughter and alasdair macleod a former news corp executive has not been persuaded by either of the main parties“i’m probably going to vote green” macleod who cycles to meetings revealed “i’m not particularly attracted to the tories and because i’m a londoner i’m quite an environmentalist“i think the greens have sound policies across the board and over the past four years they’ve strengthened their brand their social media strategy has really made them accessible to younger people”a dedicated election resource on clippet will deliver campaign news reports including vox pops of young people the site will also host a policy blog which will explain what “the big issues are in simple terms” macleod wants clippet’s clout to continue after the election “over the next five years i would like to see a committee within parliament made up from young people who are voted in by their peers that will have a real say in the house of commons” he saidmacleod who spent his teens in sydney came up with the clippet concept because he wanted something to listen to whilst cycling from paddington to the cass business school in east london the clippet style would be “conversational between radio ’s newsbeat and radio ”he dropped out of business school to pursue clippet with cofounder grace regan – macleod admits he was “not applying himself” to his studies but like his grandfather he is finding that there are bumps on the road to becoming a billionaire media mogul clippet’s distribution of less dataheavy audioonly clips challenges the conventional view that mobile video is the most effective way to reach a young audience“unfortunately we’ve come to a point in the road where we’re desperately trying to find money” macleod admitted “the numbers are pretty small right now around  clippets are played each day and right now we’re filling in the holes in the app we pumped a lot of money into the marketing and obviously the product wasn’t ready we now have a much better product”rupert murdoch james macleods grandfather gettymacleod hopes to license the technological platform behind clippet to other companies he did enjoy a spell working for mr murdoch’s fox news on the advertising sales side but won’t make the obvious call to news corp for a helping hand “i didn’t meet any of my team of advisers through news corp although will lewis chief executive officer of dow jones and former news corp manager was a great help we’ve been incredibly lucky that lots of people have kept faith in us”macleod desperately wants clippet to succeed under its own wind he and regan have divided up the company in order to get the business plan back on track he arrived at his goodge street offices unshaven admitting “i didn’t sleep last night you’ve caught me in the middle of a startup nightmare”is there anyone in his family he might call for advice on building a media empire has he demonstrated clippet to rupert  who struggled to adapt to the digital revolution “i’m getting into a place where my grandfather can’t say ‘no’ to it” macleod said “i get very funny reactions from my grandfather he goes either way depending on his mood…and his levels of sleep”would james consider selling clippet in the future “it depends who’s buying…and for what price” he has clearly inherited something of the dealmaking murdoch genegoing it alone – the murdoch childrenprudence

alexander farquharson militia officer lawyer nwmp officer magistrate judge and politician b probably  sept  in drynoch isle of skye scotland son of martin donald macleod and jane fry m  july  mary isabella drever and they had four daughters and one son d  sept  in calgary james farquharson macleod emigrated from scotland with his family in the summer of  his father purchased a farm at richmond hill north of toronto near the lands of john beverley robinson and the late william warren baldwin and in  he enrolled james who had been educated at home to this point at upper canada college financial difficulties forced his withdrawal in  but he returned three years later to pass with honours his final examinations and the entrance examination for queen’s college kingston during these years life on the farm influenced macleod at least as powerfully as his schooling hunting trips with his father and brothers left him with an abiding love of the outdoor life and the macleods’ friendship with a family of local ojibwa indians imparted to james a lifelong respect and admiration for the native people of canada macleod’s father who had lost seven brothers to tropical diseases while they were serving in the british and indian armies and who had himself fallen seriously ill while on military service in demerara guyana had left scotland to avoid a similar fate for his sons in his master plan for the family martin donald macleod saw a career in law for his son james and thus in  sent him to queen’s to obtain his ba after a year the young macleod announced his intention to become a civil engineer instead only an impassioned plea from his father caused him to remain in the arts which he found boring and in  he managed to graduate with an honours degree in classics and philosophy his lack of enthusiasm for the legal profession was evidenced by the fact that he twice failed the entrance examination for law studies at osgoode hall in  before passing in november  he then joined the kingston law office of alexander campbell to article but by this time he had found an activity that interested him much more than the law in the summer of  he had joined the volunteer militia field battery of kingston as a lieutenant and his enthusiasm was such that his brotherinlaw william augustus baldwin a son of william warren persuaded governor general sir edmund walker head to offer james a commission in the british army his father was naturally horrified and insisted that the offer be refused in  james passed his bar examinations at osgoode hall for the next decade he practised law at bowmanville and retained a strong interest in the militia transferred in  to the bowmanville volunteer militia rifle company which became part of the th west durham battalion of infantry four years later he was promoted captain in  and major in  active service during the trent affair in  see sir charles hastings doyle and the fenian raids of  see alfred booker confirmed his taste for the military in  through the political influence of his former employer alexander campbell now a cabinet minister in the dominion government and of prime minister sir john a macdonald macleod obtained a commission as brigade major with the expedition under colonel garnet joseph wolseley sent to quell the uprising in the red river settlement man see louis riel the arduous journey westward through the wilderness was made to order for macleod’s talents his leadership during the expedition earned him praise from his commanding officer as well as a cmg he remained with the canadian militia force at lower fort garry until the spring of  and while there he met mary isabella drever the daughter of a local trader their marriage plans were disrupted when macleod failed to obtain appointment as commanding officer of the garrison and returned to ontario macleod was promoted lieutenantcolonel in the th battalion of infantry in december  but his law practice and parttime soldiering no longer held much attraction for him in late  he left for england and scotland with the idea of remaining if he could find suitable employment in the spring of  prime minister macdonald offered him a commission as superintendent and inspector in the newly established northwest mounted police see patrick robertsonross macleod accepted and returned quickly to canada in october he left from collingwood ont for upper fort garry winnipeg with several other officers and  men during the winter of – macleod and the other officers began the training and organization of the nwmp at the stone fort lower fort garry under the command of commissioner george arthur french in december macleod commanded the first patrol to investigate a complaint that lumbermen on lake winnipeg were trading liquor to the indians and on  june  he was appointed the force’s first assistant commissioner in the spring of  the nwmp were ordered farther west to deal with american whisky traders operating near the fork of the bow and belly south saskatchewan rivers in what is now alberta under french macleod set out from dufferin man on  july with  men the trip turned out to be much longer and more difficult than expected at the end of july part of the force had to be detached and sent to fort edmonton edmonton with the weaker horses the remainder struggled on finally reaching their destination ragged and starving on  september macleod with half the force left under his command was ordered to establish a post near the border to control the whisky trade and french returned to manitoba by the end of october fort macleod alta had been established at a site chosen by mixedblood scout jerry potts on the oldman river and macleod was engaged in the work of suppressing the whisky trade and establishing relations with the different tribes of blackfoot indians in the region on  december macleod held the first of a series of meetings with native leaders blackfoot head chief crowfoot isapomuxika and blood head chief red crow mékaisto liked and trusted macleod from the start and agreed to cooperate in ending the whisky trade macleod did much to set the tone of patience reason and diplomacy for nwmp dealings with the native population which was to survive until the s macleod’s most serious problems during the winter of – were the result of isolation and boredom lack of horses prevented much activity the men had not been paid since leaving manitoba and their uniforms were in rags there were rumblings of mutiny and  men deserted in march macleod and a small party rode through a late winter blizzard to helena mont to pick up the men’s pay and receive the first instructions from ottawa since the departure of french while there macleod began proceedings for the extradition of several americans accused of the  massacre of a band of assiniboin indians in the cypress hills near battle creek sask see hunkajuka in may  macleod sent a troop under the command of inspector james morrow walsh to establish a post fort walsh sask in the cypress hills that summer inspector éphrema brisebois travelled to the bow river to build a second major outpost fort brisebois subsequently renamed fort calgary calgary by macleod after one of his favourite places on the isle of mull scotland most of his attention that summer was absorbed by the cypress hills massacre extradition case macleod and inspector acheson gosford irvine travelled to fort benton mont in june and arranged for the arrest of seven men thought to have been involved in the killings nwmp efforts to bring these men to justice aroused intense public hostility and the result of the extradition hearing held at helena in july was probably a foregone conclusion the prisoners were set free at the end of the month and macleod was even jailed for a few days on a charge of false arrest although macleod had initially got along well with commissioner french by the end of  relations between the two men were deteriorating french had been stuck at the swan river barracks livingstone sask the nwmp headquarters hundreds of miles from the scene of most operations while macleod in de facto control of the majority of the force for more than a year communicated directly with ottawa on all matters of importance french became increasingly critical of his assistant commissioner and under the circumstances macleod welcomed an appointment as stipendiary magistrate for the northwest territories on  jan  and left the force apart from professional considerations this appointment allowed him to return to winnipeg to carry out his long delayed plans to marry mary drever         macleod’s separation from the nwmp however was shortlived french at odds with the liberal government of alexander mackenzie over nwmp policy resigned in june  the post was offered to macleod and he accepted without hesitation taking over as commissioner on  july  in an age of untrammelled patronage it was remarkable for someone of macleod’s wellknown conservative connections to be appointed by a liberal administration the new commissioner plunged immediately into an exhausting round of activity after his wedding in winnipeg on  july he rode to fort carlton sask for the signing of treaty no with the plains cree see pītikwahanapiwīyin he then left for swan river to oversee the moving of nwmp headquarters to fort macleod both forts macleod and walsh were reinforced in anticipation of trouble from south of the border on  june the united states army had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the sioux leader sitting bull tatanka iyotank macleod was well aware that the americans would pursue sitting bull relentlessly and that the indians were likely to seek refuge in canada in december they began to arrive in the cypress hills area macleod had retained his appointment as stipendiary magistrate and under the terms of the northwest territories act of  he along with the two other territorial magistrates hugh richardson and matthew ryan was a member of the council of the northwest territories early in  he attended his first council meeting at swan river and then travelled on to ottawa for consultations on the problem of the sioux before returning to fort macleod in september  some  blackfeet bloods peigans sarcees and stoneys assembled at blackfoot crossing alta to sign treaty no crowfoot red crow and several other chiefs made it clear that macleod and the nwmp were the principal reasons their people were willing to sign the treaty the commissioner next rode on to fort walsh for talks between american authorities and sitting bull aimed at inducing the sioux to return to the united states macleod persuaded sitting bull to participate but the negotiations accomplished nothing macleod then interviewed sitting bull and set out the canadian government’s position the sioux could remain in canadian territory as long as they obeyed the law but there would be no treaties no reserves and no government rations for them by  macleod was becoming seriously worried about the rapidly decreasing numbers of buffalo on the plains the presence of the sioux intensified competition for an increasingly scarce food supply and threatened to lead to warfare among the plains tribes at the  meeting of the nwt council macleod introduced legislation that attempted to regulate the buffalo hunt in an effort to slow down the slaughter although well meant the regulations had little effect and by the end of the year the buffalo were alarmingly scarce because of his worries about the effect of food shortages on the canadian indians and pressures from ottawa to resolve the problem macleod became dissatisfied with the seemingly dilatory efforts of inspector walsh to persuade the sioux to leave the nwt the crisis macleod had feared arrived early in  when all the plains tribes faced starvation in the spring macleod made a lengthy visit to ottawa to discuss the situation with the recently reelected macdonald government he returned to the west in july bringing  new recruits as well as food supplies for distribution to the indians edgar dewdney the newly appointed indian commissioner travelled west with the nwmp he and macleod spent much of the last half of  visiting the indian agencies throughout the nwt in the spring of  the nwmp came under attack in parliament for financial carelessness there was some foundation for the charge macleod hated bookkeeping and had no talent for the management of money but it is doubtful that anyone however skilled could have done much better under the circumstances apart from his trip to ottawa macleod whose health was beginning to deteriorate under the strain travelled more than  miles by horse in  to conduct his police work and to fulfil his judicial responsibilities there was also a widening gap between macleod’s understanding of the government’s obligations towards the native peoples under the treaties and that of the macdonald administration in letters to his wife macleod expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s efforts to furnish foodstuffs for the destitute indians he commented “they appear still to think that the poor creatures can gain their livelihood by hunting as if everyone didn’t know that there is nothing for them to hunt” a break appeared almost inevitable at the end of september  macleod resigned as commissioner of the nwmp and began to devote all his time to his judicial duties the family moved to a small ranch at pincher creek alta where they attempted without much success to raise horses for sale to the nwmp as one of the three later four magistrates in the nwt macleod was primarily responsible for the bow river judicial district the holding of court in the larger towns twice yearly meant a constant round of travel for the magistrates macleod’s career as a jurist was not marked by any outstanding trials not a brilliant lawyer he appears none the less to have fulfilled his responsibilities both competently and conscientiously his decisions were not overturned on appeal more than those of his fellow magistrates and he did not get into the kind of trouble stemming from irregularities in conduct and abuse of authority that led to the dismissal of his contemporaries matthew ryan in  and jeremiah travis in  in september  macleod was sent to british columbia to resolve a dispute over jurisdiction between federal and provincial authorities both of whom claimed the right to police the construction camps of the canadian pacific railway through the exercise of his considerable diplomatic skills macleod was able to persuade federal and provincial magistrates to cooperate in enforcing the law on  feb  macleod was appointed to the first supreme court of the northwest territories as puisne judge for the judicial district of southern alberta he continued as a member of the nwt council until the legislative assembly was created to replace it in  he was then appointed one of the three legal advisers who sat as nonvoting members of the new assembly in the s the citizens of the growing city of calgary agitated for the removal of macleod’s judicial seat from fort macleod to calgary in may  he was appointed judge for both the northern and southern judicial districts with his residence in calgary and he moved there with his family already seriously ill with bright’s disease he took up his duties for only a short time before his health deteriorated rapidly and he died on  september james farquharson macleod exercised a decisive influence on the early development of western canada more than any other single individual he was responsible for establishing the policies followed by the nwmp in their dealings with the indians and for setting the tone of canadian indian policy in the nwt his vision of the region was of a place where newcomers and the native population might live
