via email share on google plus post on facebook wall share on twitter post to linkedin share on reddit intensive use of farm machinery will be essential to meet world food demand erin jonasson share on twitter by vesna poljak a us investor that backed amazon when it was a bookseller is bullish about the growth prospects for iconic tractor maker deere  coloomis sayles  companys growth strategy invests in businesses that are internet trailblazers it bought facebook visa and alibaba in their initial public offerings but it also identifies growth in businesses that are more salt of the earth than silicon valleyonly about  per cent of companies can sustain their growth more than four years and only about  per cent for  years the fund manager estimatesyou put that kind of company that can just get better over time on top of a secular growth engine those are rare says hollie briggs who is a bostonbased equity product manager at the firm the shift from brickandmortar to online isnt going to be done in another  years when we bought amazon the penetration rate was low single digits and now its around  per cent and thats after  years with what has seemed like rapid growth related quotes  years  day last updated updating last updated updating view full quote company profile asx announcements expand asx announcements view all announcements deere was added to the growth strategy last year having been in the library for five years as fears mounted in the market that the company risked having to write down some of its onbalance sheet leasesthe opportunity came because a lot of farmers have been leasing their tractors because cash receipts have been low but they still like their new tractors so theres a lot of residual value risk on deeres balance sheet right now ms briggs said that is an entirely quantifiable riskcrop yields have been high and crop receipts are low so sales are low but thats a shortterm headwind the longterm driver of growth for deere is the increase in population in the world its expected to increase by a third in  and theres no more arable landmechanisation and advanced seeds are two ways of improving the utilisation of existing land when deere reported secondquarter earnings in may it raised its fullyear earnings forecast to us billion  billionthe growth strategy also does not own any banks but does hold american express there are no australian stocks in the portfolio nor does it invest in apple the downside risk of apple is not knowableholding onto its amazon position which it started acquiring at around us a share in  its about whats to come thats the only thing that matters is whats ahead and what the opportunity is ms briggs saidrelentlessly visionary loomis sayles doesnt necessarily agree that share prices follow earnings focusing on cashflow returns on invested capitalif youre earning above your cost of capital youre creating shareholder value if youre earning less than youre eating up your capital you can have earnings growth but not be earning above your cost of capitalregarding the booming amazon web services or aws you might say its just luck because we certainly didnt know about it in  but you might attribute it to the type of management were looking for ms briggs said relentlessly visionarythe scale of amazon will have an impact on certain competitors as it builds a base in australia but not necessarily all of them she said ms briggs also recalled that in  about  per cent of amazons stock was targeted by short sellers everyone was thinking that they were just a bookseller they didnt have the vision that it was going to be able to expand into other categoriesloomis sayles and jeff bezos thought otherwise the market also responded negatively to amazons intention to make essential investments in its interfacesimilarly in its first year facebook had us million in mobilegenerated revenue that is now almost us billion they recovered quickly shall we saythe fund manager also owns mercadolibre an online marketplace that is the dominant player in many south american countries there are regional differences ms briggs said mercadolibre was winning market share even in brazil where the economy is severely challengedamazon spent  years in china and a lot of money and gained about  per cent market share it isnt a given that in every region theyre going to go in and own italibaba has managed to do something even amazon has not the big distinction for alibaba compared to say amazon in developed markets is that its creating new demandotherwise in the developed market online is a takeaway game in that it steals share from bricksandmortar retailersthe investment manager emphasises longterm investing it launched a global growth strategy at the start of  and has not bought or sold a single name outside of adding and trimming positionsoracle and cisco described as old tech have been in the portfolio since inception its average position size in amazon has been  per cent

use of farm machinery will be essential to meet world food demand erin jonasson share on twitter by vesna poljak a us investor that backed amazon when it was a bookseller is bullish about the growth prospects for iconic tractor maker deere  coloomis sayles  companys growth strategy invests in businesses that are internet trailblazers it bought facebook visa and alibaba in their initial public offerings but it also identifies growth in businesses that are more salt of the earth than silicon valleyonly about  per cent of companies can sustain their growth more than four years and only about  per cent for  years the fund manager estimatesyou put that kind of company that can just get better over time on top of a secular growth engine those are rare says hollie briggs who is a bostonbased equity product manager at the firm the shift from brickandmortar to online isnt going to be done in another  years when we bought amazon the penetration rate was low single digits and now its around  per cent and thats after  years with what has seemed like rapid growth related quotes  years  day last updated updating last updated updating view full quote company profile asx announcements expand asx announcements view all announcements deere was added to the growth strategy last year having been in the library for five years as fears mounted in the market that the company risked having to write down some of its onbalance sheet leasesthe opportunity came because a lot of farmers have been leasing their tractors because cash receipts have been low but they still like their new tractors so theres a lot of residual value risk on deeres balance sheet right now ms briggs said that is an entirely quantifiable riskcrop yields have been high and crop receipts are low so sales are low but thats a shortterm headwind the longterm driver of growth for deere is the increase in population in the world its expected to increase by a third in  and theres no more arable landmechanisation and advanced seeds are two ways of improving the utilisation of existing land when deere reported secondquarter earnings in may it raised its fullyear earnings forecast to us billion  billionthe growth strategy also does not own any banks but does hold american express there are no australian stocks in the portfolio nor does it invest in apple the downside risk of apple is not knowableholding onto its amazon position which it started acquiring at around us a share in  its about whats to come thats the only thing that matters is whats ahead and what the opportunity is ms briggs saidrelentlessly visionary loomis sayles doesnt necessarily agree that share prices follow earnings focusing on cashflow returns on invested capitalif youre earning above your cost of capital youre creating shareholder value if youre earning less than youre eating up your capital you can have earnings growth but not be earning above your cost of capitalregarding the booming amazon web services or aws you might say its just luck because we certainly didnt know about it in  but you might attribute it to the type of management were looking for ms briggs said relentlessly visionarythe scale of amazon will have an impact on certain competitors as it builds a base in australia but not necessarily all of them she said ms briggs also recalled that in  about  per cent of amazons stock was targeted by short sellers everyone was thinking that they were just a bookseller they didnt have the vision that it was going to be able to expand into other categoriesloomis sayles and jeff bezos thought otherwise the market also responded negatively to amazons intention to make essential investments in its interfacesimilarly in its first year facebook had us million in mobilegenerated revenue that is now almost us billion they recovered quickly shall we saythe fund manager also owns mercadolibre an online marketplace that is the dominant player in many south american countries there are regional differences ms briggs said mercadolibre was winning market share even in brazil where the economy is severely challengedamazon spent  years in china and a lot of money and gained about  per cent market share it isnt a given that in every region theyre going to go in and own italibaba has managed to do something even amazon has not the big distinction for alibaba compared to say amazon in developed markets is that its creating new demandotherwise in the developed market online is a takeaway game in that it steals share from bricksandmortar retailersthe investment manager emphasises longterm investing it launched a global growth strategy at the start of  and has not bought or sold a single name outside of adding and trimming positionsoracle and cisco described as old tech have been in the portfolio
