agents during fitusiran administration   stability study results support a greater than two year product shelflife at room temperature storage conditions  cambridge massbusiness wire alnylam pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq alny the leading rnai therapeutics company today announced new results from an exploratory analysis of its phase  study with fitusiran an investigational rnai therapeutic in patients with hemophilia a or b with or without inhibitors this analysis of bleed management during fitusiran administration showed that breakthrough bleeds were effectively managed with replacement factors or bypassing agents with no thromboembolic events additionally results presented from stability studies of fitusiran support a greater than twoyear shelf life at room temperature storage conditions and demonstrated resistance to thermal stress favoring real world handling of the final drug product these data were presented at the th annual congress of the european association of haemophilia and allied disorders eahad held february     in paris france new analyses examined  total bleed events in  patients treated with fitusiran after achieving greater than  percent antithrombin lowering this analysis found that dosing of agents was generally within the normal dose range for replacement factor viii and factor ix as well as for the bypassing agent rfviia while at the lower end of the range for the bypassing agent apcc treatment of all breakthrough bleed events resulted in successful hemostasis without any thromboembolic events we are encouraged by this new analysis which provides evidence that breakthrough bleeds occurring in patients treated with fitusiran can be effectively managed with both replacement factor and bypassing agents with no thromboembolic events these data combined with positive recent clinical results continue to support the potential of fitusiran as a oncemonthly subcutaneous investigational medicine for the management of hemophilia said akin akinc phd vice president and general manager fitusiran furthermore data continue to support the robust stability profile of fitusiran potentially facilitating treatment in regions where cold chain storage requirements represent a challenge to patients access to effective therapies we continue to advance toward the start of our atlas phase  clinical program in early  an evaluation of fitusiran at refrigerated ie ºc customary room temperature ie ºc percent relative humidity and at accelerated aging conditions ie ºc demonstrated a robust stability profile with all key quality attributes predicted to be retained at both refrigerated and room temperature conditions for at least  months further fitusiran has shown resistance to thermal stress and cyclic temperature fluctuations that may occur during real world storage and handling of the drug product consequently the stability profile of fitusiran could enable convenient transportation and storage including in parts of the world where cold chain delivery is a challenge to view the fitusiran clinical results described in this press release please visit wwwalnylamcomcapella about fitusiran fitusiran is a subcutaneously administered investigational rnai therapeutic targeting antithrombin at for the treatment of hemophilia a and b and rare bleeding disorders rbd currently in early stage clinical development fitusiran is designed to lower levels of at with the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to restore hemostasis and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia and rbd at also known as antithrombin iii and serpinc is a liverexpressed plasma protein and member of the serpin family of proteins that acts by inactivating thrombin and other coagulation factors at plays a key role in normal hemostasis by helping to limit the process of fibrin clot formation however in hemophilia insufficient thrombin generation results in impaired fibrin clot formation lowering at in the hemophilia setting may promote the generation of sufficient levels of thrombin needed to form an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding this rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that coinheritance of thrombophilic mutations including at deficiency may ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia lowering of at is a unique and innovative strategy for restoring hemostasis in people with hemophilia fitusiran utilizes alnylams escgalnac conjugate technology which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a wide therapeutic index about fitusiran phase  study the ongoing phase  trial of fitusiran is being conducted in the united states bulgaria russia switzerland and the uk as a single and multidose doseescalation study comprised of four parts part a  which is complete  was a randomized singleblind placebocontrolled singledose doseescalation study n per cohort  randomization of fitusiranplacebo in healthy volunteers this part of the study was completed after the first dose cohort received a single subcutaneous dose of fitusiran at  mcgkg part b of the study  which is also complete  was an openlabel multidose doseescalation study that enrolled  patients with severe hemophilia a or b patients in part b received three weekly subcutaneous injections of fitusiran at doses of   or  mcgkg part c of the study  which has completed dosing  is an openlabel multidose dose escalation study that enrolled  patients with moderate or severe hemophilia a or b without inhibitors twelve patients in part c received three monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at doses of    or  mcgkg in addition six patients in part c received three fixed monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at  mg part d was designed to enroll up to  patients with inhibitors patients in part d received  fixed monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at  mg or  mg the primary objective of parts b c and d of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of subcutaneously administered fitusiran in patients with hemophilia with and without inhibitors secondary objectives include assessment of clinical activity as determined by lowering of circulating at levels and increase in thrombin generation at pharmacologic doses of fitusiran in addition exploratory analyses of bleeding are being performed in the uk enrollment has been aided by the southern academic coagulation consortium sacc sanofi genzyme alliance in january  alnylam and sanofi genzyme the specialty care global business unit of sanofi formed an alliance to accelerate and

discovery has been heralded as a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the  nobel prize for physiology or medicine rnai is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals by harnessing the natural biological process of rnai occurring in our cells the creation of a major new class of medicines known as rnai therapeutics is on the horizon small interfering rna sirna the molecules that

disease and interfere with its function thus remediating the disease at a molecular level examples include small molecule hiv protease inhibitors which are taken orally and via the bloodstream make their way to cells infected with the hiv virus and block a key enzyme virally encoded enzyme hiv protease by occupying its active site thereby refusing access of a key viral component and preventing a key step in the hiv virus life cycle scission of the hiv polyprotein a different approach targets the production of a protein required for the development of the disease rnai was discovered to be a natural mechanism for silencing genes through cleavage and degradation of mrna first discovered in c elegans in  by andrew fire and craig mello genes encode the information necessary for cells to synthesize proteins and proteins made abnormally cause many human diseases when a mutant gene is silenced the cell stops making the abnormal protein specified by that gene potentially improving the course of the disease in  alnylam founders began using small interfering rnas known as sirnas to silence genes by targeting mrna in mammalian cells productsedit in  alnylam pharmaceuticals had

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the
