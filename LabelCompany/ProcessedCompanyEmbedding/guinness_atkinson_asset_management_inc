there a redemption fee a  the guinness atkinson funds are meant for longterm investors the redemption fee  for  days is meant to both discourage active trading in the guinness atkinson funds and to compensate the remaining investors for activity based charges incurred by the fund q  what do you mean by human progress and why is it important to investing a  we believe that it is difficult to invest successfully without a view regarding the direction we are heading and by “we” we mean the entire world there are a handful of very important longterm secular trends underway that are quite clearly reshaping the planet  these changes have political social cultural economic and importantly for us investment implications  the breakneck speed of business and innovation the dramatic and stunning rise of china and asia the increasing demands for energy on a global scale and the inexorable shift to alternative energy are just some of the forces that are profoundly reshaping the world around us we’re not sure how—or why—one would invest without thinking about these broad themes and factoring the implications of this change into their thinking further while we understand that rapid change can be unsettling the hidden truth in these changes is that the human condition continues to improve yes we know the news media sometimes offers a steady drumbeat of negative news and we acknowledge that there are some very serious issues confronting us  we also acknowledge that for a large portion of the world life is nothing short of terrible we’ve always had serious problems to tackle and there has always been a large portion of the world for which life is extreme  yet despite the negative drumbeat the human condition continues to improve  how do we know almost any measure of the human condition is on an upward arc  infant mortality rates life expectancy leisure time per capita gdp literacy access to education information and health care and a host of other key metrics have never been as high as now  quite frankly there has never been a better time to be a human q  how do you keep investors up to date a  in addition to this website we offer an email program featuring a series of monthly ebriefs produced by our asset management team  we offer the following ebriefs energy brief asia brief alternative energy brief and the dividend brief  these ebriefs are designed to provide our most current thinking about the broad themes as well as the current outlook and update on the holdings within the funds  we maintain an archive of these ebriefs so that readers

one email per month  we generally send one or two additional emails per year  and of course we don’t share our email list with anyone q  what if i have a question that isn’t covered here a  feel free to send an email to email protected we like hearing from investors and welcome the opportunity to address any inquiries q  i see you have an alternative energy fund  who do i speak with if i have an alternative energy project that needs funding a  the guinness atkinson funds invest in publicly traded companies  we are not in a position to provide funding for projects startups or other nonpublicly traded investment vehicles if your company is a publicly traded alternative energy company then it is almost certainly already known to our investment management team  if it is a project or venture

do this he’d be a tugboat operator he does not elaborate on that point having spent more than  years in the world of finance and management jim exhibits a level of passion and motivation that we can only describe as “jim atkinsonlike” his level of expertise is rivaled only by his drive to expand his understanding of the global community we estimate that he will tire of this as soon as he knows everything there is to know in the universe as a founder of guinness atkinson funds jim has been instrumental in developing the company’s philosophy and in identifying the core fund themes of human

investors should be willing and able to assume the risks of equity investing investment in the funds carries with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing the value of the funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each fund invests past performance is not a guide to future performance performance risks we identify the following performance risks in our funds market risk the value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency the fund’s base currency usd and the currency of the fund share class you own emerging market risk the risk inherent in a fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’ these funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in emerging market investment there are other risks of investing in our funds such as credit and counterparty risks which are detailed in the prospectus shareholders in guinness global equity income fund and guinness global money managers fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the funds charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment fund specific risks in addition some funds carry their own specific risks sector risk some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness alternative energy fund guinness global energy fund guinness global money managers fund geographic risk some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness china  hong kong fund for more detail on the risks relating to specific products please refer to the relevant documentation for that product guinness eis service an enterprise investment scheme eis is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller higherrisk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should consider
