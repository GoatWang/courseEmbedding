corporations partnerships partnership basics partnership basics learn more about the simplest business structure for companies with more than one owner by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or llc limited liability company there are two basic types of partnerships  general partnerships and limited partnerships the general partnership is the simplest and least expensive coowned business structure to create and maintain however there are a few important facts you should know about the personal liability of general partners by definition a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or llc limited liability company there are two basic types of partnerships general partnerships and limited partnerships this article discusses general partnerships the more common structure in which every partner has a hand in managing the business the partnership is the simplest and least expensive coowned business structure to create and maintain however there are a few important facts you should know before you begin personal liability for all owners first partners are personally liable for all business debts and obligations including court judgments this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor such as a supplier lender or landlord the creditor can legally come after any partners house car or other possessions there are a few exceptions to this personal liability some of the partners can have limited personal liability if the partnership is set up as a limited partnership this is a partnership in which only the general partner who runs the business has personal liability while the limited partners who are basically passive investors can lose no more than their stake in the partnership also some states allow special limited liability partnerships llps more commonly though businesspeople who are particularly concerned about personal liability choose to incorporate their business or operate as a limited liability company llc for more information see nolos articles on corporations  and  limited liability companies joint authority in addition any individual partner can usually bind the whole business to a contract or other business deal for instance if your partner signs a yearlong contract with a supplier to buy inventory at a price your business cant afford you can be held personally responsible for the money owed under the contract there are just a few limits on a partners ability to commit the partnership to a deal  for instance one partner cant bind the partnership to a sale of all of the partnerships assets but generally unless an outsider has reason to know of any limits the partners have placed on each others authority in their partnership agreement any partner can bind the others to a deal joint liability each individual partner can be sued for  and required to pay  the full amount of any business debt if this happens an individual partners only recourse may be to sue the other partners for their shares of the debt because of this combination of personal liability for all partnership debt and the authority of each partner to bind the partnership its critical that you trust the people with whom you start your business partnership taxes a partnership is not a separate tax entity from its owners instead its what the irs calls a passthrough entity this means the partnership itself does not pay any income taxes on profits business income simply passes through the business to the partners who report their share of profits or losses on their individual income tax returns in addition each partner must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs each year while the partnership itself doesnt pay taxes it must file irs form  an informational return each year this form sets out each partners share of the partnership profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure the partners are reporting their income correctly for more information on reporting and paying partnership taxes see how partnerships are taxed creating a partnership you dont have to file any paperwork to establish an ordinary partnership  just agreeing to go into business with another person will get you started of course partnerships must  meet the same local registration requirements as any new business most cities and counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax you may also have to obtain an employer identification number from the irs a sellers license from your state and a zoning permit from your local planning board in addition your partnership may have to register a fictitious or assumed business name if your business name doesnt contain all of the partners last names for instance you want to use london landscapes instead of harper  reed landscapes you usually must register that name  known as a fictitious or assumed business name  with your county clerk for more information on fictitious business names see registering your business name while the owners of a partnership are not legally required to have a written partnership agreement it makes good sense to put the details of ownership including the partners rights and responsibilities and their share of profits into a written agreement for more about why partnership agreements are so important read creating a partnership agreement ending a partnership one disadvantage of partnerships is that when one partner wants to leave the company the partnership generally dissolves in that case the partners must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts and divide any assets and profits among themselves if you want to prevent this kind of ending for your business you should create a buysell agreement or buyout agreement which can be included as part of your partnership agreement a buysellbuyout agreement helps partners decide and plan for what will happen when one partner retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the partnership to pursue other interests for example such an agreement might allow the partners to buy out a departing partners interest so business can continue as usual for more information see plan ahead for changes

partnership  wikipedia strategic partnership from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a strategic partnership also see strategic alliance is a relationship between two commercial enterprises usually formalized by one or more business contracts a strategic partnership will usually fall short of a legal partnership entity agency or corporate affiliate relationship strategic partnerships can take on various forms from shake hand agreements contractual cooperations all the way to equity alliances either the formation of a joint venture or crossholdings in each other typically two companies form a strategic partnership when each possesses one or more business assets or have expertise that will help the other by enhancing their businesses strategic partnerships can develop in outsourcing relationships where the parties desire to achieve longterm “winwin” benefits and innovation based on mutually desired outcomes one common strategic partnership involves one company providing engineering manufacturing or product development services partnering with a smaller entrepreneurial firm or inventor to create a specialized new product typically the larger firm supplies capital and the necessary product development marketing manufacturing and distribution capabilities while the smaller firm supplies specialized technical or creative expertise another common strategic partnership involves a suppliermanufacturer partnering with a distributor or wholesale consumer rather than approach the transactions between the companies as a simple link in the product or service supply chain the two companies form a closer relationship where they mutually participate in advertising marketing branding product development and other business functions as examples an automotive manufacturer may form strategic partnerships with its parts suppliers or a music distributor with record labels strategic partnerships also have emerged to solve many company business

formation llcs  corporations partnerships creating a partnership agreement put the terms of your partnership in writing to protect your business by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook if you and your partners dont spell out your rights and responsibilities in a written partnership agreement youll be illequipped to settle conflicts when they arise and minor misunderstandings may erupt into fullblown disputes in addition without a written agreement saying otherwise your states laws will control many aspects of your business how a partnership agreement helps your business a partnership agreement allows you to structure your relationship with your partners in a way that suits your business you and your partners can establish the shares of profits or losses each partner will take the responsibilities of each partner what will happen to the business if a partner leaves and other important guidelines the uniform partnership act each state with the exception of louisiana has its own laws governing partnerships contained in whats usually called the uniform partnership act or the revised uniform partnership act or the upa or revised upa these statutes establish the basic legal rules that apply to partnerships and will control many aspects of your partnerships life unless you set out different rules in a written partnership agreement to find your states partnership statutes see nolos state law resources legal research page dont be tempted to leave the terms of your partnership up to these state laws because they were designed as onesizefitsall fallback rules they may not be helpful in your particular situation its much better to have an agreement in which you and your partners state the rules that will apply to your business what to include in your partnership agreement heres a list of the major areas that most partnership agreements cover you and your partnerstobe should consider these issues before you put the terms in writing name of the partnership one of the first things you must do is agree on a name for your partnership you can use your own last names such as smith  wesson or you can adopt and register a fictitious business name such as westside home repairs if you choose a fictitious name you must make sure that the name isnt already in use and then file a fictitious business name statement with your county clerk for more information see nolos article registering your business name contributions to the partnership its critical that you and your partners work out and record whos going to contribute cash property or services to the business before it opens  and what ownership percentage each partner will have disagreements over contributions have doomed many promising businesses allocation of profits losses and draws will profits and losses be allocated in proportion to a partners percentage interest in the business will each partner be entitled to a regular draw a withdrawal of allocated profits from the business or will all profits be distributed at the end of each year you and your partners may have different financial needs and different ideas about how the money should be divided up and distributed so this is an area to which you should pay particular attention partners authority without an agreement to the contrary any partner can bind the partnership to a contract or debt for example without the consent of the other partners if you want one or all of the partners to obtain the others consent before obligating the partnership you must make this clear in your partnership agreement partnership decision making although theres no magic formula or language for making decisions among partners youll head off a lot of trouble if you try to work it out beforehand you may for example want to require a unanimous vote of all the partners for every business decision or if that leaves you feeling fettered you can require a unanimous vote for major decisions and allow individual partners to make minor decisions on their own in that case your partnership agreement will have to describe what constitutes a major or minor decision you should carefully think through issues like these before you and your partners have to make important decisions management duties you might not want to make ironclad rules about every management detail but youd be wise to work out some guidelines in advance for example who will keep the books who will deal with customers supervise employees negotiate with suppliers think through the management needs of your partnership and be sure youve got everything covered admitting new partners eventually you may want to expand the business and bring in new partners agreeing on a procedure for admitting new partners will make your lives a lot easier when this issue comes up withdrawal or death of a partner at least as important as the rules for admitting new partners to the business are the rules for handling the departure of an owner you should set up a reasonable buyout scheme in your partnership agreement to learn more about this issue read nolos article plan ahead for changes in partnership ownership resolving disputes if you and your partners become deadlocked on an issue do you want to go straight to court it might benefit everyone involved if your partnership agreement provides for alternative dispute resolution such as mediation or arbitration next steps as you can see there are many issues to consider before you and your partners open for business  and you shouldnt wait for a conflict to arise before

responsible for those areas workload how will the workload be shared  answer the following questions are partners expected to work set hours does one partner plan on working more or less than the other partners if so you may want to adjust division of ownership and profits accordingly see compensation section below how much vacation is allowed will this be a full time role for each partner or are partners allowed to conduct other types of businesses outside of the partnership if partners are given more flexibility there should be a provision specifying that other ventures cannot compete with the business contributions next you want to determine what each partner is bringing to the business in terms of cash investment physical property equipment office space etc and intellectualother types of property software code client lists etc once you have listed everything out you should outline how that property will be owned and used here are some examples personal property example you are starting a landscaping business and one of the partners contributes a lawnmower does that mower become the property of the business client list example you are starting brokerage firm and one of the partners brings clients with them from a previous job  does   of the revenue from those clients flow into the business intellectual property example you and your partners launch an online business and one partner contributes software code  is that code now owned by the business can other partners modify it ownership split now that you have decided on responsibilities workload and which partners are contributing what to the business you can come to an agreement on how ownership is going to be shared in the business   a  ownership as dan shapiro explains further in this post is not always the way to go if a partner is doing any of the following that typically merits their getting a larger ownership share in the business one partner has contributed to a significantly larger amount of property to the business the partner thought of the original business concept andor developed a beta product secured a patent or completed another critical first step working full time while other partners are working part time the partner has successfully raised venture capital funding compensationdistributions of profits and losses partners are not paid salaries they receive distributions from the profits of the business if there are no profits says michael boutros a lawyer and partner at krevolin  horst llc then there are generally no distributions an exception to this is something called “guaranteed payments” which is compensation that’s paid and guaranteed to a partner without regard to the profits and losses of a partnership this is like a taking a salary the irs has certain rules and restrictions regarding the payment and treatment of guaranteed payments say boutros so small business owners should consult with a lawyer and tax professional this section should answer the following questions do you plan on reinvesting profits back into the business at what point do you plan on taking out profits and distributing them to the partners how and when will profits and losses be divided up amongst the owners  often it’s based on contributions and ownership for example someone who contributes 0  of the property to a business will typically own 0  of the business and receive 0  of the profitslosses however the setup may be different for your business if for instance one partner works a lot more than others or has more responsibilities will you offer guaranteed payments if so to whom when and how much partner disputes being able to discuss and come to an agreement on differences of opinion is a must for any business to move forward and grow most of the time collaboration on day to day issues happens seamlessly however disputes are inevitable and when the contested issues affect the future of the business the agreement should lay out a method for resolution one common mistake small businesses make says boutros is to give each owner an equal say in the business without including a tie breaker boutros explains “when two  partners inevitably develop diverging views on a major company decision–whether to purchase a new building or to invest in a new international division–the company reaches an impasse that impedes its longterm viability” here are some better ways to handle partner disputes the ceo has the final say one partner has the final say on a particular part of the business  for example on hiring and firing disputes it may be the ceo for product development disputes the partner who is in charge of product may have the final say vote based on ownership for instance someone owning 0  of the business would have more of a say than someone owning 0  of the business majority vote for businesses with an odd number of partners partners agree to use an outside mentor to resolve disputes partners agree to use an outside advisory board other more formal options are mediation – working with a professional mediator can help partners come to an agreement on issues that they were not able to resolve alone  for more on this option see this article arbitration – if you are not able to come to an agreement through mediation then arbitration which binds the partners to the decision made by the arbitrator is the next option before going to court  for more on this option see this article litigation – if things become too contentious and the business is not able to move forward you can sue your business partner this is usually a long and expensive process however and one that will probably sour your relationship with the partner forever business authority this section should answer the following questions contracts does each partner have the authority to sign contracts on behalf of the business if so those contracts will bind all partners debt is the business going to have a credit card credit line a loan  keep in mind here that depending on the business structure that you choose each partner may be personally liable for this spending does a partner have the ability to make purchases without consulting the other partners  generally there is a limit that is set in the agreement above which point the partner must obtain permission from the other partners partner deathdisability what happens if a partner dies or becomes unable to participate at the same level because of a disability  most business owners probably do not want their deceased partner’s heirs to be their new business partners to prevent these types of issues a buy sell agreement will be included in most business partnership agreements a buy sell agreement allows remaining partners to buy out the partner who is disabled or who passed away buy sell agreements also usually cover partner divorces to prevent a divorcee’s exspouse from becoming a business partner  you should also look into key person insurance aka key man insurance this type of insurance enables the business to survive the loss of a key person the insurance company will pay out a benefit to the business in case an owner or key executive passes away or becomes disabled partner exit answer the following questions voluntary exit what happens if a partner wants to leave the partnership and pursue other interests this is usually covered by a buy sell agreement involuntary exit under what circumstances can a partner be forced to leave the business new partners what is the process for deciding on bringing in a new partner  majority vote  some other method  here is a great article on the topic from attorney matt dickstein selling the business under what circumstances can the business be sold  this likely goes back to the buy sell agreement bottom line creating a business partnership agreement is a necessity for a small business with multiple owners the agreement will cover the good times and bad times in your business it covers how the business will be managed how profits will be divided and how disputes will be resolved with a good partnership agreement under your belt you can focus on running and growing your business get free template

going into business with a friend or several friends you’re joining in a basic american dream—running your own show being your own boss and hopefully gaining some control over your economic destiny before you take the plunge however you should take a step back and consider whether forming a partnership makes sense we mean this in two ways first are you ready to start a shared business of any kind while there are great benefits to shared ownership it can also create stress—and it will definitely require you to work very closely with your coowners before you get started it makes good sense to take a very close look at your own willingness to be that intimately involved with your prospective partners second if you decide that you want to start a sharedownership business what legal form should that business take a partnership is only one of several ways you can structure a sharedownership business before you invest the time and energy drafting a partnership agreement you should carefully consider whether another ownership structure—such as a corporation or a limited liability company—might better suit your business this chapter will help you answer both questions if you decide after careful consideration that forming a partnership is the best way to realize your business and personal goals the rest of this book will help you draft a partnership agreement that will serve your business well for years to come    get updates forms and more at nolocom you can download any of the forms in this book at wwwnolocombackofbookparthtml when there are important changes to the information in this book we’ll post updates on this same dedicated page you’ll find other useful information there too including blogs podcasts and videos   sharing ownership of a business the advantages of having one or more coowners can be tremendous but so can the headaches of trying to make group decisions agree on business goals run your company together and distribute the work profits and debt fairly whether shared ownership is right for you depends both on your own personality and on the partners you’ve chosen   advantages and drawbacks shared ownership has many benefits the chemistry and spirit of two three or more minds working together can often produce ­exciting results there’s more energy and enthusiasm and—at least as important—more cash skills and resources and it’s a lot easier to arrange for time off if you have partners than if you’re trying to run a business all by yourself but for all of those who dream of doing their own thing—and who hasn’t—only a relatively small number will be committed or nutty enough to invest the love and labor necessary to get a small business off the ground those who do will almost inevitably go through periods of stress and their survival will depend on their ability to quickly and competently master all sorts of unfamiliar skills and tasks in a partnership business there are also the stresses and risks that can come with shared ownership money can be incendiary stuff before you decide to throw in your financial lot with others you need to make sure you’re willing and able to become involved that intimately with each other  in a shared business your coowners will make decisions that directly affect your life of course there are steps you can take to put some limits on this such as requiring decisions to be made by the whole group or limiting the authority of one owner to act for others but ultimately sharing a business requires you to give up some control shared ownership allows you to share the burdens of your business but it also requires you to share the responsibilities if that doesn’t sound like you a sharedownership business probably isn’t the right call   choosing the right partners the most important assets of any shared business are the coowners’ competence determination to work hard and the trust they have in one another of course your business partners must share your dream but they must also be willing to share the work of course you and your partners should get along well personally but that’s not enough you must also have compatible work styles have similar expectations about how much each of you will do for the business and have the same goals for your business’s future partnerships are very human enterprises while we can’t tell you exactly who you should pick as a partner we can tell you that not every friendship—or every romantic relationship—makes a good business partnership our experience has taught us that there are a few questions prospective partners should consider before throwing in their lot with one another • do you all understand and agree that you’re going to run a business with the aim of making a decent profit any moneymaking enterprise qualifies as a business if any wouldbe partners are nonbusiness types who simply aren’t comfortable with that you and they don’t want to be part of the same partnership • how long have you known each other we’ve seen some new friendships crumble under the stress of running a business together don’t enter any partnership casually • are all prospective partners roughly on the same economic footing if not how do you feel about the possibility that some partners’ decisions may be based not on the business’s economic realities but on their own outside financial resources or needs • how’s your chemistry there are no rules at all here sometimes people with different temperaments work out very well as partners and sometimes people who are longtime friends with very similar personalities can’t develop a harmonious business relationship probably the best you can do is ask yourself whether you can imagine being in a close business relationship with your prospective partners ten or more years from now if you can’t think twice about going forward   a personal note if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed about starting a shared business you’re certainly not alone but we’re confident that you’ll find—as we have—that along with the hard work and unavoidable stresses of running a shared business there’s a lot of excitement and freedom as well both of us grew up on the east coast went off to college and emerged like so many others unsure about “what we wanted to do” we considered lots of choices both of us drifted to law school with the vague hope that the law would give us some skills useful in making the world a better place how we each became disillusioned with that dream is another story the point here is that through all of our dreaming and planning neither of us ever imagined that we’d wind up as proprietors of small businesses fullfledged members of the “free enterprise system” but that’s what happened we’ve experienced both great ­satisfaction and some very real pain in running our own shops we’ve been through our complete ­beginner stage and have made most of the routine mistakes as well as pioneering some lulus somehow we’ve survived it all to realize that doing our own thing at nolo gives us a sense of freedom and selfworth at the same time that we make a good living—a combination that’s hard to match in this increasingly bureaucratized world we know we are not alone in finding a measure of satisfaction in jointly participating in a small business in the process of putting this book together we talked to many people who have successfully created their own small business partnerships we’ve been told time and again about the satisfaction and even joy derived from providing a product or service that genuinely interests the provider and benefits the consumer we’ve also learned a lot about how people relate to—and may even gain some satis­faction from—the tough competition that’s so much a part of the world of small business where survival depends on your ability to offer something that people really want and need and most of all we’ve been reminded constantly that although money is important it’s not usually the primary ­reason people organize their own businesses it’s gratifying to talk with partners more concerned with the quality of work and a sensible life than the top dollar happily we’ve found that integrity and ­creativity—even altruism—are alive and well in small business america   business structure options there are five common legal forms of business ownership • partnership • sole proprietorship • corporation • limited liability company and • limited partnership some states have distinct subcategories of these five especially partnerships for example there’s a creature called a “mining partnership” used for mining and oil ventures in some states in this chapter we’ll just concern ourselves with the basic forms to help you choose the business structure that best suits your needs this chapter explains the legal and practical consequences of each option of course our emphasis is on the partnership form but don’t assume that it must be the right one for you without exploring your alternatives we’ve received letters from readers of earlier editions telling us that after reading these materials they decided to form a small corporation or a sole proprietorship that’s great the time to consider your options is here at the start once you’ve created your legal form it takes some time and trouble to change it   partnerships in this section we give you a quick look at the nature of partnerships so that you can compare them to corporations limited liability companies and sole proprietorships later in this chapter we’ll explore the partnership legal form in more depth here are five key points about partnerships  a partnership is a business owned by two or more people  each partner can perform all acts that are necessary to operate the business including hiring employees and spending or borrowing money however you can put some limits on a partner’s authority as explained in “a closer look at partnerships” below each partner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business this is a vital reason why your partners must be trustworthy if a creditor has a claim against your partnership and the partnership doesn’t have enough assets to satisfy that claim the personal assets of any partner can be taken to pay the business debts  partners share in profits or losses in whatever proportion they’ve agreed on partnerships themselves don’t pay taxes although they do file an annual tax form the partners report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns as part of their regular income  partnerships begin when two or more people form a business although technically a part­nership ends if one partner leaves you can agree at the beginning that the partnership business will continue to be run by the remaining partners if there are any if you want the business to continue after a partner leaves—and almost all partnerships work this way—you’ll need to work out what will happen to the interest of the departing partner who can or must buy that interest how will you determine a fair price for that interest see chapter   the owners normally have a written partnership agreement specifying their respective rights and responsibilities the purpose of this agreement is to cover all major issues that may affect the partnership from the manner of dividing profits and losses to management of the business to buyout provisions in case a partner leaves or dies this agreement does not have to be filed with any government agency and no official approval is required to start the partnership there are different rules for limited partnerships see chapter    history lesson  partnerships date to the beginning of recorded history references are made to partnerships in the babylonian code of hammurabi approximately  bc the jews around  bc a pastoral not a commercial people evolved a form of landsharing or grazing partnership called a “shutolin” later commercial jewish partnerships evolved from trading caravans   the sole proprietorship a sole proprietor means as the words say that there’s one owner of the business the owner may hire and fire employees the owner may even arrange for employees to receive a percentage of the business profits as part of their wages but he or she remains the sole owner the owner—and the owner alone—is personally liable for all the debts taxes and liabilities of the business including claims made against employees acting in the course and scope of their employment the business does not pay taxes as an entity instead the owner reports and pays taxes on the profits of the business on his or her own individual income tax returns   resource want more information on setting up and running a sole proprietorship take a look at the small business startup kit by peri pakroo and legal guide for starting  running a small business by fred s steingold both by nolo   personality traits and the sole proprietorship quite simply the main advantage of a sole proprietorship is that there is only one boss you so potential managerial conflicts are eliminated except for your inner ones the disadvantages stem from the source—there is only you as owner and boss if you get sick want time off or simply want to share the responsibility of decision making with someone else you won’t have a lot of flexibility whether you should be the only boss is often a question of temperament some people like and need to run the whole show and always chafe in a shared ownership situation while others want need or at least appreciate the resources and strengths from cash to camaraderie that coowners can bring the best advice we can give you here is that old axiom—know thyself   sole proprietorship compared with shared ownership in deciding whether to operate a business as a sole proprietorship or adopt a form of shared ownership such as a partnership a business organizer may be inclined to choose shared ownership to involve key employees in the future of the business while it may make great sense to allow important employees to become coowners either as partners or stockholders this is not the only way to reward dedicated and talented employees a profitsharing agreement within the framework of the sole proprietorship may be a good alternative approach at least until you see if you and the key employees are compatible over the long term   example  eric is a selfemployed architect he gets a big job and advertises for help soon hiring frank and samantha to assist with the drafting halfway through the new job things are working so well that eric decides to bid on an even larger job he knows that to complete this new job successfully he’ll have to depend a great deal on his two assistants eric first considers making frank and samantha junior partners however because he has only known them for a few months and because samantha is pondering moving to the other side of the country eric decides that it makes more sense to put off the partnership decision and offer each  of his profit on the deal over and above their regular salary   example  susan decides to open a sandwich shop near a busy college campus she wants her friend ellen to work with real enthusiasm but because money is short can only pay her a modest salary to start to ensure ellen’s continued dedication susan offers her a bonus of a profitsharing agreement under which ellen gets  of all net profits   terminating a sole proprietorship when the owner dies a sole proprietorship ends by contrast in theory at least a partnership a small corporation or a limited liability company can continue under the direction of the surviving owners practically however a sole proprietor who wants his or her business to continue after its owner dies can leave the remaining assets after paying off its debts of course to someone who will continue its operations   caution sole proprietors need to plan for probate if the owner of a sole proprietorship leaves business assets through the owner’s will the probate process can take up to a year and make it difficult for the inheritors to either operate or sell the business or any of its assets to avoid this small business owners should consider transferring the business into a living trust a legal device which avoids probate and allows the assets to be transferred to the inheritors promptly for more information on creating a living trust for a business see plan your estate by denis clifford nolo   corporations a corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners who are its shareholders traditionally the chief attraction of running a small business as a corporation is that the shareholder owners enjoy limited personal liability for business debts or obligations ordinarily each shareholder stands to lose only what he or she has invested in the corporation other assets such as the owners’ houses and investments can’t be grabbed to pay business debts because of the development of the limited liability company llc discussed below the corporate form of ownership has lost much of its appeal for shared owners of a small business limited liability companies also offer owners limited personal liability but avoid some of the drawbacks of organizing either as a partnership or a corporation we examine those drawbacks below here we’ll take a brief closer look at how the corporate form works in theory a corporation involves three groups those who direct the business directors those who run the business officers and those who invest in it shareholders in the case of a small business corporation these three groups are often one and the same person indeed oneperson corporations are legal and common in many states a corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with the appropriate state agency usually the secretary or department of state once this is done the corporation comes into legal existence the directors are responsible for the overall supervision of the business the officers president or chief executive officer ceo vice president treasurer and secretary are in charge of the daytoday operation of the business the shareholders are the owners who have invested in the business by buying stock the directors normally adopt corporate bylaws which cover the basic rules of how the business will actually operate practically speaking for a small business bylaws can serve the same purpose as a partnership agreement however many shareholders of small corporations also enter into a shareholders’ agreement which usually spells out the circumstances under which a shareholder may sell his or her stock and describes what happens to a shareholder’s shares if he or she dies becomes disabled gets divorced or retires unlike partnerships sole proprietorships and llcs corporations must also hold formal director and shareholder meetings and document major corporate decisions in corporate minutes if corporations don’t hold these meetings or prepare records of these corporate decisions the owners risk losing their limited liability corporations are taxed first at the business entity level and then again when corporate owners pay personal income tax on corporate profits distributed to them but this double taxation can be minimized or avoided if the owners pay out profits to themselves as taxdeductible salaries and benefits corporations have emerged in the last  years as the major organizational form through which largescale international capitalism does business because corporations seem to be such a grownup bigtime way of doing business some people starting a small business are convinced that they too need a corporation—or at least that there must be great advantages to doing business in corporate form as we discuss below however for many new owners of small businesses immediately forming a corporation isn’t necessary usually the corporate form of doing business provides no real advantage over a partnership or limited liability company and sometimes can be disadvantageous and remember whichever legal ownership form you decide upon you’ll have to resolve the same basic issues regarding power between the owners   the limited liability company there’s a relatively new legal entity in the business world called a limited liability company llc llcs are available in every state and they can be structured as multi or single member entities so even sole proprietors can choose to organize as an llc the llc attempts to blend many of the benefits of a partnership and a corporation the business can choose to be treated as a partnership taxwise which means all profits are taxed at the individual level rather than the business level but llcs also permit owners to obtain a key attraction of a corporation—limited liability an llc owner’s personal assets cannot be taken to pay business debts and llcs are generally not required to observe the same formalities as a corporation—they don’t have to elect directors hold annual shareholders meetings or even prepare formal minutes of meetings or business decisions unless they agree to do so in writing to form an llc the owners prepare articles of organization a document quite similar in form and content to corporate articles of incorporation articles of organization include basic facts such as the llc name principal office address agent and office for receiving legal papers and the names of the initial owners an llc’s articles of organization must be filed with the appropriate state agency usually the department or secretary of state’s office in some states you must also pay a fee which can range from about  to as much as  depending on the state in california for example a new llc pays a filing fee of 0 but must also pay a minimum of  annually most states require an llc to file an annual form or report this is in addition to staterequired llc income tax returns discussed below further a number of states impose annual fees on llcs and a few impose annual franchise taxes like a partnership an llc also should have a written agreement called an “operating agreement” which defines the basic rights and responsibilities of the llc owners to prepare a sound operating agreement llc owners must deal with the same issues as partners preparing a partnership agreement including how much capital each member will contribute to get the business going how much each person will work for the business to whom departing members can sell their share of the business and how that share is to be valued   resource if you want to create a limited liability company you can form your llc online with nolo’s online llc available at wwwnolocom or you can find all the forms and information you need to create your own llc in form your own limited liability company by anthony mancuso nolo   like shareholders of a corporation the owners of an llc generally are not liable for company debts beyond the amount each has invested in the company however unlike a corporation an llc is not subject to income tax as a business entity unless its owners choose to be taxed this way usually owners choose to be treated like a partnership for tax purposes with llc profits “flowing through” to the owners meaning that any profits the business earns are subject to federal income tax only on the owner’s personal tax return for most small businesses organized as llcs the owners are also the managers of the business however an llc can also be used as a type of investment device in which many or even most owners do not take an active role in business management but instead are passive investors the business is run by a small group of the owners called a “management group” or “board of managers” this use of the llc form is similar to a limited partnership discussed in chapter  in this type of llc the managerowners must comply with federal and state securities laws when selling interests in the llc to passive investors to be sure you know how to comply with the securities laws you must do careful legal research yourself or see a securities lawyer     business structures for professionals         some professions are regulated by state law and cannot use simple ordinary partnerships for example under almost all states’ laws doctors cannot form a general partnership other health care professionals—dentists nurses opticians optometrists pharmacists and physical therapists —are similarly regulated so are some other professions normally including psychologists accountants engineers and veterinarians the scope and details of regulation vary from state to state however laws in every state permit shared owner­ship by regulated professionals using different business structures they can form a “professional corporation” or a “professional service corporation” and in some states a “professional limited liability company” also in some states certain types of partnerships are allowed sometimes called “limited liability partnerships” if you are in a regulated profession see a lawyer whatever legal form a shared professional busi­ness takes the owners must resolve the same basic questions that are involved in setting up a partner­­ship who contributes what how work is allocated how profits are shared and what happens if an owner leaves though you’ll eventually need a lawyer to prepare the formal ownership documents you’ll benefit by working through these issues yourselves before seeking legal help   converting a partnership to an llc it’s fully legal to change the structure of a business from a partnership to an llc at any time essentially the llc articles of organization that you must create and file to convert a partnership are the same as those required to create an llc from scratch the partnership agreement perhaps with minor technical modifications can be renamed the llc operating agreement once a partnership has been converted into an llc the owners have limited liability for all future business debts and obligations the creation of the llc does not however wipe out the owners’ the former partners’ responsibility for any previous partnership debts or obligations   limited partnerships a limited partnership is a special kind of legal animal that in some circumstances combines the best attributes of a partnership and a corporation its advantage as a business structure is that it provides a way for business owners to raise money without having to give up managerial control or go to the trouble of creating a corporation and issuing stock you’ll find more detailed information on limited partnerships in chapter  a limited partnership must have at least one “general partner” the person or entity that really runs things the general partner can be another partnership an llc a corporation or a human being there can also be more than one general partner however many there are each general partner has the rights and potential liabilities normally involved in any partnership—such as management powers for the business and personal liability for business losses or debts limited partners on the other hand have no management powers but neither are they personally liable for the debts of the partnership limited partners are basically investors the return they receive for their investment is defined in the partnership agreement if the business fails the most that the limited partners can lose is what they invested in the business   example anthony and janice plan to purchase rundown houses renovate them then hopefully sell them at a good profit all they lack is the cash to make the initial purchases to solve this minor difficulty they first create a general partnership between themselves then they establish a limited partnership with their own partnership as the general partner and seek others who are willing to put up money for a defined interest in the venture janice and anthony decide that they need  to get started and they manage to sell ten limited partnership interests for 0 each sometimes limited partners receive a fixed return on their investment for instance they might receive “0 interest annually with principal to be repaid in three installments over seven years” investing in a limited partnership like this is similar to making a loan except it doesn’t remain an obligation if the partnership business fails limited partners aren’t liable for the business’s debts but they risk losing their entire investment if the partnership goes belly up more commonly instead of a fixed return limited partners receive a percentage of the profits assuming the venture makes money for a specific period of months or years or even forever limited partnerships can also be a useful means for expanding an existing business to raise money especially at times when other sources of cash are tight and interest rates are high   example judith and aretha have a small picture frame shop that has just begun to prosper after a couple of years on short rations believing that the time is now right to expand the two women spot a much larger store in a much better location which will allow them to stock a large selection of fine art prints as well as frames unfortunately they don’t have the money they need to finance the move and the larger inventory that it will entail to solve this problem they create a limited partnership offering a 0 investor an  interest in the total net profits of the store for the next three years as well as the return of the invested capital at the end of that period they sell four of their limited partnerships raising 0 as judith and aretha’s original partnership agreement didn’t provide for limited partners they must rewrite it and create a separate limited partnership agreement   caution limited partnership interests are securities offering and selling limited partnership interests involves the sale of what’s called a “security” the most common example of a security is a corporate stock or bond you must comply with all federal and state securities laws when you offer any limited partnership interest for sale see chapter  for more information   legal formalities of limited partnerships limited partnerships involve many more legal formalities than general partnerships in addition to securities laws limited partnerships are generally subject to other state controls setting up and operating a limited partnership is similar in many ways to the process of organizing and operating a small corporation state law usually requires that a registration certificate be filed with a government agency the information required on this document varies depending on state law often partnership and limited partnership agreements must be disclosed and the names and addresses of all partners and limited partners listed failure to comply with state registration requirements can subject the partnership to serious penalties and cause wouldbe limited partners to lose their limited liability status fortunately it’s not that difficult to comply with the registration requirements thousands and thousands of limited partnerships are formed each year also every state except louisiana has adopted the uniform limited partnership act which standardizes both the law and the registration procedures many states have adopted the revised uniform partnership act of  which further streamlines the law in this area restrictions on limited partnerships state law normally imposes restrictions on the availability and use of limited partnership names “limited” or “ltd” at the end of a business or partnership name does not automatically mean the entity is a limited partnership—these terms are simply the british equivalent of “incorporated” and “inc” some us companies include these british terms in their name because they believe it sounds aristocratic in addition these laws govern the manner of calling and holding meetings and may impose many other legal requirements which apply to the operation of the limited partnership unless alternative rules are clearly spelled out in the partnership agreement   history lesson  in europe as in england partnership law evolved from the customs of merchants so european civil law regarding partnerships is similar to ours civil law recognizes a “societas” the equivalent of our general partnership and a “societe en common dite” the equivalent of our limited partnership   comparing partnerships to llcs and corporations no matter which legal form you and your coowners choose you must confront and resolve the same daytoday problems such as allocating shares of ownership operating the business paying salaries and profits and resolving disputes among others because there are fewer legal formalities to comply with business owners who form partnerships have more time to focus on questions of their relationship with each other by contrast when creating an llc or a corporation the owners must file formal documents with the state and observe more technical requirements in their operations which can sometimes distract the owners from confronting important issues about the way they work together one obvious advantage of forming a partnership is that you don’t have to pay costly filing and other fees as you would to form a corporation but overall most business owners conclude as we have that the advantages and disadvantages of these three ways to organize your business are not as significant as many advocates of one or the other approach would have you believe for example suppose you and two friends are coowners of a computer repair business it’s clearly prudent to decide what will happen if one person unexpectedly quits or dies a common method of handling this is to create a “buyout” clause enabling the remaining owners to purchase usually over time the interest of the departing owner if the business is owned as a partnership the buy­out clause you devise will normally be included in the partnership agreement if the business is an llc the clause will be in the owners’ operating agreement in a corporation this clause is normally put in the bylaws or in a shareholders’ agreement but the practical reality will be the same below we look in depth at key issues concerning the form of ownership of a shared business we’ll start here by summarizing the most important points • the partnership form is the simplest and least expensive of the three forms to create and maintain • for small shared ownership businesses that face risks of major money lawsuits the llc is usually the best initial choice • for most other types of small shared ownership businesses the partnership form is normally the best choice if business growth makes a different structure more desirable the partners can easily convert to an llc or a corporation • occasionally the corporate form makes sense for a new business for instance a corporation may be desirable if the owners want to raise large sums of money from a number of investors   resource want more information on other business structures in this book about partnerships the discussion of other ways to organize your business is necessarily limited for a more indepth discussion of the pros and cons of sole proprietorships llcs and corporations see legal guide for starting  running a small business by fred s steingold nolo and llc or corporation by anthony mancuso nolo   limited liability shareholders of an llc or corporation are not normally personally liable for corporate debts or liability stemming from lawsuits as long as the llc or corporation is adequately capitalized that is it has sufficient cash or other assets invested this is called “limited liability” in partnerships all partners have openended personal liability for all partnership debts but before you rush to form an llc or incorporate you should know that the difference between limited and unlimited liability is often less significant than many people believe there are two important forms of liability almost any business must deal with lawsuits and business debts to deal with the first possibility most small business people with common sense whether incorporated or not purchase insurance to protect them from the most obvious sorts of liability claims such as insurance protecting restaurant owners from claims filed by customers who become ill or fall down in the premises an llc or a corporation’s limited liability is obviously no substitute for business liability insurance since limited liability doesn’t protect the assets of the llc or corporation itself from being wiped out by a successful claim however limited liability can be a valuable protection if a small business is engaged in a highrisk activity and insurance coverage is unavailable or too expensive many—perhaps millions—of american busi­nesses including many retailers and small service providers do not normally face serious risk of liability stemming from their business aside from things like vehicle accidents which obviously can and should be covered by insurance for instance businesses as varied as a shoe store a graphic design outfit a small religious publishing company or an icecream parlor are very unlikely to face a lawsuit for large sums of money by contrast other types of business—for instance manufacturers or businesses that handle toxic materials—have a much higher risk of liability claims and because they do it’s often prohibitively expensive for the owners of these types of businesses to purchase insurance to cover potential lawsuit judgments some other types of highrisk businesses include • accountants there have been some huge successful claims against accounting firms for negligence in some of these situations accountants were found to be liable when they helped businesses conceal large losses or other damaging financial facts thus costing investors and suppliers millions • lawyers law firms can also face immense financial exposure for negligent or worse conduct this conduct can range from actively participating in or at least negligently abetting fraudulent behavior by a client to causing financial injury to the law firm’s own client • architects and construction companies in the day of multimilliondollar judgments for injured persons and frequent problems with cost overruns everyone in the construction field is vulnerable to suit for all sorts of reasons • real estate increasingly buyers of property who later discover undisclosed defects—everything from termites water in the basement land shifting or a nasty nextdoor neighbor—sue both the seller and the real estate people who represent the seller this list is intended to be instructive not exhaus­tive we can’t give you definitive advice about the liabilitylawsuit risks of the type of business you plan to engage in only you can decide how serious these risks are and what kinds of steps you can sensibly take to eliminate or at least minimize them the higher the risk the more desirable an llc or corporation and obviously the lower the risks the more a partnership agreement combined with basic liability insurance such as for “slip and fall” accidents on the business premises and vehicle insurance should safely protect you but what about debts if the business loses money as lots of new ventures do doesn’t limited liability protect individual owners from having personal assets taken as part of an llc or corporate bankruptcy or liquidation again while the answer is “yes” in theory in reality limited liability protection is likely to be immaterial why because lenders and major creditors are well aware of the rules of limited owner liability banks landlords and other savvy businesspeople routinely require the owners of a new small business whether a partnership an llc or a corporation to personally guarantee any loan or significant extension of credit made to the business by doing this llc or corporate owners put themselves on much the same legal footing with their creditors as if they ran their business as a partnership however we should note that because many providers of routine business supplies and services do not require a personal guarantee from llc or corporation owners these owners can escape personal liability for these types of debts if the business becomes insolvent here’s another important restriction on the limited liability of corporate and llc owners a corpo­ration or llc must start with a minimally reasonable amount of cash “capital” to function in the business world if the entity is only a shell without the cash necessary to function a court may “pierce the corporate veil” and hold individual corporate or llc owners personally responsible for all the entity’s debts whether they personally guaranteed them or not while it is fairly rare for a court to determine that a corporation or llc was undercapitalized it can happen particularly if fraud is involved   business continuity corporations have “eternal life” this means that if one or even all of the principal owners of a small corporation dies the corporate entity continues to exist partnerships on the other hand can dissolve when any partner withdraws or dies however this difference is also immaterial in real life it’s easy and fully legal to insert a standard clause in your partnership agreement that provides that the partnership entity continues after one owner leaves or dies llcs are often functionally similar to partner­ships regarding business continuity as noted a partnership can technically dissolve when one partner retires dies or withdraws similarly some state statutes require members of an llc to vote to continue the llc within a specified period of time after a member withdraws or dies if they do not the llc is technically dissolved many llc operating agreements provide that an owner’s departure triggers a vote by the remaining owners on whether to continue the llc the effect is that if the owners wish it the llc will continue in business without legal interruption additionally a few states require llcs to establish termination dates in their articles of organi­zation even in those states however the owners can easily keep the business going by filing an amendment to the llc’s articles of organization extending the date on which the llc is scheduled to dissolve partnership owners do not have to face this hassle because no state has laws requiring a termination date for a partnership if one of the two coowners of an llc or small corporation quits or dies the survivor of the business will face the same issues that would face a surviving partner no matter what business structure you choose you’ll want to compensate a departing owner or his or her heirs fairly but you’ll also want to preserve the business for the remaining owners how is the value of that departing interest to be calculated how can the remaining owners be assured they’ll have adequate cash to buy out a departing owner we discuss methods of resolving these problems in chapter  our point now is simply that you don’t avoid any of them by choosing to form an llc or a corporation rather than a partnership   caution a general partnership isn’t the right choice if you want to raise money from people who won’t participate in the business for larger businesses that need to raise money from outside investors and will comply with complicated federal and state securities registration and sales laws to do so it can sometimes be psychologically easier to raise capital by selling stock to passive investors than by trying to sell participation in a partnership which will constitute a limited partnership—see chapter    transfer of ownership corporate ownership comes in the form of shares that can theoretically be transferred to new owners by contrast a partner’s interest cannot be transferred without the consent of all partners unless as is rarely the case the partnership agree­ment expressly allows for free transferability similarly an owner of an llc is usually restricted by state law or the members’ operating agreement or both from transferring an ownership interest in the business without the consent of all other owners but does this legal difference really add up to a practical difference the answer is clearly no for two reasons first when it comes to small closely held corporations state law often restricts the right of a shareholder to freely transfer shares no matter what the shareholders want second and more importantly the stock of most small corporations is extremely difficult or even impossible to sell there is no regular public market for small business interests shares of small corporations are not listed on stock exchanges and outsiders are rarely interested in working closely with total strangers particularly if they can’t purchase a majority controlling interest even if the business is doing well a potential buyer will probably be more interested in purchasing the entire business or profitable business assets for example a building patent invention inventory and so on than one owner’s shares finally even if the shares or one person’s llc interest or partnership interest in a small business could be sold to an outside buyer there are likely to be drawbacks the success of almost any small business depends on the efforts and skills of a few people if one of a corporation’s owners can summarily transfer her interest to an outsider the business and other owners are obviously vulnerable if the new owner has no ability to help the corporation or is unacceptable for any other reason to protect against this happening the bylaws or shareholders’ agreement of many small corporations—just like the partnership agreements of most partnerships and operating agreements of llcs—restrict the right of any owner to sell to a third person and provide that the remaining owners have the option to buy out the interest of any departing owner so again the realities of running a small business dictate that the owners take certain similar steps to limit or prevent sales to outside buyers no matter what the legal form of the business   business formalities no state or federal law or agency requires a partner­ship to file its original agreement or maintain any ongoing paperwork by contrast government paperwork and costs are required to start up an llc or a corporation an llc must prepare articles of organization and file them with the secretary or department of state the costs for the initial filing are modest in most states—typically  or so some states impose yearly fees or franchise taxes which can be more substantial  in california some states also require new llcs to publish a notice in a local newspaper once it’s operational an llc generally does not have to observe the same formalities as a corporation such as holding annual meetings but can mostly function with the informality of a partnership like a partnership an llc can function with exactly the amount of formality—formal meetings quorum requirements keeping minutes of meetings and so on—that the owners want most states do however require llcs to file a brief annual report in addition to any fees or taxes imposed this annual form usually requires basic business information such as the name and addresses of the current owner and the business agent for service of process legal papers creating and maintaining a corporation is usually more expensive than creating an llc filing incorporation papers costs  to  and up in some states for example in california the cost is a  filing fee and after the corporation’s first year a minimum annual franchise tax of  if you hire a lawyer to set up your corporation the total costs can easily approach – or more running a corporation also requires more continuing paperwork such as organizing and calling annual shareholders and directors meetings preparing minutes of major decisions and issuing share certificates in many states it is possible to adopt provisions in a corporation’s bylaws that allow the corporation to skip many of these rules and operate relatively informally banks and other financial institutions however often demand a properly prepared corporate resolution before approving a loan or other transaction however it remains accurate to say that partnerships normally can be created and operated with much less formality   resource resources to incorporate your business you can form your corporation online using nolo’s online corporation at wwwnolocom how to form your own california corporation by anthony

state by anthony mancuso nolo further the corporate records handbook meetings minutes  resolutions by anthony mancuso nolo provides all the forms and information corporations in any state need to properly document ongoing business matters using these books can significantly reduce the cost of creating and maintaining a corporation   the perceived formality of corporate existence is sometimes said to encourage some people to maintain better records and to engage in more organized management practices there may be some truth in this especially when a sole proprietorship is incorporated but there is no logical reason why a partnership can’t install excellent business controls and practices in our experience most successful ones do   taxation a partnership is not taxed partnership net income profits is taxed only on the individual partners’ income tax returns an llc can choose to be taxed as a partnership or as a small corporation most llcs choose to be taxed in the same way as partnerships you might think that partnerships and llcs enjoy a real advantage over corporations because corporate profits are taxed twice first at the corporate level and then at the shareholder level while partnership or llc income is only taxed once for small businesses this distinction usually is immaterial small corporations can often avoid double taxation they can pay out to owners most of what would otherwise be corporate profits in the form of salaries bonuses and other fringe benefits rather than in dividends as long as the owners actually work in the business and the salaries aren’t outrageously unreasonable paying the owners salaries as employees is acceptable to the irs because monies paid in salaries bonuses social security health plans and other fringe benefits are deductible business expenses for the corporation these expenses are not subject to corporate tax in this way many small corporations reduce their corporate income to zero and corporate income is taxed only at the individual level in some situations corporate taxation allows small business people to pay less overall tax on their income by retaining a portion of corporate or llc profits in the corporation from one year to the next the individual shareholder owner is taxed only on income received whether in the form of corporate salary or as profits the profits retained by the corporation or llc are also taxed but at a generally lower rate  for the first  and  on the next  than individual income in a partnership or an llc that has chosen to be taxed like a partnership these retained profits would be taxed as income to the partners at their marginal rate which will probably be much higher whether or not they actually received any cash for businesses that will pay all profits to owneremployees in the form of salaries and benefits these initial low rates of corporate taxation offer no advantage however if your business will need to retain substantial earnings for future operations incorporating is likely to make economic sense corporations can retain profits of up to  for future needs without question by the irs llcs do not have this right the  corporate retained earnings rule does not apply to certain personal service corporations owned by professionals such as doctors and lawyers which are limited to  and if the corporation has a valid business reason it can easily retain much more than  small corporate businesses can also avoid double taxation by electing something called federal “s corporation” status an s corporation functions like a partnership for income tax purposes thus an s corporation doesn’t pay income taxes on profits only the shareholders do you may ask “why form an s corporation if you can attain the same tax results with a partnership or llc” good question the s corporation is rapidly being superseded by the llc which offers both principal attractions of an s corporation—limited liability and passthrough taxation further llcs are far more flexible than s corporations which have to comply with complicated irs rules finally a corporation or an llc can establish a taxdeductible pension andor profitsharing plan for all its workers including working shareholders andor managing owners while a partnership pension plan is only tax deductible for employees not for partners themselves however this difference too is often more apparent than real since partners are eligible for individual profitsharing retirement plans which tend to equalize tax treatment termination when a corporation is dissolved and distributes appreciated property to shareholders the gain increase in value is taxed both to the corporation and to the shareholders this means that it can potentially be more expensive to close down a profitable corporation than a partnership or an llc that has elected to be taxed like a partnership summing up we come back to where we started for many perhaps most people who are planning a sharedownership business there are few realworld advantages to forming an llc or a corporation rather than a partnership one exception is for owners of small businesses in fields where there’s a plausible risk of lawsuits against the business for large amounts of money a partnership agreement focuses on the basic issues that must be resolved to establish a sharedownership business with a minimum of red tape and cost therefore we generally recommend the partnership form for sharedownership small businesses that are unlikely to face large debts or the threat of scary lawsuits we hope you enjoyed this
