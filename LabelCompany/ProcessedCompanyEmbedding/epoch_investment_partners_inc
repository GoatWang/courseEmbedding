investment process investment philosophy our investment strategy reflects the changing hierarchy of the three determinants of equity investment returns earnings dividends and pe multiples historical perspective over time the relative importance of these three determinants has changed dramatically in response to changes in the economic landscape in the s and s for example rising pe ratios were the principal drivers of equity returns leading to the popularity of valuation methodologies that reflected pricetobook value and pricetoearnings metrics underlying this year pe expansion was a collapse in interest rates beginning in june  however this twodecade period of declining interest rates and expanding pe ratios showed signs of coming to an end we believe we have entered a period in which pe ratios are more likely to contract than expand as interest rates begin to rise rather than fall from recent historic lows given the inverse relationship of pe ratios to interest rates the expansion of pe multiples will no longer be the primary explanatory variable of equity returns this leaves earnings growth and dividends the two variables that have been the dominant sources of equity returns over the past  years these two variables are derived from a single source cash flow components of equity returns by decade sp  index  a focus on cash flow epoch’s security selection process is thus focused on freecashflow metrics as opposed to traditional accountingbased metrics in our view the key to producing superior riskadjusted equity returns is the identification of companies with a consistent ability to both generate free cash flow and to properly allocate it among internal reinvestment opportunities acquisitions dividends share repurchases and debt repayments the determination of how to deploy free cash flow should be guided by the company’s cost of capital acquisitions and reinvestments should only be undertaken when the return on capital is greater than the firm’s average cost of capital otherwise free cash flow should be returned to shareholders via the other three uses dividends share buybacks and debt repayments epoch defines these three uses of free cash flow as “shareholder yield” how corporations allocate free cash flow stock selection before making an investment we analyze a company as if we were looking to purchase the entire business we invest in businesses with understandable operating models transparent financial statements and a proven ability to generate free cash flow we also seek securities that in our view have unrecognized potential
