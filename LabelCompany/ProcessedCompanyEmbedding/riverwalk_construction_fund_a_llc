sued regions bank has filed suit against the developers of a south waterfront condominium project seen here in january regions alleges that companies that include cityview at riverwalk llc owe more than  million on a construction loan that is in default posted may    comments share by josh flory posted may    regions bank lawsuit against the developers of cityview at riverwalk condominiums regions bank has filed suit against the developers of a south waterfront condominium project that has been promoted as a cornerstone for creation of a residential community along fort loudoun lake across from downtown in the lawsuit filed friday in knox county chancery court regions alleges that georgia companies including cityview at riverwalk llc owe more than  million on a construction loan that now is in default cityview at riverwalk is a unit condomarina project on blount avenue where the knoxville glove co once operated that broke ground more than two years ago other defendants named in the complaint are glove factory land holdings llc blount ave marina investors michael j blonder and bradley g johnson blonder and johnson are executives at atlantabased focus development although that firm was not named in the suit its web site lists cityview at riverwalk as one of the projects in its portfolio a spokesman for focus said the firm has not had a chance to review the suit and could not discuss it at this time the lawsuit alleges that regions has not received interest payments for either february or march of this year in addition the suit said that even if regions disbursed the remaining available funds under the construction loan the borrowers would be unable to complete the condominium project because such funds would be insufficient to provide for all of the necessary remaining construction and improvements in january a partner with atlantabased focus development confirmed that deposits made on approximately  of the projects  presold units had been refunded for failure to meet contractual obligations due to delayed completion the lawsuit though alleges that there are approximately  presale contracts in place for the purchase of condo units in the project the lawsuit seeks a judgment for the loan amount owed and asks for an order authorizing a receiver to take control of the property and the condo project the receiver would manage completion of construction and operate the property once construction is done regions also claims that it has not received financial statements from the borrowers as required under the loan agreement and that the borrowers have allowed liens to be filed against the project for unpaid labor and materials blonder and johnson could not be reached for comment according to the suit regions made a construction loan for  million to sister companies glove factory blount ave and cityview for the condo project the amount was later increased to  million with blonder and johnson guaranteeing payment of the loan regions also contends in the suit that the borrowers and knoxvilles community development corp entered into a development and financing agreement in september  that would fund part of the development under a tax increment financing loan for  million from bbt regions also provided the riverwalk developers with a separate mezzanine loan for  million to help in development in  knoxville city council members approved a measure making the projects site its own tax increment financing district under a tif developers borrow private money to pay for infrastructure improvements but use all or part of the new property tax revenue from the project to pay down those debts regions is seeking to receive and disburse proceeds from the tax increment financing loan alvin nance executive director and ceo of kcdc said tif funds have been expended but only on public improvements in the area nance said he wasnt aware the construction loan was in default he said the situation is unfortunate but kcdc hasnt
