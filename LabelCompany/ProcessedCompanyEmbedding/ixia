protocols lies within different members of a testing team a common painpoint for our customers was the lack of a collaboration tool to aid them in incrementally building configurations with the resource manager users can now piecemeal their configurations together the resource manager allows users to save different pieces of their configurations like protocols and traffic elements and then build a configuration by reusing saved elements in their current configuration   resource manager it also allows users to clearly see changes made to their resourcesconfigurations by using a “diff” functionality within the application using the resource manager is a powerful way to collaborate and quickly build expertise with a team reports building a testresults report requires test data ixreporter introduces a new database referred to in the application as an “object model” the object model is populated by a testing application like ixnetwork with the test configuration parameters and the test results all of these “objects” can be included in a report usually in a table or chart with this powerful concept tables and charts can be created which combine statistics and configuration information as well as have multiple protocols automation ixnetwork provides powerful guibased automation with test composer and quicktest it also has a robust feature set for

ensures updates every  days for select protocols including aol webmail aol instant messenger google talk google gmail icq jabber msn hotmail windows live messenger yahoo mail yahoo messenger stay up to date with malware and botnet attacks with our monthly malware and botnet quickly initiate a comprehensive and targeted test in about  seconds using the ati super flows realworld mixes of applications and their behavior ie one super flow creates the exact application traffic from a large european service provider at night with smartphone users ensure testing with realworld application traffic mix with ati native application protocol support that includes a configurable weight per protocol and dynamic application content to simulate reality so application data changes exactly as a real application would breakingpoint test traffic is defined hierarchically from libraries of flows super flows and application profiles each of the library elements can be used directly or modified to the user’s needs flows are application protocols that are provided by ati for common applications super flows are a sequence of flows that create a series of behaviors of client or client and server operations an example of a super flow would be the behavior of a gmail session where a gmail client steps through all the required sequences of resolving dns query conducting tls authentication session with a gmail server retrieving the mail and then closing the session application profiles are container for groups of super flows that a breakingpoint test component will use to create a specified test as of the publishing of this data sheet breakingpoint includes  superflows from over  applications and this library continues to grow with ati updates applications categories included authentication chatim data transferfile sharing distributed computing emailwebmail enterprise applications games mobile   remote access scada secure data transfer security social networkingsearch storage systemnetwork admin telephonycable tv testing and measurement  voicevideomedia     application protocol simulation realworld application simulation with dynamic content each protocol is natively implemented not a pcap replay configurable application actions flow to simulate multiple and dynamic protocol behavior configurable application action parameters highlevel web application protocol implementation such as youtube gmail ebay and more no need to set the http layer breakingpoint will convert the application layer into http ability to simulate all application protocols as part of a single protocol mix each application protocol is a unique application flow it can be of the same protocol with a different behavior or a different application protocol use of real files as application attachments ie email attachment or protocol content application token support the token goal is to deliver a dynamic and realistic traffic pattern for each application tokens allow the user to randomize data as part of the application flow to prevent devices from accelerating bandwidth or detecting static data patterns tokens can be used on both the local level a specific action such as http get uri and global level protocol level such as host name application markov token support markov token is a unique way of converting documents into new documents which is a random data by word instead of by character which allows the data to look realistic but at the same time to be dynamic application ifelse with regex support the ifelse action delivers the ability to make decisions from both client and server side during the data flow once the action detects a specific match of data it can decide what to do next in addition it can capture data from the flow and reuse it later when needed application protocol realistic behavior applications can open more than one session ie web browsing will open a “main page” connection and all sub objects will be retrieved over sub connections application multisessions are always synced ie ftp control and data session rtsp and rtp sip and rtp applications as part of a protocol mix are weighted by bandwidth or users in order to reflect realistic application usage below is a sample enterprise application protocol mix distribution strike list the strike list is the central location for customizing attack traffic from the strike list you can customize attacks by grouping strikes together the evasion profile settings establish the evasion techniques for a single group of strikes the strike list is the toplevel security group it contains all of the attacks and evasion options that will be used in a security test you can use any default strike list to exploit vulnerabilities in various hosts and applications however if you need more granular control over the attack traffic you can customize your own attacks through the strike list when you create a new strike list it will have its own set of options that determine which evasion techniques to use in the attack traffic you can create as many strike lists as you want each strike list will have its own set of strike options so you should create a strike list for each unique set of evasion options that you need the breakingpoint device provides you with a set of default strike lists that have been customdesigned by the security team at ixia to target specific types of security testing – whether strikes targeting port scanning specific protocols or unpatched   strike specifications malicious and attack simulation strikes over  strikes such as sql inj xss bufferoverflow all attacks are natively implementation rather than a capture replay of an attack strikes are documented by cve bugtraq osvdb over  evasion techniques to hide the attack form the security device malware over  malwares all malwares are fully armed ddos simulation integrated fpga for l ddos in parallel with the application traffic each application protocol can be manipulated to simulate a layer  ddos attack ie dns flood http uri scan http get flood etc ddos and any other type of traffic can be generated simultaneously from the same port at the same time layer  ip  icmp

components breakingpoint is controlled from a web browser using the https protocol so no local client installation is required it offers a single gui for management results in simple central control of all components and capabilities alternatively a tool command language tcl api and tcl shell interface is provided for building and executing automated tests ixia’s strike center web site allows immediate access to os releases new application protocols and attack updates and documentation best of all updates of applications and attacks strikepacks do not require reboot or licenses the steps for building a test include reserving the physical ports that will be used defining a network neighborhood building an application profiles andor security strikes list that will be used in the test choosing the test components that will be assigned to the network interfaces breakingpoint includes many prebuilt common tests application profiles and strike lists that can be used directly or modified to fit the exact needs of the test network neighborhood the network neighborhood is a powerful tool that defines the possible addresses the system can use for its generated test traffic and determines how the system will allocate those addresses for use all addresses used in test traffic generated by the breakingpoint device must follow the protocol rules as though the addresses were a real host existing within a real subnet on the network addressing information for each test interface is designated with component tags each defining the host addresses that can be used in the test traffic as well as the subnet and routing information for those hosts the addressing will fill the entire subnet but you can limit the number of addresses by defining a range for the network the network neighborhood determines the type of network in which the device is operating eg routed switched or vlan the addresses that can be used for the ethernet source and destination ip addresses after the system looks at the network neighborhood you have selected for the test it will look at the component tags that are selected for each interface these component tags contain the subnets that the system will use to derive its addressing breakingpoint test components are virtual devices that enable you to test how well your device will operate at different network layers each test component comes with a set of parameters which you can use to create the type of traffic you want descriptions of the primary breakingpoint test components follow see the breakingpoint reference manual for more details application simulator application simulator enables you to connect your breakingpoint hardware network elements to a single network device or interconnected network infrastructure elements application simulator comment models both the client and server side of the communication transactions this type of test is referred to as a twoarm test the application simulator test component allows you to generate application traffic flows this test component is typically be used in conjunction with other test components to simulate real world traffic the application simulator test component uses an app profile to determine what types of application flows to send to the dut the app profile contains a set of flow specifications that defines the protocol clienttype and servertype with the traffic that will use client simulator client simulator enables you to connect your breakingpoint hardware to a real server device under test so the chassis can act as a client generating connections to the server this type of test is commonly referred to as a onearm test client simulator sends a single super flow to the dut and enables you to search for specific responses from the dut client simulator uses conditional requests in super flows that define the specific responses ie strings or patterns you expect to see from the dut the client simulator component will track the number of responses from the server that match the string matches defined within the conditional requests for the super flow security the security test component can be used to test network security devices – such as ipss idss firewalls antiddos applications and proxies it measures a device’s ability to protect a host by sending strikes and verifying that the device successfully blocks the attacks simply select a strike list and an evasion setting to create a security test or use one of the default options additionally the security component allows you to edit evasion profiles to override any evasion options that are configured for an evasion setting or configured within the strike list breakingpoints security component subjects a network security device to  attacks under cveid bugtraqid and osvdb to validate its blocking capabilities or to confirm the stability of devices under attack onearm security testing allows you to test the authenticity of the attack traffic generated by the security component it targets a specific destination address or range of addresses through the test port of the chassis it is designed to trigger the vulnerabilities in your device rather than exploit them for access therefore this mode will put your device in a crash condition and it will not result in code execution on the device under test security np the security np component enables generation of malware traffic at high load it is used for validating the attack detection performance of the idsips engine this component has the same behavior as the security component however has higher performance as it is executed in the network processor rather than by the cpu session sender the session sender test component enables testing of pure tcp andor udp behavior and performance it is also capable of performing advanced ddos attacks it uses a unique pair of source and destination port numbers for tcp udp icmp or combinations session capacity testing each session uses a unique combination of source addresses destination addresses source ports and destination ports routing robot the routing robot component delivers rfc benchmark testing and network ddos simulation by using an fpga technology it is capable of generating wire speed traffic of ip and udp stateless traffic the rfc standard defines several test cases for switching and routing benchmarks including packetloss max throughput and network latency the routing robot test component determines if a dut routes traffic properly by sending routable traffic from one interface and monitoring the receiving interface to see if the traffic is successfully received routing robot functions is commonly used in testing forwarding performance test such as rfc bit blaster the bit blaster test component analyzes a device’s ability to handle highspeed traffic by identifying whether or not the dut receives and sends packets without corrupting or dropping them the bit blaster component only transmits layer  frames which means that it can only be used in a switching environment for routing or nat environments use the routing robot test component to generate highspeed routable traffic bit blaster functions include stack scrambler the stack scrambler test component tests the integrity of different protocol stacks by sending malformed ip tcp udp icmp and ethernet packets produced by a fuzzing technique to the device under test the fuzzing technique modifies a part of the packet checksum protocol options etc to generate the corrupt data recreate the recreate test component supports importing capture files in standard libpcap used by tools such as tcpdump and libpcap files compressed with gzip this component allows you to capture traffic in your production network and then have breakingpoint replay that traffic during a test exactly as captured or with additional enhancements to create even more realism for example recreate captures each pcap flow’s complete l data stored in individual files and grouped according to protocol then recreate can be configured to adjust ipv configuration ipv configuration source port tcp configuration and data rate of the captured flows templates there are templates for each test component that have been preconfigured for the breakingpoint system they cannot be modified or deleted however you can use them as a baseline for creating new templates or add a template from scratch templates contain predefined component configurations that can be reused in other tests all parameter definitions interface selections and descriptions are stored in the template once you save a component as a template it will be listed under the load a template section of the component type on which it is based these templates can be treated like any other test component templates are particularly useful if you are using the tcl interface to test a device you can create templates that contain the necessary test configuration parameters built into them therefore when you reference the template from the tcl interface you will not need to configure any of the parameters for the component device under test profile a dut profile defines the connection settings for the device under test – such as the connection method connection parameters interface speed and global scripts the breakingpoint device will use these settings to establish a connection to the dut for automation purposes you can use expect scripts also known as global scripts to automate your device testing for example you can create scripts that will create vlans to create a dut profile you must clone an existing dut profile cloned dut profiles will inherit all connection parameters and global scripts of the parent dut profile however you can reconfigure the cloned dut profile as desired reporting breakingpoint provides extensive reports that provide detailed information about the test such as the components used in a test the addressing information the dut profile configuration the system versions and the results of the test all reports include an aggregated test results section which provides the combined statistics for all of the test components it also includes the information over time to pinpoint a potential error within the timeslot it happened all reports are automatically generated in html and viewable with a web browser however you may export the test results in xls html pdf rtf csv or zip csv files reports are automatically generated each time a test is run and are viewable from the results page the comparison report feature allows you to run multiple iterations of the same test on different load modules or different ports and compare the results you have the option of comparing all sections of the tests or you can select only certain sections to be included in the comparison example of the reported test results per application protocol throughput transaction rate successunsuccessful response time and more for stateful tcp oneway
