managing partner and cio dominic napolitano discusses the “ portfolio allocations environment” at the january th ivy family office network forum we spend our time understanding the merits of each manager and how they fit in our portfolios while looking for high risk adjusted returns on both the long and short side we also are looking for managers who have top down themes and risk management greenwich ct prweb january   talson capital management’s managing partner and cio dominic napolitano headlined the ivy family office network fairfield county forum with a panel discussion on “ portfolio allocations” the forum was held on january  in greenwich ct according to mr napolitano “long and short investing should be well suited to outperform in  correlations are at very low levels which play well for actively managed funds that can identify and benefit from idiosyncratic risk on both the long and short side opportunistic managers who are more tactical and nimble have a great environment ahead in addition eventdriven managers especially those in the mid cap space where activity picked up in the double digits in  should see a much bigger opportunity set going forward corporate cash balances remain high and we are seeing more share buy backs ma activity and restructurings this coupled with the fact that investors have been fleeing equities in an effort to reach for yield over the last few years leads us to believe that longshort investing primarily in global equities should prove profitable” other speakers on the panel included steven macnamara founder and managing member of horizons west capital partners victoria vysotina founder and ceo of vv strategic group and amiel goldberg managing principal  goldberg  hohmann llc mr napolitano went on to say that the industry is immensely diverse and the dispersion of returns between the top and bottom decile managers is quite wide “we spend all of our time understanding the merits of each manager and how they fit in our portfolios while looking for high risk adjusted returns on both the long and short side we also are looking for managers who have top down themes and risk management while building the portfolios from the bottom up” “while macro themes will continue to impact market fluctuations managers are more accustomed to the volatility and looking through that to the underlying fundamentals of companies at talson we are invested in many of these managers our portfolios are built with capital preservation and meaningful upside capture in mind ” dominic napolitano is the founder and managing member of talson partners lp prior to founding the partnership from   mr napolitano was employed by soros fund management one of the largest family offices in the world where he was instrumental in
