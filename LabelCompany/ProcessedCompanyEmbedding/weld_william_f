closely watched senate races that year noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another kerry and weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading

abortion rights and the legalization of medical marijuana this refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former united states attorney general and friend of helms edwin meese

from doing but weld relished the opportunity saying it feels like being in a campaign i feel newly energized i love to stir up the pot i seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up senate majority leader trent lott said that welds chances of being confirmed werent very good and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for there was speculation that the white house would let his nomination die but he refused saying that he hoped president clinton does not plan to give in to ideological extortion and that i wanted to send a message that i wanted to be captain of my ship the nomination even if its going to bottom some speculated that attacking the more conservative helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate republicans in a potential run for president in  but he rejected this saying that ive had a lot of people come up to me on the street and say give em hell thats the bill weld we know and love weld resigned the governorship on july   to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship even though few thought he would be successful there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor a bipartisan majority of senators signed letters demanding that helms advance his nomination but helms refused after an intensive sixweek battle weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on september   he commented sarcastically i asked president clinton to withdraw my name from the senate so i can go back to

effectively blocking it helms was also a republican and their party held the majority in the chamber but helms objected to welds moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights abortion rights and the legalization of medical marijuana this refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former united states attorney general and friend of helms edwin meese meese reportedly had a longstanding grudge against weld stemming from welds investigation of meese during the irancontra affair weld publicly criticized helms which the white house discouraged him from doing but weld relished the opportunity saying it feels like being in a campaign i feel newly energized i love to stir up the pot i seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up

uncalled for there was speculation that the white house would let his nomination die but he refused saying that he hoped president clinton does not plan to give in to ideological extortion and that i wanted to send a message that i wanted to be captain of my ship the nomination even if its going to bottom some speculated that attacking the more conservative helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate republicans in a potential run for president in  but he rejected this saying that ive had a lot of people come up to me on the street and say give em hell thats the bill weld we know and love weld resigned the governorship on july   to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship even though few thought he would be successful there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor a bipartisan majority of senators signed letters demanding that helms advance his nomination but helms refused after an intensive sixweek battle weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on september   he commented sarcastically i asked president clinton to withdraw my name from the senate so i can go back to

first reported wednesday by the associated press took weld’s business partners and the current republican governor his protégé charlie baker by surpriseweld’s strategy according to people with whom he has spoken is to take advantage of the anticipated media attention paid to two former governors from different parts of the country joining forces hoping to win sufficient support to land in the

if that bankshot approach works weld according to those who have spoken to him and johnson hope to deny trump — as well as the likely democratic nominee former secretary of state hillary clinton — the  electoral votes needed to win the white house that scenario would cast the election into the house of representatives which is currently controlled by republicansas of wednesday night baker a former

had a conversation with governor weld about this    baker only knows what he has seen through the media” said jim conroy a senior baker adviser who left the administration earlier this year but remains close to the governorasked if baker would support a weld bid if the vicepresidential run materialized conroy replied “the governor is unaware if this is even the case doesn’t know very much about gary johnson and is focused on his priorities in state government and on supporting local republicans and the ballot initiatives he is supporting”weld — who was in canada this week on business — had not confirmed to his colleagues at mintz levin or its lobbying arm ml strategies wednesday evening that he had decided to join the ticketml strategies president steve tocco — a longtime weld

communications director joe hunter’s confirmation of the ap storya leap to a national ticket could force upon weld a decision on whether to remain at the downtown legal and lobbying powerhouse which

senator scott brown has backed trump as has its longtime national committeeman ron kaufman the party’s chairwoman kirsten hughes has said she would back the party’s nominee but has not explicitly endorsed trumpand the party’s last gop governor  presidential nominee mitt romney has actively worked against trump and warned of a disastrous presidency if he is elected — as has former acting governor jane swiftweld’s entry into the presidential campaign makes him the first if not the most likely prominent massachusetts politician to join the fray in a political season that has defied expectations and at times even description the list of state political figures who have been mentioned in conjecture with a national ticket includes romney brown us senator elizabeth warren former democratic governor deval patrick and secretary of state john f kerry the democrats’  nominee in the event that clinton tankedit is far from weld’s first dalliance with straying from party orthodoxy

former republican governor of massachusetts who was last seen campaigning in the  republican primary for governor of new york now hopes to be on a national ticket as the vicepresidential nominee of the libertarian partyand he is already on the attackin his first interview since accepting an invitation to be the running mate of former gov gary johnson of new mexico mr weld assailed donald j trump over his call to round up and deport the  million immigrants in the country illegally“i can hear the glass crunching on kristallnacht in the ghettos of warsaw and vienna when i hear that honest” mr weld said thursdaymr weld  was not uniformly critical of the presumptive republican nominee “i don’t consider myself part of the never trump movement” he said expressing admiration for mr trump’s success in the primary contest advertisement continue reading the main story “i’m not horrified about everything mr trump has done at all” he said adding “i think he’s done a lot but when i think about some of the positions i think they’re way out there” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story where he differs with mr trump most sharply is on mr trump’s call for mass deportationsasked if he believed mr trump was a fascist mr weld demurred “my kristallnacht analogy does evoke the nazi period in germany” he said “and that’s what i’m worried about a slippery slope” photo former gov gary johnson of new mexico waiting to speak with utah state legislators on wednesday in salt lake city has found his running mate as a libertarian party presidential candidate credit rick bowmerassociated press after a circuitous answer he eventually came to a conclusion “no i wouldn’t call mr trump either a fascist or a nazi” mr weld said “i’m just saying we got to watch it when we get exclusionary about people on account of their status as a member of a group”mr weld also objected to mr trump’s repeated threats to impose tariffs on goods imported from mexico and china “that’s a pretty good prescription to having china be the only superpower in about  years” he said leaning forward to make sure a reporter understood him “china — not the us”mr weld’s best known previous turn on the national stage was in  when he resigned as governor to focus on his appointment by president bill clinton as ambassador to mexicothat did not go well he was blocked by senator jesse helms and withdrew his nomination after a heated battle in which mr weld a pillar of what was left of the moderate northeastern republican establishment loudly assailed mr helms and the archconservatives who stood behind hima former prosecutor mr weld could appeal to some disaffected republicans on a ticket alongside mr johnson at a time when other efforts by republicans to recruit a thirdparty candidate — in part in the hopes of keeping antitrump republican voters from staying home and costing the party’s lowertier candidates — are close to fizzlingmr weld said mr johnson the libertarian presidential candidate in  who is seeking the party’s nomination again spoke to him last weekend about running their hope is to amass enough support in national polls to be included in the presidential debates if that happened mr weld said hopefully it would not be impossible to envision a minorparty ticket winning the white house advertisement continue reading the main story but he also did not protest too much when asked how he would reassure those who mindful of his willingness to roll the dice in politics might question his level of commitment to a national run open graphic

criticize“i thought the game was worth the candle there and that’s politically incorrect in almost all circles — certainly in republican circles — but i think i do feel that way and i followed that closely” mr weld said adding “i know john kerry quite well and i saw his going back and forth and rather admired it” mr weld unsuccessfully challenged mr kerry in the  senate raceasked about hillary clinton mr weld noted that he had known her since they were both in their s “i’ve always just thought of her as a really great kid” he saidmr weld said he possessed a deep libertarian streak and pined

another arena congress the race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched senate races that year noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another kerry and weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading up to the election though facing a traditional uphill battle in a state where democrats outnumbered republicans to and running the same year as the presidential election weld was a popular incumbent governor and polled even with kerry throughout the election in the end senator kerry won reelection with  percent to welds  percent – the last seriously contested senate race in massachusetts until the special election for ted kennedys seat in  notably president bill clinton won massachusetts in  with  of the vote ambassadorship nomination and resignationedit in july  weld was nominated to become united states ambassador to mexico by president bill clinton his nomination stalled after senate foreign relations committee chairman jesse helms refused to hold a hearing on the nomination effectively blocking it helms was also a republican and their party held the majority in the chamber but helms objected to welds moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights abortion rights and the legalization of medical marijuana this refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former united states attorney general and friend of helms edwin meese meese reportedly had a longstanding grudge against weld stemming from welds investigation of meese during the irancontra affair weld publicly criticized helms which the white house discouraged him from doing but weld relished the opportunity saying it feels like being in a campaign i feel newly energized i love to stir up the pot i seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up senate majority leader trent lott said that welds chances of being confirmed werent very good and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for there was speculation that the white house would let his nomination die but he refused saying that he hoped president clinton does not plan to give in to ideological extortion and that i wanted to send a message that i wanted to be captain of my ship the nomination even if its going to bottom some speculated that attacking the more conservative helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate republicans in a potential run for president in  but he rejected this saying that ive had a lot of people
