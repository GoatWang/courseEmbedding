release sec charges trinity capital corporation and former bank executives with accounting fraud for immediate release  washington dc sept  — the securities and exchange commission today announced that trinity capital corporation and its whollyowned subsidiary los alamos national bank have agreed to pay  million to settle accounting fraud charges an sec investigation found that trinity materially misstated its provision for loan losses and its allowance for loan and lease losses in its quarterly and annual filings with the commission during   and the first two quarters of   specifically trinity understated its reported  net loss available to common shareholders by  million reporting income of  million instead of a  million loss five current or former executives also are charged in the case that involves fraudulent manipulation of the company’s financial results and failure to implement sufficient internal accounting controls over loan accounting as alleged in the sec’s complaint the fraud was directed by trinity’s former chief executive officer william enloe former chief credit officer jill cook and former senior lending officer mark pierce  the complaint also alleges that former chief financial officer daniel bartholomew and the vice president of internal audit karl hjelvik failed to implement sufficient internal accounting controls and failed to ensure the bank’s books and records were reasonably accurate  the alleged fraud was motivated at least in part by the bank’s desire to be released from a formal supervisory agreement between the bank and the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank’s primary regulator trinity enloe bartholomew and hjelvik agreed to settle the sec’s charges while the litigation continues against cook and pierce trinity was facing dire financial straits but rather than accurately report its losses we allege that the firms executives grossly misreported its income to shareholders and regulators” said andrew j ceresney director of the sec’s division of enforcement we will hold senior executives liable when they misstate the companys performance and fail to come clean with shareholders according to the sec’s complaint filed in federal court in albuquerque new mexico and the settled administrative proceedings enloe cook and pierce directed trinity’s loan department to engage in a variety of conduct that kept the bank from properly recording losses on its financial statements such as not downgrading loans that were delinquent and making delinquent loans appear to be paying on time not identifying loans for which the bank was not going to be paid in full and not properly measuring individual loans for impairment enloe cook and pierce extended credit to troubled borrowers that was used to make required payments on existing debt which would result in the borrower appearing current on loan payments when in fact the bank was not actually making any collections from the borrower enloe cook and pierce failed to identify loans where it was probable that the bank would be unable to collect all amounts due under the loan agreement  in some instances documents were intentionally drafted to avoid triggering a review of the transactions as troubled loans enloe cook and pierce knew that collateral was worth significantly less – sometimes millions of dollars less – than the amounts used in impairment measurements yet they did nothing to correct the inaccuracies enloe and cook instructed employees to reject and not use appraisals that indicated lower values on the bank’s collateral and other properties pierce drafted and reviewed loan memoranda that were false and misleading and together with enloe and cook permitted them to be presented to outside auditors and others when they knew or were reckless in not knowing that the information hid the troubled nature of various loans bartholomew and hjelvik knew or should have known that certain impairment measurements were not correct and that some appraisal valuations were significantly overstated  in addition neither of them took action to implement adequate internal accounting controls as a result of this and other conduct trinity failed to downgrade loans on a timely basis identify individually impaired loans and measure impairments properly and take appropriate losses on real estate owned by the bank trinity and enloe consented to an order to cease and desist from violating the antifraud reporting books and records and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws  without admitting or denying the sec’s findings trinity agreed to provide ongoing cooperation and to pay a  million penalty which takes into account the company’s significant remedial measures and cooperation during the investigation  enloe agreed to pay a  penalty and also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director at a public company for five years  bartholomew and hjelvik consented to charges of books and records reporting and internal control violations and entered into cooperation agreements with the sec to assist in the litigation against cook and pierce the sec’s complaint filed against cook and pierce alleges they violated or aided and abetted violations of the antifraud lyingtoauditors books and records internal accounting controls and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws  the sec is seeking injunctions civil penalties and officer and director bars   the sec’s investigation was conducted by matthew l skidmore michael f d’angelo and mary s brady and was supervised by thomas j krysa  the sec’s litigation will be led by polly a atkinson and gregory kasper  related materials sec complaint sec orderbartholomew  hjelvik sec orderenloe sec ordertrinity stay connected

  jerry newell bank of the westtrinity capital m r m management there has been speculation for several days in leasing news regarding discussions between trinity capital corporation and bank of the west  i am pleased to confirm the following bank of the west and privately held equipment leasing company trinity capital corporation have signed a letter of intent for an acquisition making san franciscobased trinity capital a wholly owned subsidiary of bank of the west the parties are now negotiating a definitive agreement and expect to finalize this transaction within the next  days  both companies view this combination as highly desirable this transaction underscores bank of the wests commitment to equipment leasing as a core product line  bank of the west has operated a nationwide funding business for equipment leasing brokers for  years and provides direct equipment leases to bank customers  bank of the wests equipment lease portfolio currently exceeds  million  the bank will continue to strongly support and grow its broker funding business which represents more than threequarters of its portfolio in particular we want our lease brokers to know that bank of the west values their business and will continue to protect brokers interests in their transactions  the addition of trinity capital will further expand the scope of the banks equipment leasing product line but is not intended to compete with the banks existing leasing businesses  moreover the market focus of trinity capital is sufficiently different from bank of the wests broker funding business that we do not anticipate any overlap trinity capital will operate as a separate subsidiary of bank of the west and owners jim and donna halow will continue in their executive positions trinity capital corporation was launched  years ago by the halows specializing in nationwide vendor leasing for several vertical market niches trinity has an owned lease portfolio of approximate  million in receivables and also operates an equipment lease servicing business with nearly  million in leases under management   about bank of the west the thirdranked commercial bank headquartered in california san ranciscobased
