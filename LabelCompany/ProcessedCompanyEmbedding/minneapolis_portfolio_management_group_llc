minneapolis portfolio management group  infompmgllccom   value process senior portfolio manager harrison grodnick explains mpmg’s fivestep investment process our process starts with valuations we look for where the potential bargains are in asset classes in world markets and especially in individual companies for it is on the proverbial bargain table where we believe that excess market risks may have been already minimized this means looking for such things as lower pricetosales pricetocash flow pricetobook and pricetofuture earnings ratios among many other factors we also attempt to identify where a company’s business risks may be lessened this means looking for what we believe are solid balance sheets strong assets modest liabilities and wellrooted market shares that said even the least expensive company with the strongest balance sheet may be no bargain if that company’s business is in decline so we look for growing and needed products and services with managements which we believe are committed to growth incented to stay and savvyenough to strongly build their businesses in a highly competitive world finally we look for confirmation that our homework is being echoed by other significant investors and that others are awakening to the potential value of these companies so that we won’t be sitting forever alone waiting for our finds to be discovered and rewarded investment process – buy on the sell side we look for broad awareness of the success of our investments for evidence that a company is reaching its potential and that the final elements of the investing herd

senior portfolio manager harrison grodnick discusses mpmg’s value based philosophy we believe that price is everything it has been our observation that wall street is as much a creature of psychology as it is of economics…that economic conditions whether global or companyspecific tend to be amplified by the actions of the herd stocks – and markets themselves – often move disproportionately to their underlying fundamentals as subtleties of changes in either valuation or growth rates become overrun by masses of buying or selling philosophically we try to take advantage of this for the benefit of our clients so we invest the oldfashioned way – endeavoring to buy low and sell high…by shopping amidst the wellpositioned bargains and then later selling back to the eager finally we believe that there will always be promising bargains somewhere it is our conviction that if one is not constrained by asset class or by nation or by market capitalization one can most often find something attractive the results we take a disciplined approach for both individuals and institutions allowing us to manage for the longer term through the various market cycles has resulted in the all cap value composite portfolio beating the sp  index including reinvestment of dividends for every year for  consecutive years starting in  and for every  year period from  through  all performance
