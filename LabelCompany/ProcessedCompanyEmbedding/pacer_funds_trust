the case of selfindexing funds an affiliated index provider will create a proprietary rulesbased methodology to create underlying indexes each an “affiliated index” except with respect to the selfindexing funds no index provider is or will be an affiliated person or a secondtier affiliate of the trust or a fund of an adviser of any subadviser to or promoter of a fund or of the distributor or any future distributor  applicants recognize that selfindexing funds could raise concerns regarding the ability of the affiliated index provider to manipulate the underlying index to the benefit or detriment of the selfindexing fund applicants further recognize the potential for conflicts that may arise with respect to the personal trading activity of personnel of the affiliated index provider who have knowledge of changes to an underlying index prior to the time that information is publicly disseminated  applicants propose that each day that the trust the nyse and the national securities exchange as defined in section a of the act an “exchange” on which the funds shares are primarily listed “listing exchange” are open for business including any day that a fund is required to be open under section e of the act a “business day” each selfindexing fund will post on its web site before commencement of trading of shares on the listing exchange the identities and quantities of the portfolio holdings held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of its nav at the end of the business day applicants believe that requiring selfindexing funds to maintain full portfolio transparency will also provide an effective additional mechanism for addressing any such potential conflicts of interest  in addition applicants do not believe the potential for conflicts of interest raised by the advisers use of the underlying indexes in connection with the management of the self indexing funds and the affiliated accounts will be substantially different from the potential conflicts presented by an adviser managing two or more registered funds both the act and the advisers act contain various protections to address conflicts of interest where an adviser is managing two or more registered funds and these protections will also help address these conflicts with respect to the selfindexing funds  each adviser and any subadviser has adopted or will adopt pursuant to rule  under the advisers act written policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the advisers act and the rules thereunder these include policies and procedures designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest among the selfindexing funds and the affiliated accounts such as cross trading policies as well as those designed to ensure the equitable allocation of portfolio transactions and brokerage commissions in addition the initial adviser has adopted policies and procedures as required under section a of the advisers act which are reasonably designed in light of the nature of its business to prevent the misuse in violation of the advisers act or the exchange act or the rules thereunder of material nonpublic information by the initial adviser or an associated person “inside information policy” any other adviser or subadviser will be required to adopt and maintain a similar inside information policy in accordance with the code of ethics  and inside information policy of each adviser and subadvisers personnel of those entities with knowledge about the composition of the portfolio deposit  will be prohibited from disclosing such information to any other person except as authorized in the course of their employment until such information is made public in addition an index provider will not provide any information relating to changes to an underlying indexs methodology for the inclusion of component securities the inclusion or exclusion of specific component securities or methodology for the calculation or the return of component securities in advance of a public announcement of such changes by the index provider the adviser will also include under item c of part  of its form adv a discussion of its relationship to any affiliated index provider and any material conflicts of interest resulting therefrom regardless of whether the affiliated index provider is a type of affiliate specified in item   to the extent the selfindexing funds transact with an affiliated person of the adviser or subadviser such transactions will comply with the act the rules thereunder and the terms and conditions of the requested order in this regard each selfindexing funds board of directors or trustees “board” will periodically review the selfindexing funds use of an affiliated index provider subject to the approval of the selfindexing funds board an adviser affiliated persons of the adviser “adviser affiliates” and affiliated persons of any subadviser “subadviser affiliates” may be authorized to provide custody fund accounting and administration and transfer agency services to the selfindexing funds any services provided by an adviser adviser affiliates subadviser and subadviser affiliates will be performed in accordance with the provisions of the act the rules under start printed page the act and any relevant guidelines from the staff of the commission applications for prior orders granted to selfindexing funds have received relief to operate such funds on the basis discussed above  the shares of each fund will be purchased and redeemed in creation units and generally on an inkind basis except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified below purchasers will be required to purchase creation units by making an inkind deposit of specified instruments “deposit instruments” and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive an inkind transfer of specified instruments “redemption instruments” on any given business day the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the deposit instruments and the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the redemption instruments will be identical unless the fund is rebalancing as defined below in addition the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the funds portfolio including cash positions  except a in the case of bonds for minor differences when it is impossible to break up bonds beyond certain minimum sizes needed for transfer and settlement b for minor differences when rounding is necessary to eliminate fractional shares or lots that are not tradeable round lots  c tba transactions short positions derivatives and other positions that cannot be transferred in kind  will be excluded from the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments  d to the extent the fund determines on a given business day to use a representative sampling of the funds portfolio  or e for temporary periods to effect changes in the funds portfolio as a result of the rebalancing of its underlying index any such change a “rebalancing” if there is a difference between the nav attributable to a creation unit and the aggregate market value of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments exchanged for the creation unit the party conveying instruments with the lower value will also pay to the other an amount in cash equal to that difference the “cash amount”  purchases and redemptions of creation units may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis rather than in kind solely under the following circumstances a to the extent there is a cash amount b if on a given business day the fund announces before the open of trading that all purchases all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash c if upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an authorized participant as defined below the fund determines to require the purchase or redemption as applicable to be made entirely in cash  d if on a given business day the fund requires all authorized participants purchasing or redeeming shares on that day to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are not eligible for transfer through either the nscc or dtc defined below or ii in the case of foreign funds holding nonus investments such instruments are not eligible for trading due to local trading restrictions local restrictions on securities transfers or other similar circumstances or e if the fund permits an authorized participant to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are in the case of the purchase of a creation unit not available in sufficient quantity ii such instruments are not eligible for trading by an authorized participant or the investor on whose behalf the authorized participant is acting or iii a holder of shares of a foreign fund holding nonus investments would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind  creation units will consist of specified large aggregations of shares eg  shares and it is expected that the initial trading price per individual share will range from  to  all orders to purchase creation units must be placed with the distributor by or through an “authorized participant” which is either  a “participating party” ie a broker or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the nscc a clearing agency registered with the commission or  a participant in the depository trust company “dtc” “dtc participant” which in either case has signed a participant agreement with the distributor the distributor will be responsible for transmitting the orders to the funds and will furnish to those placing such orders confirmation that the orders have been accepted but applicants state that the distributor may reject any order which is not submitted in proper form  each business day before the open of trading on the listing exchange each fund will cause to be published through the nscc the names and quantities of the instruments comprising the deposit instruments and the redemption instruments as well as the estimated cash amount if any for that day the list of deposit instruments and redemption instruments will apply until a new list is announced on the following business day and there will be no intraday changes to the list except to correct errors in the published start printed page list each listing exchange will disseminate every  seconds during regular exchange trading hours through the facilities of the consolidated tape association an amount for each fund stated on a per individual share basis representing the sum of i the estimated cash amount and ii the current value of the deposit instruments  transaction expenses including operational processing and brokerage costs will be incurred by a fund when investors purchase or redeem creation units inkind and such costs have the potential to dilute the interests of the funds existing shareholders each fund will impose purchase or redemption transaction fees “transaction fees” in connection with effecting such purchases or redemptions of creation units in all cases such transaction fees will be limited in accordance with requirements of the commission applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities since the transaction fees are intended to defray the transaction expenses as well as to prevent possible shareholder dilution resulting from the purchase or redemption of creation units the transaction fees will be borne only by such purchasers or redeemers the distributor will be responsible for delivering the funds prospectus to those persons acquiring shares in creation units and for maintaining records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it in addition the distributor will maintain a record of the instructions given to the applicable fund to implement the delivery of its shares  the trust will submit an application to list the shares of each fund on an exchange it is expected that one or more member firms of an exchange will be designated to act as a market maker each a “market maker” and maintain a market for shares trading on the exchange prices of shares trading on an exchange will be based on the current bidoffer market transactions involving the sale of shares on an exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional investors and arbitrageurs market makers acting in their roles to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for the shares may from time to time find it appropriate to purchase or redeem creation units applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional and retail investors the price at which shares trade will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the option continually to purchase or redeem shares in creation units which should help prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav  shares will not be individually redeemable and owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only to redeem an investor must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit redemption requests must be placed through an authorized participant a redeeming investor may pay a transaction fee calculated in the same manner as a transaction fee payable in connection with purchases of creation units  neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised or marketed or otherwise held out as a traditional openend investment company or a “mutual fund” instead each such fund will be marketed as an “etf” all marketing materials that describe the features or method of obtaining buying or selling creation units or shares traded on an exchange or refer to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and will disclose that the owners of shares may acquire those shares from the fund or tender such shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only the funds will provide copies of their annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial owners of shares applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act under section dj of the act for an exemption from sections da and b of the act and under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of section d if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the owner upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the funds to register as openend management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may purchase shares in creation units and redeem creation units from each fund applicants further state that because creation units may always be purchased and redeemed at nav the price of shares on the secondary market should not vary materially from nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is currently being offered to the public by or through an underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a start printed page price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in a funds prospectus and not at a price based on nav thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c  under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been designed to a prevent dilution caused by certain riskless trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c ensure an orderly distribution of investment company shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve a fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of third party market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the price at which shares trade will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the option continually to purchase or redeem shares in creation units which should help prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium in relation to their nav section e  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants state that settlement of redemptions for foreign funds will be contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the united states market but also on current delivery cycles in local markets for underlying foreign securities held by a foreign fund applicants state that the delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring redemption instruments to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules may require a delivery process of up to fourteen  calendar days accordingly with respect to foreign funds only applicants hereby request relief under section c from the requirement imposed by section e to allow foreign funds to pay redemption proceeds within fourteen calendar days following the tender of creation units for redemption  applicants believe that congress adopted section e to prevent unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants propose that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a foreign fund to be made within fourteen calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants suggest that a redemption payment occurring within fourteen calendar days following a redemption request would adequately afford investor protection  applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to foreign funds that do not effect creations and redemptions of creation units inkind section d  section da of the act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring securities of an investment company if such securities represent more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company or together with the securities of any other investment companies more than  of the total assets of the acquiring company section db of the act prohibits a registered openend investment company its principal underwriter and any other brokerdealer from knowingly selling the investment companys shares to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than  of the acquired companys voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the acquired companys voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally  applicants request an exemption to permit registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts “uits” that are not advised or sponsored by the adviser and not part of the same “group of investment companies” as defined in section dgii of the act as the funds such management investment companies are referred to as “investing management companies” such uits are referred to as “investing trusts” and investing management companies and investing trusts are collectively referred to as “funds of funds” to acquire shares beyond the limits of section da of the act and the funds and any principal underwriter for the funds andor any broker registered under the exchange act to sell shares to funds of funds beyond the limits of section db of the act  each investing management company will be advised by an investment adviser within the meaning of section aa of the act the “fund of funds adviser” and may be subadvised by investment advisers within the meaning of section ab of the act each a “fund of funds subadviser” any investment adviser to an investing management company will be registered under the advisers act each investing trust will be sponsored by a sponsor “sponsor”  applicants submit that the proposed conditions to the requested relief adequately address the concerns underlying the limits in sections da and b which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds excessive layering of fees and overly complex fund structures applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  applicants believe that neither a fund of funds nor a fund of funds affiliate would be able to exert undue influence over a fund to limit the control that a fund of funds may have over a fund applicants propose a condition prohibiting a fund of funds adviser or sponsor any person controlling controlled by or under common control with a fund of funds start printed page adviser or sponsor and any investment company and any issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act that is advised or sponsored by a fund of funds adviser or sponsor or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with a fund of funds adviser or sponsor “fund of funds advisory group” from controlling individually or in the aggregate a fund within the meaning of section a of the act the same prohibition would apply to any fund of funds subadviser any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the fund of funds subadviser and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for sections c or c of the act or portion of such investment company or issuer advised or sponsored by the fund of funds subadviser or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the fund of funds subadviser “fund of funds subadvisory group”  applicants propose other conditions to limit the potential for undue influence over the funds including that no fund of funds or fund of funds affiliate except to the extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to a fund will cause a fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an underwriting affiliate “affiliated underwriting” an “underwriting affiliate” is a principal underwriter in any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor of the fund of funds or a person of which any such officer director member of an advisory board fund of funds adviser or fund of funds subadviser employee or sponsor is an affiliated person except that any person whose relationship to the fund is covered by section f of the act is not an underwriting affiliate  applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees the board of directors or trustees of any investing management company including a majority of the directors or trustees who are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act “disinterested directors or trustees” will find that the advisory fees charged under the contract are based on services provided that will be in addition to rather than duplicative of services provided under the advisory contract of any fund in which the investing management company may invest in addition under condition b a fund of funds adviser or a fund of funds trustee or sponsor as applicable will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the fund of funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a fund under rule b under the act received from a fund by the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or an affiliated person of the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor other than any advisory fees paid to the fund of funds adviser trustee or sponsor or its affiliated person by a fund in connection with the investment by the fund of funds in the fund applicants state that any sales charges andor service fees charged with respect to shares of a fund of funds will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds as set forth in nasd conduct rule   applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure applicants note that no fund will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section c or c of the act in excess of the limits contained in section da of the act except to the extent permitted by exemptive relief from the commission permitting the fund to purchase shares of other investment companies for shortterm cash management purposes to ensure a fund of funds is aware of the terms and conditions of the requested order the fund of funds will enter into an agreement with the fund “fof participation agreement” the fof participation agreement will include an acknowledgement from the fund of funds that it may rely on the order only to invest in the funds and not in any other investment company  applicants also note that a fund may choose to reject a direct purchase of shares in creation units by a fund of funds to the extent that a fund of funds purchases shares in the secondary market a fund would still retain its ability to reject any initial investment by a fund of funds in excess of the limits of section da by declining to enter into a fof participation agreement with the fund of funds sections a and  of the act  sections a and  of the act generally prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” of another person to include a any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person b any person  or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with the power to vote by the other person and c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company and provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns more than  of a companys voting securities the funds may be deemed to be controlled by the adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other in addition the funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by an adviser or an entity controlling controlled by or under common control with an adviser an “affiliated fund” any investor including market makers owning  or holding in excess of  of the trust or such funds may be deemed affiliated persons of the trust or such funds in addition an investor could own  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more affiliated funds making that investor a secondtier affiliate of the funds  applicants request an exemption from sections a and a of the act pursuant to sections c and b of the act to permit persons that are affiliated persons of the funds or secondtier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or in excess of  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds b an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in a or c holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more affiliated funds to effectuate purchases and redemptions “inkind”  applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting such affiliated persons from making “instart printed page kind” purchases or “inkind” redemptions of shares of a fund in creation units both the deposit procedures for “inkind” purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for “inkind” redemptions of creation units will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions regardless of size or number there will be no discrimination between purchasers or redeemers deposit instruments and redemption instruments for each fund will be valued in the identical manner as those portfolio holdings currently held by such fund and the valuation of the deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be made in an identical manner regardless of the identity of the purchaser or redeemer applicants do not believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching but rather assert that such procedures will be implemented consistently with each funds objectives and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will be made on terms reasonable to applicants and any affiliated persons because they will be valued pursuant to verifiable objective standards the method of valuing portfolio holdings held by a fund is identical to that used for calculating “inkind” purchase or redemption values and therefore creates no opportunity for affiliated persons or secondtier affiliates of applicants to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of shares of that fund similarly applicants submit that by using the same standards for valuing portfolio holdings held by a fund as are used for calculating “inkind” redemptions or purchases the fund will ensure that its nav will not be adversely affected by such securities transactions applicants also note that the ability to take deposits and make redemptions “inkind” will help each fund to track closely its underlying index and therefore aid in achieving the funds objectives  applicants also seek relief under sections c and b from section a to permit a fund that is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of a fund of funds to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds and to engage in the accompanying inkind transactions with the fund of funds applicants state that the terms of the transactions are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching applicants note that any consideration paid by a fund of funds for the purchase or redemption of shares directly from a fund will be based on the nav of the fund applicants believe that any proposed transactions directly between the funds and funds of funds will be consistent with the policies of each fund of

the investment policies set forth in the fund of funds registration statement applicants also state that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the act and are appropriate in the public interest applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions a etf relief  the
