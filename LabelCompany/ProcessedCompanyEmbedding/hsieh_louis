and cfo louis hsieh please sir louis hsieh yeah thank you sisi hello everyone and thanks for joining us today i apologies if i sound not clear i have a sore throat so you have to excuse my voice during the second quarter revenue increased  compared to  in the previous quarter this increase and accelerated recovery was mainly driven by strong performance of student enrollment in academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses which grew a total of  yearoveryear to approximately  one of the key segments  one of our key segment ucan business saw an increase of approximately  in student enrollment this is encouraging in the second quarter is traditionally slow for our business and we have moved path  moving away from the uncertainty surrounding the gaokao reform which we discussed in detail last quarter i would also like to add that beginning the middle of the second quarter the company decided to implement a new customer royalty program to encourage repeat business and this has resulted in deferred revenue of about  million which is expected to be recognize within two years without additional expenses associated with such revenues so in concluding this our topline growth would have been as high as  this is common factors in the education service market in china as it may  is a way to retain customers we consider it is necessary for us to sustain customer loyalty and maintain competitiveness under the new program when customers purchase academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses they will be able to earn points that are worth  to  of their total spending which can be used to pay for their tuition fees over the next two years so now this is temporary dampening quarterly revenue this revenue deferred are expected to be recognized when the points are redeemed in the associated classes are taken or when the points expired after two years without additional expenses associated with such revenues so essentially that revenue will fall to the ebit line  over the course of two years also in the second quarter as scheduled we started to rollout the revamp pop kids program and our new offerings have reached  cities across our nationwide school network our efforts are starting to payoff as pop kids recorded sequentially strong revenue performance and enrollment growth of more than  for the second half of fiscal  we will continue with the rollout expect to see a reverse of revenue decline to accommodate the late timing of chinese new year which will fall on february   we reduced class hours in some cities to fill in two terms of courses within the winter break which hurt our asps overall growth of asps was  yearoveryear breaking it down asp of ucan decreased by  yearoveryear due to class length reductions of  to  asp of pop kids program was flat as we have shortened class length on an hourly basis when asps grew between  and  depending on business line and location now i’d like to walk you through our performance across individual business lines our k allsubjects afterschool tutoring business continued to be our key revenue driver as recorded gross revenue growth of    sorry yearoveryear for the second fiscal quarter ucan middle and high school allsubjects afterschool tutoring business achieved a gross revenue increase of approximately  yearoveryear daily enrollments grew approximately  yearoveryear as mentioned before the pop kids program has previously been experiencing slower growth due to the revamp process as we started the nationwide rollout of the second quarter we have been sequentially seen improvement in revenue performance revenues declined low to  compared to decrease of  in the previous quarter enrollment growth was also strong reaching more than  we expect the strong momentum of our k afterschool business will continue which is important as we move toward peak season in the second half of fiscal year with the newly revamp pop kids program we are confident that the k afterschool tutoring business will continue to lead our growth in both revenues and enrollment as we might be pioneered with the strong brand recognition and innovative capabilities we are wellpositioned in the ever growing education services market in china our overseas test prep and consulting businesses together achieved revenue growth of more than  yearoveryear for the second fiscal quarter finally the vip personalized classes business recorded a continuous strong revenue growth of  yearoveryear in the second fiscal quarter turning to the balance sheet new oriental deferred revenue balance which is cash collected from registered student for courses and recognized proportionally as revenues has been instructions are delivered at the end of the second fiscal quarter  was  million an increase of  compared to  million at the end of the second quarter fiscal year  now id like to turn the call over to stephen yang our vp of finance to discuss strategy execution and progress and key financials stephen stephen yang thank you louis hello everyone as mentioned previously starting at the beginning of the fiscal year we embark on the new strategy of optimize the market transitioning to a focus on maintaining a healthy balance between topline and bottomline growth as well as meeting the growing demands for online education services in china we continue to be at the forefront of the mobile internet online learning with the significant investment in rd also installation of largest digitalized content library or call it as educational course and tools in china during the quarter we made significant progress in effort overall and we worked quickly building out our online and offline integrated educational ecosystem let me first talk a brief about the four of our business and our focus on further driving our offline user kits as we focus again aggressively increasing the topline we continued our effort to penetrate existing markets where we can optimize resources in the second quarter we opened  new schools and learning centers and closed the  adding net of two in the first two quarters of fiscal year  we added net of the  learning centers in december we added net of the eight learning centers we have added net of  new learning centers yeartodate bringing our total learning centers at the end of the calendar year  to  expand some existing learning centers adding a total of about  square meters of additional classroom area that are driving both revenue growth and margin expansion turning to the execution of our growth strategy again i can’t emphasize enough the great potential we see in mobile and joint online education market in china and more importantly our hard work and investment in new phase online oriental business will further distance us from existing competitors due to lack of financial resources and scale to make such investments difficult we are making solid progress in all three levels of our online in entire quarter the first level indiscernible of our online system is an oo twoways interactive education system across all our business lines the second level is our pure online learning platform koolearncom and supplementary online education products under the new oriental brand the third level of our ecosystem is for new oriental to take minority shareholdings in our education companies that complement our own online education offering now let me get into the details that we achieved on each levels as mentioned before we invested above  million to  million in this fiscal year and for the second quarter we spent about  million which were recognized as operating costs and the expenses lets start with the oo twoway interactive education system which we’ve rolled out and upgraded since the fourth quarter across all major product lines and increased expenses in new oriental traditional offline classroom teaching offerings to online education services we launched the ucan visible progress teaching system in over  cities since september last year this is our online platform that support after class selflearning and we expect this to have us better retain customers at the end of the third quarter we target expansion to  cities as said earlier in second quarter we successfully rolled out newly revamped pop kids english program shuang you which offers  multicultural experience based on the students own interest it has started to gain tractions in both our student enrollment and revenue for the second quarter we also rolled out oo twoway interactive education system for domestic test prep program we ceased the opportunity where we thought it was the right timing and now it’s being used in five cities in the first quarter we rolled out oo over two test app program for the second level of our online education ecosystem we’ve achieved a great outcome with our continued investment in koolearncom and other supplementary online education product in the second fiscal quarter koolearncom has generated net revenue of  million representing a  increase yearoveryear remember the registered users have increase of  yearoveryear and noncumulative registered users have reached over  million by the end of the third fiscal quarter koocn our own live broadcast open platform for both new oriental and thirdparty teachers achieved about  registrations in the second fiscal quarter of  donut a series of gamebased mobile learning applications for children achieved a record of  million downloads by the end of the second quarter le ci an english language vocabulary training application we launched in fourth fiscal quarter  for mobile phones and tablets app recorded over  users by the end of second fiscal quarter as announced in december last year we partnered with tencent and launched a mobile app named uda this is an exciting initiative as it brings together china’s most respected brand in kindergarten to college private education and its largest and most successful internet company this is another start that we made on the path of transforming how students in china will learn academic tutorials and we hope to create more bestinclass mobile learning solutions for students in china turning to the third level of our online education ecosystem we have invested in the select online education companies with the minority stake and we never ceased to search for new business opportunities that we can leverage so that we have numerous ph products and services in december  we made investments in indiscernible an online platform where our k students can practice our english it’s firmly being used by approximately  elementary schools and middle schools in more than  cities we’ve about  million registered users and  paid users together with our previous investment in alocom tarena and jueshengcom we’ve built more compensation online education system that is enabling us to provide fresh and interest to learning experience to our student all of this said i think it’s clear that the company has been working vigorously to drive both core offline and developing online business it is very encouraging that our highest potential business lines maintain healthy growth in the second quarter and we’ve made so much progress in building out our integrated education ecosystem and this yields strategic transition fiscal  is an important investment year and while this will have an impact on our annual operating margin and net income we do believe that this effort will bear fruit and help us to achieve the fulfillment of growth and longterm profitability now let’s take a quickly glance at some of the key financial metrics for the second fiscal quarter in addition to the financials we mentioned at the beginning of the call operating cost expenses for the quarter were  million a  increase yearoveryear nongaap operating costs and expenses for the quarter which exclude sharebased compensation expenses were us million representing a  increase yearoveryear cost of revenues increased by  yearoveryear to us million primarily due to the increases in teachers’ compensation which is in line with the revenue growth selling and marketing expenses increased by  yearoveryear to us million primarily due to increases in selling and marketing staff’s compensation and brand promotion expenses general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased by  yearoveryear to us million nongaap general and administrative expenses which exclude sharebased compensation expenses were us million sic us million representing a  increase yearoveryear primarily due to headcount increase total sharebased compensation expenses which were allocated to related operating costs and expenses decreased by  to us million in the second fiscal quarter of  in this fiscal quarter we encountered a loss from operations of us million compared to an income of us million in the same period of the prior fiscal year loss from operations would have been approximately us million is now for the accounting fact after accounting new customer loyalty programs nongaap loss from operations for the quarter was us million compared to nongaap income from operations of us million in the same period of the prior year operating margin for the quarter was negative  compared to  in the same period of the prior fiscal year nongaap operating margin which excludes sharebased compensation expenses for the quarter was negative  compared to  in the same period of the prior fiscal year net income attributable to new oriental for the quarter was us million representing a  decrease from the same period of the prior fiscal year capital expenditures for the quarter were us million which were primarily attributable to the opening of  new learning centers and renovations at older existing learning centers now let me go through our expectations for the third fiscal quarter of  before we move into qa section we expect total net revenue in the third fiscal quarter of  to be in the range of  million to  million representing yearoveryear growth in the range of  to  there were some specific factors impacting our guidance first approximately  million in revenue representing about  yearoveryear growth were deferred resulting from the companys new customer loyalty plans second the recent depreciation of renminbi against the us dollar and that impacts revenue growth by about  to  if not considering the above mentioned impact the projected revenue growth rate is expected to be in the range of  to  the above forecast reflects new orientals current and preliminary view which is subject to change at this point louis and i will take your questions operator please begin questionandanswer session operator thank you mr yang operator instructions and the first question comes from the line of jin yoon of mizuho securities asia please ask your question jin yoon hey good evening louis and the team can i start off with the loyalty program just kind of wondering what your thought process is why is the current program now is it largely due to competition or is it other external factors are really niche for this and really at the end of the day when we look at edu historically the company has kind of always piloted its entire higher quality higher caliber product that could continue to raise prices with the loyalty program did that kind of change how the company sees business going forward from historical norms can you just kind of elaborate on the loyalty program thanks louis hsieh sure thanks jin i think the loyalty program was sort of  we started it piloted in a couple cities in september and then we began and it was successful so we rolled out across the networks in october so it’s already been going on for a few months and you are right part of it is due to competition it’s also become a common practice in china i think it’s probably long overdue for us to have a loyalty program because remember our students start with pop kids at age five or six and stay for six years and they are willing to ask us for bundled breaks and this kind of stuff and so it makes sense for us to as we offer more classes like math in chinese for young kids to offer them some kind of discount as they signup for more classes and stay with us over a longer period of time and the key is to get them in seven grades so they will pass another transition period from sixth and seven grade and also in ten grade as they go into or actually when they go into high school so we wanted to in the marketing department decided it’s something we wanted to do to keep student retention high and also to sort of follow the norm of the market where a lot of companies do offer these loyalty programs and so we were part of this event by not doing it so part of it is the increased competition part of it is because we are seeing our campus growth in the k sector and these kids usually stay with us for multiple years so we want to create some stickiness by offering them loyalty to discounted loyalty program where they get discount and the longer they stay with us the more discount they get operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of alice yang of macquarie please ask your question alice yang hi louis sisi and stephen thank you very much for taking my question my question is about the oo integration initiatives especially the revamped pop kids can you share more color on the full year fy ’ growth of the pop kids segment if you can break into enrollment growth and asp growth that will be great and whether you can share some of your view about how you balance the asps further growth when your price is not very much cheap versus the comp volume growth especially in the less penetrated market thank you very much louis hsieh thank you good question for the pop kids program we just started rolling out the new program this last quarter so it’s in  cities but it’s probably only at about  to  of the total amount of pop kids learning centers so not fully rolled out yet but it is really encouraging the enrollment growth is accelerating so we did  enrollment growth last quarter and in the first five weeks of this quarter enrollment growth is already  and we are going into the next two weeks which is the fastest growth period for us because remember chinese new year is late this year it’s february th versus february th last year so the peak season for enrollment indiscernible now will be the next two weeks so if we continue this trend the pop kid enrollment actually did very well and i’d just like to add that ucan also did exceptionally well because enrollment is up over  in the first five weeks so we were seeing accelerated enrollment increase in k on asps we are taking the strategy of not increasing asps as much especially in this third quarter where we enrolled out a new program in pop kids and we have kind of squeezed two terms in before the chinese new year february th because it’s so late so the terms a little bit shorter so we are trying to so the prices won’t be i reckon is much of an increase but we are still increasing on hourly basis between  to  and then higher for overseas tests preps so it’s not much we are still increasing prices at above market rates and above what our competitors are but you are right i think it’s a gain that we want to get more enrollment especially enrollments in seventh grade and nine grade and ten grade when they are transitioning to junior high and they are transitioning to high school because then they have the best check of stay with us for two to four years and the idea is that the loyalty program will also create some stickiness in that regard alice yang so i want to ask another one please louis hsieh go ahead alice yang so yeah very much helpful so you mean that asp growth will be somewhere around  to  on average for full year fy ’ louis hsieh yes but we are still breaking parts on an hourly basis of about  for pop kids and up to  or  or  for ucan and then overseas is still over  so the price increase aren’t as quite as aggressive as past years but we were also seeing a nice spike in our enrollments because remember we had that terrible q during the summer and so we were still kind of recovering and we are rolling out a new pop kids program so the more early enrollments we get the more people will see how good the program is and with the loyalty program hopefully stay with us for many years so it’s kind of an integrated strategy to retain customers to get more new customers and introduce them to our new o offerings alice yang understand very helpful thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of vivian hao of deutsche bank please ask your question vivian hao hi louis sisi and stephen thank you for taking my question louis hsieh hi vivian vivian hao i first of all i have a followup question regarding the new loyalty program can you introduce what is the current redemption rate and also the average redemption period for such program and also do you have any plans to retain this program permanently or is it just for a certain period of time and i do have a second question sorry about this it’s regarding the hiring plan you operate now given the certain ga expenses what is the total headcount we have and also what is the additional headcount by function and also by segment for this quarter thank you louis hsieh okay i think stephen can tell you the breakdown but headcount is  at the end of the quarter which is about  more than last year of which  of them were teachers so the ga and sm and headcount did go up by about  which is a lot the growth predominantly we guided so far of  million centers net and so we have to expand the capacity as well but a lot of the headcount increase is related to the oo integration and the revamp of new programs i think that headcount will not go up by much in the next couple quarter but it will go up due to new center openings so i think you’ll probably lower by   reasonables stephen yang yes louis hsieh  is the regional goal for the end of this fiscal year on the royalty program vivian the current plan it to keep it in place permanently especially the early  our retention rate last quarter which is usually a slow quarter q was about  was over  so it’s a good retention rate but we don’t know how much has been redeemed yet because the gaokao just went into effect in october so the beginning redemptions will begin as you tracked about starting in this third quarter coming up but the idea is that the longer the student stays with us and the more classes they take the more discount they get so start to  and moves to  depending how long the student stays with us and the key is that it’s revenue like the  million that came in this last quarter only a half of quarter that  million is direct revenue if add it it would have been  on the gross side but all  million fall straight to ebit overtime because the cost it accounted in cost we delivered the classes right and so it’s pure revenue and pure operating market  operating income so that’s why it’s not applestoapples comparison with last year or in the past so we are beginning to star this new one so after one year when we expect about  million to  million of this deferred revenue about  million to  million per quarter and then it evens up the next year’s comparison will be sort of applestoapples so there will be a neutral effect and then the second year it should have a positive effect as some of these redemption points expired and they’re recognized right away so they were recognized as revenue and as profit right away so i think as you will see it  see some of it this year the revenue is dampened and the operating margins dampened  operating has dampened by about  million which is the three quarters’ worth and the next year it should be sort of neutral effect as we begin the yearoveryear comparisons it will be the same program and in the second year as the initial set begins to expire you will see a slight bump up in the second year in revenue and then in operating income but we intend to keep it permanently assuming it’s successful vivian hao right this is very helpful just a very quick clarification so as the deferred revenue one if flowing as  recognized as revenue on pl we should be expecting some positive impact to operating margins right louis hsieh correct so right now it’s going to be negative for this year so about  million negative for this year if we could take  million a quarter because we just started it after the first quarter and then next year because of the compare to yearoveryear with their all – their rate is in place they will become a neutral effect and then the second you will have a slight positive effect but the key to recognize is that this deferred revenue is real revenue if classes are already delivered revenues won’t be funded and it will just pass through the bottomline just at the rate of date vivian hao got it very helpful thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of philip wan of morgan stanley please ask your question philip wan hi thanks for taking my question just a followup question on your guidance given that you mentioned enrollment is rebounding including pop kids and asp is also growing i know that there is couple factors citing this with the loyalty program and the currency impact but the guidance   still a bit soft since the bps are soft could you talk about the overall enrollment trend the past few months and then also given the weaker first half what is your expectation on the full year margin that’s my question thank you stephen yang okay thanks a lot i think the last two month’s trend is quite good so we had  enrollment growth last quarter which a lot of it will flow in this quarter and then it’s hard to tell what this quarter will look like because the  days difference that you had in your last year and this year versus february th so we already past our peak period for last year already week wise this year it’s february  we were entering the peak period the next two weeks so if you don’t take the last week into account enrollments were up over  but you had number that enrollments in ucan and pop kids the hours have been shortened a little bit because of higher  two terms into winter break before time last year we didn’t try to do that and so that they are little bit shorter but the average hourly increase is still  to and that’s what we tried to explain in this script itself okay so there are still price increases and enrollments are actually still growing very fast so pop kids will enjoy very strong positive revenue increase as well as enrollment increase this quarter and ucan well over  so they are both doing very well the weakness is in the adult english it’s down about  in enrollments yearoveryear so that’s the weakness factor in the value terms it’s the old legacy business and overseas is down a little bit in enrollments this quarter but like i said it’s too early to tell because the next weeks are the key weeks for this year because if you’re looking at a score now and the sign up for the winter term over the next two weeks it will be the peak time but we are quite encouraged as far as margin goes we are still up last year we did  points it was in operating margin this year we had got to be  to  but with the new loyalty program it will take that down about  to  percentage points so it is up  million this year so it will be  we probably got somewhere but we don’t like to get straight at it because the lower we are going to knew but probably somewhere without the loyalty program about  to  but it’s down  percentage point and with the loyalty program we will probably look more like  to  so with that that’s why i want to start with or without loyalty program because otherwise it’s not a fair comparison but don’t forget this includes over  million of spend this year on the new online initiatives and then we expect that to really bear fruit in the second half of this year and into next year if we want to have the same  million increase next year so most of the expenses are coming in this year as we roll out oo across the whole network philip wan okay just want to make sure i get it right so including everything loyalty from investment so you are targeting around  to  this year for full year stephen yang yes with everything built in which is equivalent to about  to  preloyalty program philip wan okay thank you stephen yang okay tank you philip operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of ella ji of oppenheimer please ask your question ella ji thank you for taking my question first i have a quick followup regarding the loyalty program just want to make sure louis you said that the order points are they going to expire after one year is that what you said louis hsieh two years ella ji two years okay louis hsieh they will expire after two years ella so that’s why you will see this year there is lot of revenue to build up that will be either redeemed in the next two years or it will expire and will recognize at all that’s why in the second year the points in our redeemed will get recognize that’s why you see a bump up in the second year ella ji right okay louis hsieh but then revenues have been collective and it will fall a  to the operating line ella ji right got it and regarding uda your new product with tencent can you talk about your expected progress in the calendar year  and how much more support should we expect from tencent especially from tencent channels and do you think your rental will also need to spend more in sales and marketing to help promote uda product louis hsieh yeah that’s a good question uda is new so in kind of test launch with english so right now it’s a soft launch it hasn’t been blown out across qq or weixin yet we are waiting to add the math module so that will happen in the next few months and also we are testing it to make sure it’s more accurate the question answering program is more accurate and so we are continuing improving it but we want to do a soft launch to get it on the market so students begin to test it and help us to improve it this will be a longterm program that will include not just english and math but hopefully all the subjects from gaokao so it will become  we believe it will become we go to program for kids middle and high school for sure and tencent is behind it we will require additional investment and you will see it come in in the quarters ahead but i think you just stay tuned we are actually very excited about this and i think so is tencent and you will see a number of announcements from us in the near future on our corporation but again we are going to go and do test ella ji okay all right okay louis hsieh this is  at this point i want to make ella this is the beginning of our corporation this is not went and done this is a longterm corporation operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of trace urdan of wells fargo securities please ask your question trace urdan thanks very much so louis my understanding was with pop kids the plan was following the upgrade that you’re going to have much more pricing power and now it sounds like you’ve revised that expectation and so i’m looking at that data point combined with the fact that you chose this quarter to introduce the loyalty program and i’m wondering if you were now seeing pressure in the market  in the consumer market that and whether or not you believe that that sort of temporary related to the economic conditions in china right now or whether this is something related to growth in the large markets and approaching saturation and if this is sort of an environment that’s going to pass or something we can expect longterm louis hsieh it’s a good question trace i think for us the kids business has always been the most competitive on the pop kids and the reason is because as i  as you know if  you’re not studying for admission critical exam like the gaokao the indiscernible the sat so pricing has always been a little bit more difficult that’s why the pop kids class is only about a rmb versus a ucan classes more than rmb right for the same length of time so it’s because of the admission criticalness of this class itself and so pop kids has always been more competitive and for us we have always been at the highend of the pricing point and we have probably lost the market share as a lot of competitors come in because we  is not a hugely differentiated product but what we’ve done with this new relaunches we now have a differentiated product we have the best program out there that’s interactive it has interactive blackboard it’s far better than everything out there and i think it’s for us we want to introduce it to as many student as we can early because of the repeat business that it generates where they come in for many years and so this is aggressive portion in our part especially giving the pop kids was declining for three quarters in a row to get market share by getting new  more students in the market is not shrinking the pop kids market is still growing it’s growing nicely it just that we had an old offering and we won’t aggressively promoting it now we have the new offering the best offering in the market and we’re aggressively promoting it and we believe with the loyalty program it will keep students coming back they’ll have incentive and we won’t be that much more expensive than the other offerings part of the shift also trace is because we have a new pop kids head as you know they came in about four or five months ago and he  his philosophy and he knows better than i do is to go after market share first and then raise prices as the student get hooked on your product basically because there is really nothing else out there that’s comparable maybe busiest program but that’s two or three times our price trace urdan do you  are you so okay that i guess you answered my second question louis hsieh so first indiscernible get market share and then raise price trace urdan right so i guess given that you no longer  pop kids no longer the price leader in the market louis hsieh it is still the price leader but i mean disney has really been higher than us right but they’re owing a few market and they are at the ridiculous price point trace urdan okay louis hsieh i mean we’re at pop kids is about us us they are at in a  so there is a large  there is a huge discrepancy where we can still raise prices but i think for us right now given that we saw three consecutive quarters of decline and now we have the best product in the market in our price category we want to get market share first and it’s been successful right we saw  increase in enrollment and we spend the decline in revenue this quarter and just in the first five weeks we’re seeing almost  increase in enrollments that’s unheard off for pop kids in the last couple of years trace urdan yeah okay louis hsieh so the new program is taking hold and in ucan is doing the same thing we haven’t been as aggressive in ucan pricing this last quarter and you saw a huge spike  enrollment  in revenues because their courses are shorter and you can see continuation in this third quarter we’re already in the first five weeks before the peak season enrollments already up  trace urdan okay louis hsieh okay thank you trace operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of tian hou of th capital please ask your question tian hou hi louis stephen and sisi the question related to what you guided earlier this year regarding your oo investment at about  million to  million so i wonder how you guys are using this  million to  million why are you investing in this part of money so how much of that are like onetime investment how much of that is going to low into next year so i tried to figure out how much of that will disappear next year to improve your margin louis hsieh okay stephen has a better idea of that breakout but my only comment on this is that you know michael whatever budget he said will be over spent so i think it will be higher than  million partly closer to  million  million tian hou yeah louis hsieh you know the breakout stephen yang yeah hi tian we have spend us million on overall and online things the expenses in q and we will keep spend the  i think as amount like  million to  million in next two quarters by the end of this fiscal year i think we almost will finish the key spend of the overall and the expense so the next year you will not see so much expense as you’re seeing at this year and for the expense in the cut more than half of them we spend in the staff compensation because we heard more and more people for the it people to do the overall things and the others we spend in the  likely similar or the other equipments and for the pure online for our koolearncom we spend like  million for the selling expenses for the new product that’s the overall expense tian hou okay that’s helpful and also you guys have a lot of cash hello… louis hsieh go ahead tian hou hi louis so you guys have a lot of cash on your balance sheet and certainly you guys did not think about how to use that i wonder what’s the plan in that front louis hsieh well i think the cash the first idea or the first use will be looking at business partnerships and ma and also to make sure that we get this oo and we’re the leader in the online education and the onlineoffline integrated space in the mobile learning space that’s our first priority excess cash beyond now we will be using what we’ve been doing is buying back shares so we spent about  million so far in the first four month three or four month buying back shares in this coming program and then every year after the fourth quarter we look at how much cash we generated and we’ll either try to pay dividend or do share buyback or return some capital to investors depending on the need of our business and how much excess cash we generated tian hou that’s very helpful that’s all my question thank you louis hsieh thank you tian operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of jialong shi of credit suisse please ask your question jialong shi hi good evening management thanks for taking my question first of all a great followup on the previous question louis you just mentioned you will probably consider paying cash dividend or continue to do this share buyback for the coming fiscal years so if you guys were to pay dividends what is your target payout ratio you are making  can you give any guidance louis hsieh yeah we don’t have a target payout ratio but last year we paid about  million something in the dividend so you can calculate it’s about  or so a share and it’s up about  from a year before that this year we are doing a buyback but next year it depends on how much  we generated less cash this year than we did last year because of the investment it’s not my decision we don’t have a payout ratio but the board is considerate each year and actually in multiple board meetings throughout the year a return of capital we know it’s a big issue among us proxy bid so we are very sensitive to it and you know me i am always pushing to return capital back to the share holders jialong shi okay i guess a quick clarification on your dividend policy i understand for the current fiscal year you guys already have a share buyback program which you expected so is it fair to say for the current fiscal year you probably  you guys won’t have any dividend to announce even by q louis hsieh yeah i think that’s fair i think by q we may so it’s going in the few months so i think as we’ll make the decision after q so we’ll probably make it some time around the july board meeting as we did last and the year before jialong shi understand… louis hsieh so we finished the fiscal year so we did the budgeting for the next year jialong shi i see i see very clear yeah i have another question about your koolearn program and your koolearn appear to be very well in the past quarter excuse me just wonder what is the key competitive stage for koolearn compared to other online learning platforms especially those platforms operated by internet companies and what sort of revenue contribution would you expect to generate from koolearn by end of next fiscal year thank you louis hsieh yeah as we said in the script the koolearncom the growth  the revenue growth was very strong in the q about the  yearoveryear and last year the revenue of koolearncom accounts for the  of the total revenue but in the last  in the q it’s generated  the revenue accounts for the  of the total revenue so we are very happy to see that the revenue of the koolearn gets more and more growth so we hope the next year the revenue of the koolearn will get the growth rate by about  yearoveryear operator operator instructions and the next question comes from the line of clara fan of jefferies please ask your question clara fan thank you for taking my question i just want to clarify i mean for the last quarter we see that enrollment is growing while asp is cracked up and you mentioned that asp on a hourly basis is increasing by around  to  but on an absolute basis are we seeing a softer asp growth compared to what we have expected before especially after we introduced some loyalty programs thank you louis hsieh yes i think the intention of with michael and the marketing team and we agree with is to grow out the enrollment growth in a short term especially as we roll out oo we believe that our program is superior  far superior than anything else in the marketplace so we want as many students to try it as we can because we think we’ll get them hook so the shortterm plan is to reduce the amount of increase in the asp so we’ll still increase it by about  to  but it won’t be as aggressive as in past years because we want to get the students on this new online offline integrated system once they get on it we believe that along with the loyalty program it will create incredible stickiness and that also michael has spent a lot of time improving our content and improving our teaching quality so that’s where our focus has been so we believe that that compare with the technology advantage we have and the loyalty program and the brand name is the winning strategy for us so you are correct clara that we have slowed down the amount of asp increase but it’s still quite healthy at  to  which is not as high as  to  like in the past operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of fei fang of goldman sachs please ask your question fei fang hi louis sisi stephen can you help us with your expansion plan for  how many centers would you like to add this year which will focus on and which cities would you add the capacity thank you louis hsieh thank you fei i think we’ve opened  as of the first two quarters but we opened eight in december alone net so we were up at  now so i would expect that to be somewhere between  and  but far at the lower end of  to  so right on schedule we’re about  to  target we announced last quarter but probably not at the high end of that and most of the learning centers are kids k and overseas centers so they are kind of mix to use so we are not really opening adult centers given that’s the declining business and we are opening it in most of the cities that have higher profit margin so this still includes cities like beijing and shanghai and some of the largest cities some people may think it’s saturated but it’s not and then also high profit second tier cities like tangshan shiyan and some other cities wuhan that are doing quite well does that answer your question fei fang yes thank you for answering operator thank you and the next question comes from the line of jin yoon of mizuho securities asia jin yoon hey just a followup question do you want to add to the loyalty program from the release that you provide do you know how competitive your pricing is in select  in your top tier cities and if the pricing gap is still there between you and competitors does that mean that the potential rebate to go higher going forward thanks louis hsieh yes i think jin  i think yes right now as we go and adjust the rebate depending on market conditions our initial shot is  to  to go long enough the more years and the more classes you take with us the loyalty program goes up start to  and moves toward  of your total purchase so it does go up right now we always can adjust it higher or lower depending on market conditions right now we’re priced probably    to  above our competitors in most classes so that can give ucan pop kids overseas will probably represent higher than our most of our competitors we think that we’ll continue to hold because we use the other ones to initiate the price increases and they usually follow us behind us so we think unless there have been changes that price gap will continue to be in force but we think the difference now is that we believe the quality gap will expand so our quality and our internet tools in our mobile learning system will be better than anything else that our competitors can offer so not only will we have a pricing gap that looks same but we will have a higher quality gap that’s a goal so with a higher quality gap we’ll get more customers rolled in and at that point we will probably consider raising the price more aggressively jin yoon thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of charles cartledge of sloane robinson please ask your question charles cartledge hello stephen i’m cc thanks for taking the question about three quarters ago some of the debates or the conversation was about occupancy i was wondering if you could notwithstanding the fact that you calculate it maybe it’s worth reminding people how you calculate it but that will be interesting to seeing how that’s developed over the last few quarters please thank you louis hsieh thanks charles the utilization rate has continued to go up it’s probably up  yearoveryear but now we are adding more capacity so that may not be the case in q because we added eight learning centers in last month alone so we’ll keep you posted but the utilization rate is definitely up over the last two years about  percentage points from when we were at  learning centers and we were kind of backend loaded so i think is that you will continue to see the utilization rates go up but maybe not quite  a year because of the expected  the more aggressive expansion plan this year which is the contraction plan of last year but we’re definitely seeing more students filling the seats and in fact charles that we are being as aggressive on price i think we will also increase the utilization rate as well and the new programs are attracting as i said the enrollment growth is picking up so we  the new programs are attracting lot more students so you should see pretty good utilization rate increases but not quite as it was when we were reducing very fast charles cartledge thank you operator and the last question of this questionandanswer session just a followup question from the line of trace urdan of wells fargo securities please ask your question trace urdan thanks very much louis there was some coverage in december about plans to reform the gaokao this idea of sort of deemphasizing gaokao in favor of other measures of student achievements wonder if you can put that into some context for us whether you think that’s going to go forward what it means and whether it creates any opportunities for other types of sort of students support for you guys louis hsieh yeah i think there is a debate every year trace you are right we received a lot of writings about how it’s unfair that one test determines a child’s future so you always hear that kind of retract at the end of the day in a country with  million to  million high school graduates there is no fair way to assess people for a higher education for the limited spot but if china’s started looking at future recommendation letters the teachers would be the richest people in china right there is no fair way that we really can argue with other objective tests so all the retract that happens usually the gaokao still remains the main factor in fact it’s gotten rid of all the other stuff right they got rid of all the points you get for the olympic map and that’s what killing town in beijing and in the olympic side right it’s got rid of all the other external factors they’ve actually made the gaokao even more important and then of course earlier this year they talked about reducing the english points and they back off from that so english is the same as it was in past year and even helped us by taking the english test twice in shanghai than shuang you over the whole country so not only they come back they actually come back even stronger for english so i think there is talk every year of this but there is no  no ones come up with a fair system that people will accept other than the standardized test trace urdan okay that’s helpful thank you louis hsieh okay operator thank you all we are now approaching the end of this conference call i will now turn the call over to new orientals president and cfo mr louis hsieh for his closing remarks mr hsieh please go ahead
