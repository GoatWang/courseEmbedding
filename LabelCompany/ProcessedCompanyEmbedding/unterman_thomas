through a merger agreement tapulous became a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company reporting into disney interactive media group title board of trustees member company california institute of the arts job details calarts is implementing a new campus alert system that uses current cell phone voice mail and texting technology to inform the community in case of an emergency the system is provided by connected which is used by the major school districts in the santa clarita valley this system allows  emergency notification via cell phone text voice mail or email systems  studentstafffaculty notification on up to four phone numbers and two email addresses and  messages to be sent either from campus as well as remote locations student numbersemails were collected during registration in january staff and faculty information is currently being assembled once all of the information is collected and vetted we will be sending it on to connected for implementation we are hoping to test this new system in coordination with this semesters fire drill it is important that calarts maintain its unique creative environment while recognizing that outside forces must be addressed with a consistent and well defined safety plan it is our hope that these and future changes will add to the institutes overall safety and preparedness issues of living successfully with our own diversity have occupied many of the councils of the institute for the past two years and were the subject of our town hall meeting in the fall already more attention to these issues has been built into new student orientation and i think we can expect this component to grow over the next years there is i believe a growing attention to issues of diversity in the hiring of faculty which is reflected in a number of critical appointments over the past two years i hope you all saw the announcement that went our last week that a new personal counselor on the student affairs staff melissa shephard has experience in offering workshops in multiculturalism right now a job description for a new position as assistant provost for equity and diversity is working its way through the deans council and the academic council the holder of this position will be the point person in an institutewide effort to  encourage greater student faculty and staff understanding  to encourage sensitivity toward differences in cultural ethnic religious and sexual background and orientation and  to develop policies and programs that help prepare calarts students to live and act respectfully in a complex and diverse world and to take advantage of their own distinctive talents and resources in making their art thats a mouthful what it comes down to is that this persons job will be to wake up each day ready to work with all the councils of the institute in developing policies and procedures as well as in facilitating workshops and helping to strengthen attention to diversity in life and education at calarts having said all this i must also say that the pressures on next years budget are extraordinary in part because the board approved the smallest percentage increase in tuition in a decade from  to  or  right now in planning the budget a salary line has been included but we dont know yet where this process will end we may have to wait until midyear to hire someone but i hope not finally i want to turn to this issue of mentoring and academic counseling the student mentor relationship has at its best been one of the glories of calarts but right now the strength of mentoring varies considerably from school to school and department to department moreover traditionally this relationship has been focused on the students individual artmaking which is as it should be yet students also require counseling about requirements about what best to take outside their own school and about a host of other issues we dont yet have a solution for moving forward but we must develop one to ensure that every student has the optimal opportunity to make it through to graduation one step we have taken is to develop an atrisk students committee under associate provost john bache designed to identify any student who seems at risk academically behaviorally or in any other way and then to offer appropriate counseling this is a critical safety net but at the other end of the scale we must do everything possible to ensure that every student is able to take the best possible advantage of calarts thats a challenge this year and will be every year and so here is perhaps where i should stop to

media industryamong other things mr unterman has been critical of the companys efforts to develop internet businesses around its powerful local news franchises in cities like los angeles chicago hartford and baltimorethe tribune board and its chief executive dennis j fitzsimons have rejected the chandlers demands and have accused the chandlers of putting their own interests ahead of those of

illinformed photo thomas unterman a lawyer has been an adviser to the chandler family for many years credit rob delorenzosipa press and a more drastic revamping of tribune — like spinning off its tv

sell more than  percent into the sale without losing the seats but the board said noa person close to the chandlers who asked not to be identified because the family considers the matter confidential

former goldman sachs banker who worked as an adviser to times mirror and is president of the board of trustees of the los angeles museum of contemporary art where mr unterman is treasureri see him as a seeker of the right solution which could make some parties unhappy mr mesdag said i dont see him as a compromiser — i think hes quite comfortable with the right solution and a disgruntled partyone times mirror director at the time of the companys sale who was not affiliated with the chandlers described mr unterman as calm rational and personable another longtime times mirror director alfred e

approached the tribune company about a deal without the knowledge of his ostensible boss at the time times mirrors chief executive mark willesi think there was a kind of evil genius issue raised by

calling it hasty and illinformed photo thomas unterman a lawyer has been an adviser to the chandler family for many years credit rob delorenzosipa press and a more drastic revamping of tribune — like spinning off its tv business which the company said it has studied for months — is not feasible for tax reasons until the tmct partnerships are unwound advertisement continue reading the main story the chandlers would lose their three seats on the board if they tendered more than  percent of their shares into the buyback the chandlers asked the board several weeks ago if it would change its bylaws to allow them to sell more than  percent into the sale without losing the seats but the board said noa person close to the chandlers who asked not to be identified because the family considers the matter confidential said tribunes unwillingness to let the chandlers keep their board seats was not a factor in the trusts decision to oppose the buyback and not sell shares newsletter sign up

legal venture capital media and civic circles in los angeles people who know him depicted mr unterman as a good listener and negotiator but aggressive and unflinching once his mind is made uphe is solomonesque said willem mesdag a former goldman sachs banker who worked as an adviser to times mirror and is president of the board of trustees of the los angeles museum of contemporary art where mr unterman is treasureri see him as a seeker of the right solution which could make some parties unhappy mr mesdag said i dont see him as a compromiser — i think hes quite comfortable with the right solution and a disgruntled partyone times mirror director at the time of the companys sale who was not affiliated with the chandlers described mr unterman as calm rational and personable another longtime times mirror director alfred e osborne called him a very savvy and creative financial executive who could structure transactions superblymr untermans close ties to the chandlers gained attention when it emerged that he had approached the tribune company about a deal without the knowledge of his ostensible boss at the time times mirrors chief executive mark willesi think there was a kind of evil genius issue raised by some commentators after the episode said henry m fields a lawyer with morrison  foerster the law firm where mr unterman worked before joining times mirror as its general counsel in  hes no svengali i see him as an absolutely classic corporate lawyer and advocate for his clients who tries to do his bestmr unterman is something of a chicagoan himself he was born in rhode island but raised in chicago and attended law school at the university of chicago the venture capital fund he runs rustic canyon — in which tribune has a  percent economic interest — has lost
