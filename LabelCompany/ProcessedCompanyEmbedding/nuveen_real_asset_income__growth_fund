overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment

its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment

trade on an exchange nextshares may offer cost and tax efficiencies that can enhance shareholder returns bottom line nextshares are the next evolution of fund investing™ overview how do the costs of nextshares compare fund costs explained nextshares mutual funds and etfs are subject to different fund costs that impact investor returns what are distribution and service b fees fund payments to support the distribution of fund shares and the provision of shareholder services under rule b of the investment company act of  a fund’s b fees are typically paid to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares permitted b fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually mutual funds are often subject to b fees that vary by share class nextshares and most etfs do not pay b fees a fund’s b fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio what are transfer agency expenses the fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and b fees nextshares and etfs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses transfer agency fees are characterized as other expenses in a funds prospectus and are included in its total expense ratio what are flowrelated trading costs the trading costs a fund incurs to purchase and sell investments in connection with shareholder inflows and outflows including commissions bidask spread ie difference between the best offer price to sell a security and the best bid price to buy the security and market impact ie the effect of a purchase or sale of a security on its trading price costs flowrelated trading costs are not disclosed in a funds prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio nextshares keep flowrelated trading costs low by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind using securities and other noncash payments and by charging transaction fees to authorized participants professional investors who transact directly with the fund most mutual funds do not issue or redeem shares in kind or charge transaction fees what is cash drag the impact on fund performance of holding cash cash drag hurts fund performance when the returns of the funds noncash investments exceed cash returns and helps fund performance when the opposite is true cash drag is not disclosed in a funds prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio nextshares that transact with authorized participants primarily in kind may experience less cash drag than mutual funds which often need to hold cash to meet shareholder redemptions what is a fund’s total expense ratio ter a funds total annual expenses expressed as a percentage of the funds average net assets for the year as stated in its prospectus fund ters include management fees b fees custody charges transfer agency fees and other operating expenses of the fund ters do not include flowrelated trading costs or cash drag ters also do not reflect fund sales charges or other costs borne by buyers and sellers of shares compared to mutual funds that can be purchased and sold at net asset value nextshares and etfs may be more expensive to buy and sell compared to a mutual fund with the same strategy and portfolio management a nextshares fund can offer cost advantages that can translate into improved fund performance no distribution and service b fees unlike many mutual funds nextshares offer investors a single share class with no embedded distribution and service fees lower fund transfer agency expenses because nextshares are exchangetraded their transfer agency
