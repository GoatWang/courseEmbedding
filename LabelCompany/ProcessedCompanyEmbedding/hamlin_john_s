judges posner chief judge  the dickeyjohn corporation filed a suit against hamlin inc for breach of contract and breach of warranty the suit was eventually settled for  million and hamlin turned around and brought the present suit a diversity suit governed by wisconsin common law against two of its liability insurers actually three but two are affiliates and need not be distinguished to recover the  million hamlin charges that the two insurers breached their duty to defend it against dickeyjohns suit the district court granted hamlins motion for summary judgment awarding it the entire  million plus interest and attorneys fees even though it is plain that no part of hamlins liability to dickeyjohn is within the scope of the insurance policies  most liability insurance policies provide that if the insured is sued and asks its insurer to defend the suit the insurer must do so and it must do so the courts interpreting such policies hold unless it is plain from the complaint that the plaintiffs claims of liability are not covered by the policy unless that condition is satisfied the insurer will be deemed to have breached its duty to defend even if it should later be determined that the claims were indeed outside the coverage of the policy thus the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify that is to pay the insurance claim are not coextensive and the former being triggered by arguable as distinct from actual coverage and determined by what the complaint says rather than by the actual facts underlying the claim of liability is broader city of edgerton v general casualty co  wis d   nwd    atlantic mutual ins co v badger medical supply co  wis d   nwd   app  united states fire ins co v good humor corp  wis d   nwd   app  curtisuniversal inc v sheboygan emergency medical services inc  fd   th cir  applying wisconsin law  an insurance company that refuses a tender of defense by its insured takes the risk not only that it may eventually be forced to pay the insureds legal expenses but also that it may end up having to pay for a loss that it did not insure against if the lack of a defender causes the insured to throw in the towel in the suit against it the insurer may find itself obligated to pay the entire resulting judgment or settlement even if it can prove lack of coverage that is what happened in newhouse by skow v citizens security mutual ins co  wis d   nwd   and is the reason why an insurance company that wants to avoid liability for breach of the duty to defend will often seek a declaratory judgment of noncoverage to negate any inference of arguable coverage and hence of a duty to defend before the company has to decide whether to accept the tender of the defense  the district judge inferred from newhouse that an obligation to pay the entire settlement or judgment is the automatic consequence of a finding of a breach of the duty to defend dicta in newhouse and other cases interpreting the wisconsin common law of insurancecontract interpretation such as grube v daun  wis d   nwd   app  and our own carney v village of darien  fd   th cir  are consistent with this harsh view and holdings to this effect can be found in two wisconsin cases united states fire ins co v good humor corp supra  nwd at  and professional office buildings inc v royal indemnity co  wis d   nwd   app  but there is a contrary dictum in grube v daun supra  nwd at  while production stamping corp v maryland casualty co  nwd   wisapp  holds that a wrongful failure to defend will not estop the insurer to plead lack of coverage unless coverage is at least fairly debatable only newhouse is a case from wisconsins highest court moreoverand newhouse is explicit that the insured must show that he was made worse off by the breach than he would have been had the breach not occurred  nwd at  this is also the majority view  allan d windt insurance claims  disputes representation of insurance companies and insureds §  pp  d ed  and it is inconsistent with a rule of always forbidding the insurer that has wrongfully refused to defend the insureds case to deny coverage  in the present casea case of multiple insurers to which the dicta we have referred which assume that the insured is defending himself id §  p  do not speakanother of hamlins insurers not one of the defendants accepted the tender of the defense this insurer did not pay the entire bill for hamlins defense but neither is hamlin some hapless individual who could not afford a good defense unless his insurer or insurers picked up the full tab hamlin was defended by foley  lardner one of the best law firms in the united states had the insurance companies that are the present defendants helped pay foley  lardners bills hamlin would have benefited to the extent that the insurer which did accept the tender of defense did not cover those bills in their entirety but it would not have been better off to the tune of  million that would imply that if only the defendants had contributed to the cost of the defense dickeyjohn would have been sent packing without a cent though as far as we can tell its claims against hamlin were entirely valid valid or not hamlin couldnt have expected to do better than with foley  lardnerthe firm that was in fact its own choice and not a coerced choice that is not a choice to which it turned only because the obstinacy of the defendants made it unable to afford an even better firm if there is one  to award hamlin  million would thus be to give it a windfall and windfall damages are punitive in nature insurance companies that refuse in bad faith to honor their undertakings are liable for punitive damages weiss v united fire  casualty co  nwd   wis  marsh v farm bureau mutual ins co  wis d   nwd   app  as there is no basis for an inference of bad faith in this case the judgment awarded by the district court is inconsistent with wisconsins policy on punitive damages  indeed there never was even arguable coverage of hamlins liability to dickeyjohn and the insurance companies were therefore within their rights in declining to defend hamlin to see this we need to compare dickeyjohns complaint with the terms of the insurance policies according to the complaint hamlin manufactured and sold to dickeyjohn liquid crystal displays that dickeyjohn incorporated into instrument panels which it then sold to manufacturers of agricultural machinery the manufacturers in turn sold tractors incorporating the panels to farmers a number of the liquid crystal displays were defective and as a result the instrument panels did not work properly this was not discovered until the tractors containing the panels had been in use for some time the farmers filed warranty claims against the tractor manufacturers who in turn filed claims against dickeyjohn resulting in warranty and repair costs that dickeyjohn sought to shift to hamlin by means of its suit the suit charged breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties of merchantability hamlin was thus alleged to have sold defective goods causing its buyer to incur warranty and repair costs  is such liability within the arguable scope of either defendants insurance policies homes policy a standard commercial general liability policy covers liability for property damage this is defined as either physical injury to tangible property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured but there is an exclusion for your that is the insureds productand the only physical injury was to hamlins product the liquid crystal displays themselves when the displays were mounted in the instrument panels manufactured by dickeyjohn the panels would not work but there is no hint in the complaint that the panels were somehow physically injured by containing a nonfunctioning part  the policy also excludes liability for damage to impaired property that is property that has not been physically injured resulting from a defect in the insureds productwhich is an exact description of dickeyjohns claim dickeyjohn claimed that the defect in hamlins product had impaired its own product not by physically injuring it but by impairing its performance the defective liquid crystal displays were like a defective clock in an automobile the defect impairs the performance broadly conceived of the automobile it does not physically injure the automobile  there is an exclusion from the second of these exclusions impaired property for the case in which the insureds property is damaged in an accident if en route to dickeyjohn hamlins liquid crystal displays had been damaged in a traffic accident and as a result had become defective hamlins liability to dickeyjohn would have been covered by homes insurance policy after all but the complaint alleges that over a period of two years a great number of the lcd units provided by hamlin to dickeyjohn were defective and this allegation is inconsistent with an inference that the defective units became defective as the result of an accident to otherwise sound units  complaints are not always accurate so no one reading dickeyjohns complaint could have been certain that hamlins liability would not turn out to be of a sort covered by the insurance policy but certainty is not the test the test is whether the complaint arguably asserts a form of liability covered by the policy dickeyjohns does not neither the district court nor the insured is able to offer a plausible interpretation of the complaint that would bring its allegations within the scope of the liabilities that home insured hamlin against  the same is true with regard to hartfords policy though its wording is slightly different there is an exclusion for property damage to the named insureds product arising out of such products or any part of such products and this is the equivalent of the your product exclusion in homes policy the damage to the liquid crystal displays came from a defect in the product itself and was thus squarely within the exclusion there is also an impaired property exclusion no coverage for loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from  the failure of the named insureds products  to meet the level of performance quality fitness or durability warranted  by the named insured this again is an exact description of the loss that gave rise to dickeyjohns suit against hamlin dickeyjohns instrument panels became unusable as a consequence of a defect constituting a breach of warranty in hamlins product  other issues are raised but need not be discussed the judgment for hamlin is reversed with instructions to enter judgment for the defendants  reversed  ripple circuit judge concurring  i join the judgment of the court

were looking formagnifying glassdid you knowfinding an auto repair professionalthere are more than  auto service technicians and mechanics in the us finding the right one to repair a dent in your car door or fix an engine that wont start can be overwhelming especially when its an emergency review a few important facts about auto repair professionals and what you can do to get the best possible mechanic working on your vehicles issues for a fair pricelooking for reliability unlike home repair services that evaluate a property meet with homeowners and have time to prepare before their physical work begins auto repair businesses are often asked to make fixes on the spot if you come into a garage with a tire issue the expectation is the mechanic will know how to correct that problem quicklythat is why reliability is so vital when searching for a trusted auto repair shop it may take going to several different mechanics before you find one you are truly comfortable with pose questions to this professional to find out what approach they will take to repair your car or what alternatives are available shopping around also gives you the best opportunity to find the cheapest rate or the fastest service as some garages may be backed up with other vehicles that need repair firsta recommended way to locate a trustworthy auto repair professional is to seek out customer reviews online sites offer honest opinions from real customers who have used a business read through this feedback to learn how a business operates and what you can expect if you were to take your vehicle there look for reviews about how quick maintenance was completed and if prices were fair by learning what other people have said about a garage you can gain a better idea if its the right place to go when you have a car problem in need of fixingunderstanding when theres an issueit can be difficult to know which automotive problems are serious enough to require expert assistance a ripped seat cushion or broken radio dont involve safety and will not warrant enough of a problem that going into a garage is required however setbacks with brakes lights and other parts that are vital to the safety of your cars driver and passengers as well as others on the road necessitate quick fixes many modern automobiles will notify drivers of an issue in the form of a signal on the dashboard or a noise within the vehiclein the event of an accident even if your vehicle does not appear to have any damage on the outside it is generally recommended that you see a trusted auto repair professional internal damage may have occurred or an important part may have been knocked out of place fixing these issues before driving much further can prevent further vehicle breakdowns in the future in the case of a serious accident a body shop can assess the problems and determine the best course of action for repairs as well as evaluate how much they will costbeyond that regular checkups are recommended tires must be rotated fluids needs to be replaced and the engine must be evaluated after driving  miles most auto dealers suggest having the vehicle checked out to ensure everything is running smoothly taking the car into the auto repair professional you trust will protect you from further problems down the roaddoing your own auto repairnot every type of auto repair work needs to be done by a certified mechanic you can fix some of a vehicles issues just by paying attention to how the automobile is running and having a basic understanding of auto repair look over the ways weather may impact your car and what preventative measures you can take to avoid having to take it into the shop at the same time be aware of mechanic scams that can impact your experiencepreventing trips to the professional some fixes to your car can be done without paying a specialist issues like replacing oil and air filters are relatively simple with instructions provided in the owners manual on how to make these changes the same goes for replacing broken windshield wipers or burntout headlights such issues should be repaired quickly to guarantee safety but dont require a visit to a garage by handling these types of tasks on your own youll gain a better understanding for how your car operates and save time and moneyalong with understanding how to fix manageable vehicle issues that may arise taking preventative measures to avoid future problems is a valuable time saver many problemsolving best practices are related to the seasons your vehicle will be in different conditions in the winter than in the summer meaning it requires a different type of preparationin the spring and summer you want to be sure your air conditioner and cooling systems work correctly given the high temperatures the vehicle will be exposed to overheating is a common problem look over the system by ensuring there is enough coolant available if it needs to be refilled it is best to open the hood and add more to the car before it gets too warm out also clean out fan ducts and other ventilation sources necessary for summertime drivingfor winter driving features such as the defroster heater and exhaust system are paramount look in your owners manual for specific directions on how features should be checked and repaired many newer cars have a cabin air filter that can be replaced when needed allowing warm air to continue to flow in also check your tires before winter driving as they need to be at the proper pressure to perform well on snow and iceavoiding scams there is a common worry among many people that auto repair professionals take advantage of the general public because so many people are unaware of how to fix the problems in their vehicle they are nervous of being overcharged by mechanics or worried that the improper work is being donewhile the great majority of professionals in the industry are honest hardworking people a few bad apples can ruin everything you should be extra careful when first visiting a mechanic to guarantee that the price youre charged and maintenance the vehicle receives are fairamong the common scams pulled are needless repairs where a garage charges you for work that isnt necessary another popular one is attracting customers through a cheap oil change or tire pressure check then when you are in the shop and your car is being repaired they give you a long list of other corrections theyd like to make therefore boosting the total cost of your billthe best way to combat these types of problems is getting a written estimate before work is done that way you can see how much repairs are expected to cost if the final bill is higher than the estimate projected ask to specifically see the work make sure information is put in writing as well if a problem remains you can have proof that work was not done to your satisfactionby working closely with an auto repair professional and doing some of the tuneup work on your own you will be less likely to fall for these scams at the same time youll be able to drive out with a clean and healthy vehicle thanks to the repairs made by a trained professional we just redesigned ypcom
