transcript has just published its aerospace and defense report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives this special feature contains expert industry commentary through indepth interviews with public company ceos equity analysts and money managers the full issue is available by calling   or via the wall street transcript onlinetopics covered increased commercial aircraft production rate  defense budget uncertainty  aftermarket service growth deceleration  emerging markets air travel growth ratescompanies include aar air abb abb ana tyo aerovironment avav airbus eadpa and many morein the following brief excerpt from the  page  interviewees discuss the outlook for the sector and for investorspeter j gundermann was appointed the president and chief executive officer of astronics corporation in  previously he held the position of president of luminescent systems inc an operating subsidiary of astronics since  mr gundermann has been with astronics since  and a member of the board of directors since  he holds a ba in applied mathematics and economics from brown university and earned his mba from duke universitytwst please start by telling us a bit about the company a brief history of astronics and an overview of your business todaymr gundermann astronics atro has been a public company since the s over the years it has been involved in a number of different types of business but for practical purposes over the last decade we have been an aerospace company and thats how we consider ourselves today we report in two segments approximately  of our sales these days are aerospace related the remaining  is defense electronicstwst please tell us about the companys productsmr gundermann our aerospace product lines revolve primarily around lighting systems and electrical power generation and control the lighting systems are primarily cockpit related a lot of things light up in a cockpit similar to a car also like a car there are a lot of exterior lights on airplanes the red and green position lights most people are familiar with and there are also landing lights taxi lights and flashing anticollision lights then in the cabin there are a wide range of lights some of which are amenity related for the benefit of passengers but many of which are either safety related or service related for the crew on the electrical generation side probably our bestknown product is what i will call passenger power which allows passengers the option of plugging in their personal electronic devices so they can save their battery and operate their device off of airframe power the second avenue of our electrical products has to do with complete electrical systems for small aircraft primarily business jets  everything from the generators all the way up to the enduse systems were capable of providing complete systems to those types of airplanestwst who are your typical customers for thismr gundermann we do work with all the oems from the biggest airplanes down to the smallest airplanes we have products that are standard issue on the airbus a for example and we have products that are standard issue on a cessna  we span the industry we sell to the people who make airplanes and also sell to subsystem suppliers for example somebody who puts in a rockwell collins pro line  avionics suite gets astronics controls on the face of those devices we are also involved in the military market which i havent talked about yet just like we span the range of commercial airplanes we also span the range of military airplanes some of the more popular models talked about these days are the joint strike fighter we do work on the lighting side for lockheed on that airplane and on the b we do both power and lighting work on the boeing verticallift platformstwst do you see any demand trends from your customer basemr gundermann certainly i think the biggest trend affecting our business has been our success over the years with developing new products those who look at our history will find that we have grown pretty rapidly relative to the industry over the last  years the main driver for that growth has been our ability to develop new products that our customers find appealing as a result weve been successfully increasing our shipset content on new platforms as they are developed in other words a new airplane  say by cessna for example  tends to have quite a bit more content from astronics than the older model they are replacing so the biggest trend has been placing more shipset content and being responsible for bigger systems on new airplanes as they are developedtwst you mentioned earlier how sales at astronics are split between the two business segments  aerospace  defense electronics do you see that changing at allmr gundermann we are pursuing a number of opportunities for our defense electronics business to increase the significance of that business segment we are working diligently to that end but we certainly dont see us abandoning our aerospace orientation we consider ourselves an aerospace company we expect we will continue to consider ourselves an aerospace companythe wall

technology investingcompanies include astronics corp atro and many morein the following excerpt from the industrial equipment aerospace and defense report the president and ceo of astronics corporation atro discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industrytwst do any particular trends stand out for you that you are seeing among your customers whether it be overall demand need for new product development etcmr gundermann there are a number of trends but by far the biggest one driving our results is the trend whereby people are carrying increased numbers of personal electronic devices  iphones tablet computers fullup personal computers portables  onto airplanes and they want to use them when in flight and they want to use them in part to connect to the internetthere is wifi onboard thats another big trend so whereas at one point in the not too distant past people might have had one personal electronic device today they are increasingly carrying two three or four and whereas before it was kind of a luxury to have such a device now its almost a necessity depending on your line of work people need and want to be on the internet while they are on their flight so our inseat power product enables that combination of increased numbers of personal electronic devices and wifi this trend is definitely propelling our results into pretty good placestwst is that your empower product i believe youve had a few recent announcements regarding thatmr gundermann yes our trade name is empower weve announced some agreements primarily with panasonic our biggest customer panasonic is one of the leading inflight entertainment providers to the aerospace industry and they are a large customer of ours but we work with some airlines around the world we work directly with the airframe manufacturers boeing and airbus and we work with other ife suppliers tooand one of the realities of this part of the aerospace industry is that airlines ultimately make the decisions in terms of whether to use our product or not airlines are at the end of the day retailoriented organizations and are very reluctant to let us issue any kind of press release about any activity involving them whatsoever so even though its our biggest product line and even though we have pretty substantial growth over the last few years we cant for more of this interview and many
