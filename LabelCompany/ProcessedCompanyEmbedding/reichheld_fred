opportunities while this may be the case the lack of any easy way to automatically analyze the verbatim answers without human bias is problematic the response of many companies to the problem has been to add additional questions with rating scales additional questions can be included to assist with understanding the perception of various products services and lines of business these additional questions help a company rate the relative importance of these other parts of the business in the overall score this is especially helpful in targeting resources to address issues that most impact the nps companies using the net promoter system often rely on software as a service vendors that offer a full suite of metrics reporting and analytics– the primary purpose of the net promoter score methodology is to evaluate customer loyalty to a brand or companycitation needed the ability to measure customer loyalty is a more effective methodology to determine the likelihood that the customer will buy again talk up the company and resist market pressure to defect to a competitorcitation needed measuring loyalty can be done in several ways and researchers have asserted that there are better predictors of actual recommendations than asking likelihood to recommend since the purpose of net promoter is not to predict actual recommendations alone but to predict the full suite of financially advantageous behaviors proponents of the methodology do not find this troublesome– net promoter system also requires a process to close the loop closing the loop is a process by which the provider actively intervenes to learn more from customers who have provided feedback and also to change a negative perception often converting a detractor into a promoter– in order to do this the survey respondent can not be anonymous something that can have a negative impact in the willingness to take the survey or to give low gradescitation needed the net promoter survey will identify customers who need some followup including detractors and should automatically alert the provider to contact the consumer and manage the followup and actions from that point proponents of the net promoter approach claim the score can be used to motivate an organization to become more focused on improving products and services for consumers they further claim that a companys net promoter score correlates with revenue growth the net promoter approach has been adopted by several companies including australia post siemens eon philips– ge apple retail american express and intuit it has also emerged as a way to measure loyalty for online applications as well as social game products a customer is able to leave comments in the surveys sent to them this is what allows a company to use the voc voice of customer to ensure that company is meeting the expectationscitation needed some proponents of the net promoter score also suggest that the same methodology can be used to measure evaluate and manage employee loyalty they claim that collecting the feedback from employees in a manner similar to net promoter customer feedback can provide companies a way to maintain focus on their culture what is sometimes called the employee net promoter score or enps has been compared to other employee satisfaction metrics and some companies have claimed that it correlates well with those other metrics for some kinds of industries notably software and services it has been shown that detractors tend to remain with a company and passives leave this appears to be the case where switching barriers are relatively high in the face of criticisms of the net promoter score the proponents of the net promoter approach claim that the statistical analyses presented prove only that the recommend question is similar in predictive power to other metrics but fail to address the practical benefits of the approach which are at the heart of the argument reichheld put forth proponents of the approach also counter that analyses based on thirdparty data are inferior to analyses conducted by companies on their own customer sets and that the practical benefits of the approach short survey simple concept to communicate ability to follow up with customers outweigh any statistical inferiority of the approach interestingly they also allow that a survey using any other question can be used within the net promoter system

business growth than other customerloyalty questions eg overall satisfaction likelihood to purchase again specifically hayes stated that the likelihood to recommend question does not measure anything different from other conventional loyaltyrelated questions the customer metrics included in this study perform equally well in predicting current company performance nps uses a scale of low predictive

loading executive summary reprint rc companies spend lots of time and money on complex tools to assess customer satisfaction but they’re measuring the wrong thing the best predictor of topline growth can usually be captured in a single survey question would you recommend this company to a friend this finding is based on two years of research in which a variety of survey questions were tested by linking the responses with actual customer behavior—purchasing patterns and referrals—and ultimately with company growth surprisingly the most effective question wasn’t about customer satisfaction or even loyalty per se in most of the industries studied the percentage of customers enthusiastic enough about a company to refer it to a friend or colleague directly correlated with growth rates among competitors willingness to talk up a company or product to friends family and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer’s sacrifice in making the recommendation when customers act as references they do more than indicate they’ve received good economic value from a company they put their own reputations on the line and they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty the findings point to a new simpler approach to customer research one directly linked to a company’s results by substituting a single question—blunt tool though it may appear to be—for the complex black box of the customer satisfaction survey companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth the idea in brief many companies—striving for unprecedented growth by cultivating intensely loyal customers—invest lots of time and money measuring customer satisfaction but most of the yardsticks they use are complex yield ambiguous results and don’t necessarily correlate to profits or growth the good news is you don’t need expensive surveys and complex statistical models you only have to ask your customers one question “how likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague” the more “promoters” your company has the bigger its growth why is willingness to promote your company such a strong indicator of loyalty—and growth because when customers recommend you they’re putting their reputations on the line and they’ll take that risk only if they’re intensely loyal by asking this one question you collect simple and timely data that correlate with growth you also get responses you can easily interpret and communicate your message to employees—“get more promoters and fewer detractors”—becomes clearcut actionable and motivating especially when tied to incentives the idea in practice calculating your netpromoter score asking a statistically valid sample of customers “how likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague” enables you to calculate your netpromoter score the ratio of promoters to detractors based on their responses on a  to  rating scale group your customers into “promoters” – rating—extremely likely to recommend “passively satisfied” – rating and “detractors” – rating—extremely unlikely to recommend then subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters companies that garner worldclass loyalty receive netpromoter scores of  to more than  using your netpromoter score your netpromoter score provides valuable insights into how to get more promoters and fewer detractors for example compare your company’s scores region to region branch to branch sales rep to sales rep and customer segment to customer segment uncover root causes of differences and share best practices from your highestscoring groups also survey your competitors’ customers using the same method how does your company stack up against the very high bar of  to  netpromoter score motivating change use your score to send a clear message to managers and employees about the importance of promoters—and the dangers of detractors consider these guidelines be sure that everyone in the company knows which customers they’re responsible for then ensure that all business functions—not just market research—own and accept the survey process and results make your scores transparent throughout your organization present employees with numbers from a previous week or day showing the percentages and names of customers who are promoters passively satisfied and detractors then issue the managerial charge “we need more promoters and fewer detractors in order to grow” explain the dangers of detractors if your newcustomer flow can’t keep up with leaks in your customer bucket marketing costs will mount and cash flow decline create a sense of urgency by tying rewards to score improvement—giving customers in essence veto power over raises and promotions example  by making field managers ineligible for promotion unless their branch or group of branches matches or exceeds the company’s average netpromoter scores enterprise rentacar has seen its survey scores rise—and its growth increase relative to its rivals the ceos in the room knew all about the power of loyalty they had already transformed their companies into industry leaders largely by building intensely loyal relationships with customers and employees now the chief executives—from vanguard chickfila state farm and a halfdozen other leading companies—had gathered at a daylong forum to swap insights that would help them further enhance their loyalty efforts and what they were hearing from andy taylor the ceo of enterprise rentacar was riveting taylor and his senior team had figured out a way to measure and manage customer loyalty without the complexity of traditional customer surveys every month enterprise polled its customers using just two simple questions one about the quality of their rental experience and the other about the likelihood that they would rent from the company again because the process was so simple it was fast that allowed the company to publish ranked results for its  us branches within days giving the offices realtime feedback on how they were doing and the opportunity to learn from successful peers the survey was different in another important way in ranking the branches the company counted only the customers who gave the experience the highest possible rating that narrow focus on enthusiastic customers surprised the ceos in the room hands shot up what about the rest of enterprise’s customers the marginally satisfied who continued to rent from enterprise and were necessary to its business wouldn’t it be better to track in a more sophisticated way mean or median statistics no taylor said by concentrating solely on those most enthusiastic about their rental experience the company could focus on a key driver of profitable growth customers who not only return to rent again but also recommend enterprise to their friends enterprise’s approach surprised me too most customer satisfaction surveys aren’t very useful they tend to be long and complicated yielding low response rates and ambiguous implications that are difficult for operating managers to act on furthermore they are rarely challenged or audited because most senior executives board members and investors don’t take them very seriously that’s because their results don’t correlate tightly with profits or growth but enterprise’s method—and its ability to generate profitable growth through what appeared to be quite a simple tool—got me thinking that the company might be on to something could you get similar results in other industries—including those seemingly more complex than car rentals—by focusing only on customers who provided the most enthusiastic responses to a short list of questions designed to assess their loyalty to a company could the list be reduced to a single question if so what would that question be it took me two years of research to figure that out research that linked survey responses with actual customer behavior—purchasing patterns and referrals—and ultimately with company growth the results were clear yet counterintuitive it turned out that a single survey question can in fact serve as a useful predictor of growth but that question isn’t about customer satisfaction or even loyalty—at least in so many words rather it’s about customers’ willingness to recommend a product or service to someone else in fact in most of the industries that i studied the percentage of customers who were enthusiastic enough to refer a friend or colleague—perhaps the strongest sign of customer loyalty—correlated directly with differences in growth rates among competitors by substituting a single question for the complex black box of the typical customer satisfaction survey companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth certainly other factors besides customer loyalty play a role in driving a company’s growth—economic or industry expansion innovation and so on and i don’t want to overstate the findings although the “would recommend” question generally proved to be the most effective in determining loyalty and predicting growth that wasn’t the case in every single industry but evangelistic customer loyalty is clearly one of the most important drivers of growth while it doesn’t guarantee growth in general profitable growth can’t be achieved without it furthermore these findings point to an entirely new approach to customer surveys one based on simplicity that directly links to a company’s results by substituting a single question—blunt tool though it may appear to be—for the complex black box of the typical customer satisfaction survey companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth loyalty and growth before i describe my research and the results from a number of industries let’s briefly look at the concept of loyalty and some of the mistakes companies make when trying to measure it first a definition loyalty is the willingness of someone—a customer an employee a friend—to make an investment or personal sacrifice in order to strengthen a relationship for a customer that can mean sticking with a supplier who treats him well and gives him good value in the long term even if the supplier does not offer the best price in a particular transaction consequently customer loyalty is about much more than repeat purchases indeed even someone who buys again and again from the same company may not necessarily be loyal to that company but instead may be trapped by inertia indifference or exit barriers erected by the company or circumstance someone may regularly take the same airline to a city only because it offers the most flights there conversely a loyal customer may not make frequent repeat purchases because of a reduced need for a product or service someone may buy a new car less often as he gets older and drives less true loyalty clearly affects profitability while regular customers aren’t always profitable their choice to stick with a product or service typically reduces a company’s customer acquisition costs loyalty also drives topline growth obviously no company can grow if its customer bucket is leaky and loyalty helps eliminate this outflow indeed loyal customers can raise the water level in the bucket customers who are truly loyal tend to buy more over time as their incomes grow or they devote a larger share of their wallets to a company they feel good about and loyal customers talk up a company to their friends family and colleagues in fact such a recommendation is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer’s sacrifice if you will in making the recommendation when customers act as references they do more than indicate that they’ve received good economic value from a company they put their own reputations on the line and they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty note that here too loyalty may have little to do with repeat purchases as someone’s income increases she may move up the automotive ladder from the hondas she has bought for years but if she is loyal to the company she will enthusiastically recommend a honda to say a nephew who is buying his first car the tendency of loyal customers to bring in new customers—at no charge to the company—is particularly beneficial as a company grows especially if it operates in a mature industry in such a case the tremendous marketing costs of acquiring each new customer through advertising and other promotions make it hard to grow profitably in fact the only path to profitable growth may lie in a company’s ability to get its loyal customers to become in effect its marketing department the wrong yardsticks because loyalty is so important to profitable growth measuring and managing it make good sense unfortunately existing approaches haven’t proved very effective not only does their complexity make them practically useless to line managers but they also often yield flawed results the best companies have tended to focus on customer retention rates but that measurement is merely the best of a mediocre lot retention rates provide in many industries a valuable link to profitability but their relationship to growth is tenuous that’s because they basically track customer defections—the degree to which a bucket is emptying rather filling up furthermore as i have noted retention rates are a poor indication of customer loyalty in situations where customers are held hostage by high switching costs or other barriers or where customers naturally outgrow a product because of their aging increased income or other factors you’d want a stronger connection between retention and growth before you went ahead and invested significant money based only on data about retention an even less reliable means of gauging loyalty is through conventional customersatisfaction measures our research indicates that satisfaction lacks a consistently demonstrable connection to actual customer behavior and growth this finding is borne out by the short shrift that investors give to such reports as the american consumer satisfaction index the acsi published quarterly in the wall street journal reflects the customer satisfaction ratings of some  us companies in general it is difficult to discern a strong correlation between high customer satisfaction scores and outstanding sales growth indeed in some cases there is an inverse relationship at kmart for example a significant increase in the company’s acsi rating was accompanied by a sharp decrease in sales as it slid into bankruptcy even the most sophisticated satisfaction measurement systems have serious flaws i saw this firsthand at one of the big three car manufacturers the marketing executive at the company wanted to understand why after the firm had spent millions of dollars on customer satisfaction surveys satisfaction ratings for individual dealers did not relate very closely to dealer profits or growth when i interviewed dealers they agreed that customer satisfaction seemed like a reasonable goal but they also pointed out that other factors were far more important to their profits and growth such as keeping pressure on salespeople to close a high percentage of leads filling showrooms with prospects through aggressive advertising and charging customers the highest possible price for a car in most cases dealers told me the satisfaction survey is a charade that they play along with to remain in the good graces of the manufacturer and to ensure generous allocations of the hottestselling models the pressure they put on salespeople to boost scores often results in postsale pleading with customers to provide top ratings—even if they must offer something like free floor mats or oil changes in return dealers are usually complicit with salespeople in this process a circumstance that further degrades the integrity of these scores indeed some savvy customers negotiate a low price—and then offer to sell the dealer a set of top satisfaction survey ratings for another  off the price figuring out a way to accurately measure customer loyalty and satisfaction is extremely important companies won’t realize the fruits of loyalty until usable measurement systems enable firms to measure their performance against clear loyalty goals—just as they now do in the case of profitability and quality goals for a while it seemed as though information technology would provide a means to accurately measure loyalty sophisticated customerrelationshipmanagement systems promised to help firms track customer behavior in real time but the successes thus far have been limited to select industries such as credit cards or grocery stores where purchases are so frequent that changes in customer loyalty can be quickly spotted and acted on getting the facts so what would be a useful metric for gauging customer loyalty to find out i needed to do something rarely undertaken with customer surveys match survey responses from individual customers to their actual behavior—repeat purchases and referral patterns—over time i sought the assistance of satmetrix a company that develops software to gather and analyze realtime customer feedback—and on whose board of directors i serve teams from bain also helped with the project we started with the roughly  questions on the loyalty acid test a survey that i designed four years ago with bain colleagues which does a pretty good job of establishing the state of relations between a company and its customers the complete test can be found at httpwww loyaltyrulescomloyaltyrulesacidtestcustomerhtml we administered the test to thousands of customers recruited from public lists in six industries financial services cable and telephony personal computers ecommerce auto insurance and internet service providers we then obtained a purchase history for each person surveyed and asked those people to name specific instances in which they had referred someone else to the company in question when this information wasn’t immediately available we waited six to  months and gathered information on subsequent purchases and referrals from those individuals with information from more than  customers we were able to build  case studies—that is cases in which we had sufficient sample sizes to measure the link between survey responses of individual customers of a company and those individuals’ actual referral and purchase behavior the data allowed us to determine which survey questions had the strongest statistical correlation with repeat purchases or referrals we hoped that we would find at least one question for each industry that effectively predicted such behaviors which can drive growth we found something more one question was best for most industries “how likely is it that you would recommend company x to a friend or colleague” ranked first or second in  of the  cases studies and in two of the three other cases “would recommend” ranked so close behind the top two predictors that the surveys would be nearly as accurate by relying on results of this single question for a ranking of the bestscoring questions see the sidebar “ask the right question” ask the right question as part of our research into customer loyalty and growth my colleagues and i looked for a correlation between survey responses and actual behavior—repeat purchases or recommendations to friends and peers—that would ultimately lead to profitable growth based on information from  consumers we ranked a variety of survey questions according to their ability to predict this desirable behavior interestingly creating a weighted index—based on the responses to multiple questions and taking into account the relative effectiveness of those questions—provided insignificant predictive advantage the topranking question was far and away the most effective across industries how likely is it that you would recommend company x to a friend or colleague two questions were effective predictors in certain industries how strongly do you agree that company x deserves your loyalty how likely is it that you will continue to purchase productsservices from company x other questions while useful in a particular industry had little general applicability how strongly do you agree that company x sets the standard for excellence in its industry how strongly do you agree that company x makes it easy for you to do business with it if you were selecting a similar provider for the first time how likely is it that you would you choose company x how strongly do you agree that company x creates innovative solutions that make your life easier how satisfied are you with company x’s overall performance these findings surprised me my personal bet for the top question probably reflecting the focus of my research on employee loyalty in recent years would have been “how strongly do you agree that company x deserves your loyalty” clearly though the abstract concept of loyalty was less compelling to customers than what may be the ultimate act of loyalty a recommendation to a friend i also expected that “how strongly do you agree that company x sets the standard for excellence in its industry”—with its implications of offering customers both economic benefit and fair treatment—would prove more predictive than it did one result did not startle me at all the question “how satisfied are you with company x’s overall performance” while relevant in certain industries would prove to be a relatively weak predictor of growth so my colleagues and i had the right question—“how likely is it that you would recommend company x to a friend or colleague”—and now we needed to develop a scale to score the responses this may seem somewhat trivial but as statisticians know it’s not making customer loyalty a strategic goal that managers can work toward requires a scale as simple and unambiguous as the question itself the right one will effectively divide customers into practical groups deserving different attention and organizational responses it must be intuitive to customers when they assign grades and to employees and partners responsible for interpreting the results and taking action ideally the scale would be so easy to understand that even outsiders such as investors regulators and journalists would grasp the basic messages without needing a handbook and a statistical abstract for these reasons we settled on a scale where ten means “extremely likely” to recommend five means neutral and zero means “not at all likely” when we examined customer referral and repurchase behaviors along this scale we found three logical clusters “promoters” the customers with the highest rates of repurchase and referral gave ratings of nine or ten to the question the “passively satisfied” logged a seven or an eight and “detractors” scored from zero to six by limiting the promoter designation to only the most enthusiastic customers we avoided the “grade inflation” that often infects traditional customersatisfaction assessments in which someone a molecule north of neutral is considered “satisfied” this was the danger that enterprise rentacar avoided when it decided to focus on its most enthusiastic customers and not only did clustering customers into three categories—promoters the passively satisfied and detractors—turn out to provide the simplest most intuitive and best predictor of customer behavior it also made sense to frontline managers who could relate to the goal of increasing the number of promoters and reducing the number of detractors more readily than increasing the mean of their satisfaction index by one standard deviation the growth connection all of our analysis to this point had focused on customer survey responses and how well those linked to customers’ referral and repurchase behavior at  companies in six industries but the real test would be how well this approach explained relative growth rates for all competitors in an industry—and across a broader range of industry sectors the only path to profitable growth may lie in a company’s ability to get its loyal customers to become in effect its marketing department in the first quarter of  satmetrix began tracking the “would recommend” scores of a new universe of customers many thousands of them from more than  companies in more than a dozen industries in each subsequent quarter they then gathered  to  responses to a very brief email survey that asked respondents drawn again from public sources not satmetrix’s internal client customer lists to rate one or two companies with which they were familiar where we could obtain comparable and reliable revenuegrowth data for a range of competitors and where there were sufficient consumer responses we plotted each firm’s net promoters—the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors—against the company’s revenue growth rate the results were striking in airlines for example a strong correlation existed between netpromoter figures and a company’s average growth rate over the threeyear period from  to  remarkably this one simple statistic seemed to explain the relative growth rates across the entire industry that is no airline has found a way to increase growth without improving its ratio of promoters to detractors that result was reflected to a greater or lesser degree in most of the industries we examined—including rental cars where enterprise enjoys both the highest rate of growth and the highest netpromoter percentage among its competitors see the exhibit “growth by word of mouth” the “would recommend” question wasn’t the best predictor of growth in every case in a few situations it was simply irrelevant in database software or computer systems for instance senior executives select vendors and top managers typically didn’t appear on the public email lists we used to sample customers asking users of the system whether they would recommend the system to a friend or colleague seemed a little abstract as they had no choice in the matter in these cases we found that the “sets the standard of excellence” or “deserves your loyalty” questions were more predictive not surprisingly “would recommend” also didn’t predict relative growth in industries dominated by monopolies and near monopolies where consumers have little choice for example in the local telephone and cable tv businesses population growth and economic expansion in the region determine growth rates not how well customers are treated by their suppliers and in certain cases we found small niche companies that were growing faster than their netpromoter percentages would imply but for most companies in most industries getting customers enthusiastic enough to recommend a company appears to be crucial to growth to calculate your own netpromoter number see the sidebar “a netpromoter primer” a netpromoter primer tracking net promoters—the percentage of customers who are promoters of a brand or company minus the percentage who are detractors—offers organizations a powerful way to measure and manage customer loyalty firms with the highest netpromoter scores consistently garner the lion’s share of industry growth so how can companies get started survey a statistically valid sample of your customers with the following question “how likely is it that you would recommend brand or company x to a friend or colleague” it’s critical to provide a consistent scale for responses that range from zero to ten where zero means not at all likely five means neutral and ten means extremely likely resist the urge to let survey questions multiply more questions diminish response rates along with the reliability of your sample you need only one question to determine the status—promoter passively satisfied or detractor—of a customer followup questions can help unearth the reasons for customers’ feelings and point to profitable remedies but such questions should be tailored to the three categories of customers learning how to turn a passively satisfied customer into a promoter requires a very different line of questioning from learning how to resolve the problems of a detractor calculate the percentage of customers who respond with nine or ten promoters and the percentage who respond with zero through six detractors subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters to arrive at your netpromoter score don’t be surprised if your score is lower than you expect the median netpromoter score of more than  companies in  industries based on some  customer survey responses gathered over the past twoplus years by satmetrix a maker of software for managing realtime customer feedback was just  compare netpromoter scores from specific regions branches service or sales reps and customer segments this often reveals root causes of differences as well as best practices that can be shared what really counts of course is how your company compares with direct competitors have your market researchers survey your competitors’ customers using the same method you can then determine how your company stacks up within your industry and whether your current netpromoter number is a competitive asset or a liability improve your score the companies with the most enthusiastic customer referrals including ebay amazon and usaa receive netpromoter scores of  to more than  for companies aiming to garner worldclass loyalty—and the growth that comes with it—this should be the target the dangers of detractors the battle for growth among internet service providers aol msn and earthlink brings to life our findings for years market leader aol aggressively focused on new customer acquisition through those efforts aol more than offset a substantial number of defections but the company paid much less attention to converting these new customers into intensely loyal promoters customer service lapsed to the point where customers couldn’t even find a phone number to contact company representatives to answer questions or resolve problems today aol is struggling to grow even though aol’s customer count surged to an eventual peak of  million its deteriorating mix of promoters and detractors eventually choked off expansion the fire hose of new customer flow—filled with people attracted to free trial promotions—couldn’t keep up with the leaks in aol’s customer bucket defection rates exceeded  customers per month in  marketing costs were ratcheted up to stem the tide and those expenditures along with the collapse of online advertising contributed to declines in cash flow of almost  between  and  by  our research found  of the company’s customers were detractors while only  were promoters giving the company a netpromoter percentage of  the current management team is working on the problem but it’s a challenging one because disappointed customers are undoubtedly spreading their opinions about aol to family friends colleagues and acquaintances aol’s dialup competitors have done a better job in building promoters and it shows in their relative rates of growth msn invested  million in rd to upgrade its service with functional improvements such as improved parental controls and spam filters by  msn’s promoter population reached  of its customer base compared with a detractor population of  giving the company a netpromoter percentage of  earthlink managed to nearly match msn’s netpromoter score over this period by continuing to invest in the reliability of its dialup connections minimizing the irritation of busy signals and dropped connections and by making phone support readily available aol’s experience vividly illustrates the folly of seeking growth through shortcuts such as massive price cuts or other incentives rather than through building true loyalty it also illustrates the detrimental effect that detractors’ wordofmouth communications can have on a business—the flip side of customers’ recommendations to their friends countering a damaged reputation requires a company to create tremendously appealing incentives that will persuade skeptical customers to give a product or service a try and the incentives drive up already significant customer acquisition costs furthermore detractors—and even customers who are only passively satisfied but not enthusiastically loyal—typically take a toll on employees and increase service costs finally every detractor represents a missed opportunity to add a promoter to the customer population one more unpaid salesperson to market your product or service and generate growth keep it simple one of the main takeaways from our research is that companies can keep customer surveys simple the most basic surveys—employing the right questions—can allow companies to report timely data that are easy to act on too many of today’s satisfaction survey processes yield complex information that’s months out of date by the time it reaches frontline managers good luck to the branch manager who tries to help an employee interpret a score resulting from a complex weighting algorithm based on feedback from anonymous customers many of whom were surveyed before the employee had his current job contrast that scenario with one in which a manager presents employees with numbers from the previous week or day showing the percentages and names of a branch office’s customers who are promoters passively satisfied and detractors—and then issues the managerial charge “we need more promoters and fewer detractors in order to grow” the goal is clearcut actionable and motivating in short a customer feedback program should be viewed not as “market research” but as an operating management tool again consider enterprise rentacar the first step in the development of enterprise’s current system was to devise a way to track loyalty by measuring service quality from the customer’s perspective the initial effort yielded a long unwieldy research questionnaire one that included the pet questions of everyone involved in drafting the survey it only captured average service quality on a regional basis—interesting but useless since managers needed to see scores for each individual branch to establish clear accountability over time the sample was expanded to provide this information and the number of questions on the survey was sharply reduced this simplified the collating of answers and allowed the company to post monthly branchlevel results almost as soon as they were collected the company then began examining the relationships between customer responses and actual purchases and referrals this is when enterprise learned the value of enthusiasts customers who gave the highest rating to their rental experience were three times more likely to rent again than those who gave enterprise the secondhighest grade when a customer reported a neutral or negative experience marking him a potential detractor the interviewer requested permission to immediately forward this information to the branch manager who was trained how to apologize identify the root cause of the problem and resolve it the measurement system cost more than  million per year but the company made such significant progress in building customer loyalty that the company’s management considers it one of the company’s best investments and the new system had definitely started to get employees’ attention in fact a few branch managers perhaps taking a cue from car dealers attempted to manipulate the system to their benefit enterprise responded with a process for spotting—for example by ensuring that the phone numbers of dissatisfied respondents hadn’t been changed making it difficult to follow up—and punishing “gamers” despite the system’s success ceo andy taylor felt something was missing branch scores were not improving quickly enough and a big gap continued to separate the worst and bestperforming regions taylor’s assessment “we needed a greater sense of urgency” so the management team decided that field managers would not be eligible for promotion unless their branch or group of branches matched or exceeded the company’s average scores that’s a pretty radical idea when you think about it giving customers in effect veto power over managerial pay raises and promotions the rigorous implementation of this simple customer feedback system had a clear impact on business as the survey scores rose so did enterprise’s growth relative to its competition taylor cites the linking of customer feedback to employee rewards as one of the most important reasons that enterprise has continued to grow even as the business became bigger and arguably more mature for more on enterprise’s customer survey program see “driving customer satisfaction” hbr july  converting customers into promoters if collecting and applying customer feedback is this simple why don’t companies already do it this way i don’t want to be too cynical but perhaps the research firms that administer current customer surveys know there is very little profit margin for them in something as barebones as this complex loyalty indexes based on a dozen or more proprietary questions and weighted with a blackbox scaling function simply generate more business for survey firms this article also appears in hbr’s  must reads on strategic marketing sales and marketing book  add to cart save share the market research firms have an even deeper fear with the advent of email and analytical software leadingedge companies can now bypass the research firms entirely cutting costs and improving the quality and timeliness of feedback these new tools enable companies to gather customer feedback and report results in real time funneling it directly to frontline employees and managers this can also threaten inhouse market research departments which typically have built their power base through controlling and interpreting customer survey data marketing departments understandably focus surveys on the areas they can control such as brand image pricing and product features but a customer’s willingness to recommend to a friend results from how well the customer is treated by frontline employees which in turn is determined by all the functional areas that contribute to a customer’s experience for a measure to be practical operational and reliable—that is for it to determine the percentage of net promoters among customers and allow managers to act on it—the process and the results need to be owned and accepted by all of the business functions and all the people in the organization must know which customers they are responsible for overseeing such a process is a more appropriate task for the cfo or for the general manager of the business unit than for the marketing department indeed it is too important and politically charged to delegate to any one function the path to sustainable profitable growth begins with creating more promoters and fewer detractors and making your netpromoter number transparent throughout your organization this number is the one number you need to grow it’s that simple and that profound a version
