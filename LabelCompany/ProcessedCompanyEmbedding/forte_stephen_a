fractures due to his oi brittle bones this last time a friend introduced us to forte fracture recovery we found blending one package with a banana and about a cup of milk was the best “recipe” the orthopedist was very happy with the progress between surgery and the three week followup it’s hard to say the impact of this product but we are very excited that work is being done that could potentially prevent reduce or help heal fractures especially for someone more prone to broken bones may   elaine  out of  forté fracture i have been taking the forté fracture product for three months i was having difficulty getting my femur fracture that occurred a year and a half ago to heal after an unsuccessful bone graft my physician recommended i take forté fracture i started taking it three months ago since taking forté fracture my xrays have shown mending and continued healing the chocolate flavor tastes fine even though my stomach has a hard time handling chocolate so i mix the product

a vp of sales my personal experience and more recently working with fresco capital’s startups has taught me that no matter how different each business and startup process might be nearly all new cofounders and ceos eventually pose the same important inevitable question when do i hire a vp of sales my response is always the same when you really need one so what does that mean cofounder and ceo talent and time management most cofounders and early ceos prefer to focus their talent and energy on conceiving and building the new enterprise the most successful ceos come from backgrounds in finance and operationsonly  of fortune  ceos started out in sales or marketing yet many company leaders also necessarily take on the crucial task of generating those early sales while a ceo may excel at creating connections and relationships few are sales experts and are typically overwhelmed with the task’s time commitment so during startup and initial operations when ceos think in terms of building the company by building a stellar leadership team they want to pass on those vital sales responsibilities as quickly as possible to a proven sales expert after all a good leader should hire other good leaders right not yet this is not the time to buy the rolex although a new ceo and leadership team typically want to hire a proven vp of sales from a very successful company making a rolex hire early in the company development  and paying rolex prices for the talent  is not the answer in fact poaching an expert vp of sales by offering a sizeable opportunity and compensation package is counterproductive heres why an extremely successful vp of sales has become successful because they effectively manage a sales force a new vp will want to replicate that success by building their new sales team and developing a sales process complete with expensive sales automation tools in the long term that is exactly what your company needs in the short term however that is a potentially dangerous waste of resources for your new company during a crucial period yes i am saying that google sheets is a perfectly good crm at this stage while the vp of sales is putting together a team and developing longterm strategies nobody is focusing on making actual sales  lots of money going out none coming in the results can be disastrous the vp of sales and the team are either fired quit or the company runs out of money  build your sales team from the bottom up there is a much better option build your sales team from the bottom up it may feel counterintuitive but the bottom up process is more logical and practical for new companies it makes much more sense tohire a junior salesperson  someone who will one day report to the vp you eventually hire the junior salesperson is expected to be out there making contacts and making sales which is  at this point in time  what the company needslook for someone in the industry with knowledge and experience demonstrated success and capacity to learn i know that the ceo is eager to offload the sales process but recognize you will need to spend time mentoring your new hire and plan to give them at only  of the labor the first month or two dont expect them to do all your sales work  understand that the ceo may still want  or need   to close these early important deals and the new hire will only shadow the ceo for the first few weeks growing into the role the point is that a cofounder or ceo should be doing primarily what the ceo alone can do  especially in sales  after the salesperson starts to take over more and more responsibility and sales start increasing hire another junior salesperson and start slowly building your team most importantly keep the team focused on generating sales at this point allow the team to start building a sales process and choose some tools that fit your environment now you need a vp of sales so when do you hire the vp of sales the answer is simple hire your vp of sales when youre generating enough sales for a vp to manage and your process is starting to strain at scale thats when you really need one thats when it makes sense tohire a megatalented vp of sales with exactly the qualities and skills you need thats when youre ready to recruit a proven effective leader someone qualified to create the big vision continue building a sales force make the strategic longrange plan and facilitate the teams success and thats when you can afford to invest in the best vp of sales you can find in the meanwhile the bottom up strategy is a better shortterm approach in terms of all primary company resources  money staff time and it leads directly to stronger company success in the long term accelerator  startups  techie  web  posted on wednesday  august   eastern daylight time utc      comments  trackback  wednesday  july  the gig economy’s impact on the future of work i was recently in an uber on the way to the airport when i started chatting my driver up it turned out he had three similar ondemand kind of jobs—none of which were stable traditional gigs this got me thinking many of today’s workers and the younger ones in particular are more entrepreneurial than their predecessors—despite the fact that they aren’t necessarily bona fide entrepreneurs more than  years ago i landed my first real job a fulltime entrylevel position on wall street at fidelity investments remember young professionals used to be able to get entrylevel jobs at good companies and climb the ladder but today those jobs simply don’t exist as many lower positions are outsourced or automated with technology the economy has changed and new hires are expected to come to the job and start producing on day  hard to do with only a university degree altogether these trends have led to a generational bulge of middletier jobs this area of the workforce is now occupied by people who usually would have moved out of those jobs faster allowing the younger generation to advance sooner but now they cant get move upward at all since folks in the middle tier stay there forever it seems as a result more and more people are leaving the lower rungs of traditional employment and are deciding to take part of the gig economy that way they’ll get the requisite experience to hit the ground running on day  should they be offered a regular job by an established company how young workers get ahead in the gig economy want to land a job at pixar you’ll probably have to freelance for a while think youtube design videos should you perform well in that role you might get picked up fulltime within the next  years many project as much as  of the us workforce will be made up of freelancers this is both a blessing and a curse of the gig economy—especially as it pertains to younger people just entering the workforce in the past even those without a career path would fall into a nice profession simply by following the standard track but todayyou need to be more hustleoriented and driven to reach just the first rung of many corporate ladders to be fair there are exceptions to the rule the career paths for lawyers and doctors might be the same due to the advanced education and certification required for those professions—and the free market probably won’t and shouldn’t change that nobody really wants a doctor who’s pieced together experience by performing operations on a gigbasis right the disruption of venture capital while the rise of the gig economy has shaken up traditional career paths it’s also enabled younger workers to make inroads into previously exclusive industries—like venture capital it used to be that to get into vc you needed an introduction from a family member or friend to land an internship after that you’d become an analyst do well there and you’d earn your vc stripes then leave and go to a fancy business school and go to a new vc fund as an associate the better the mba the better associate job you’d get and so on that’s not true any longer nowadays there are several hundred vc firms and hiring managers there are looking for entrepreneurs or former founders with operating experience for example at my fund fresco capital we have three partners and three associates and i am the only one with an mba and that was by accident  what the gig economy means for young workers but remember thanks in large part to the gig economy there are other ways to meet that entrepreneurial criterion or grab that operating experience that don’t involve bschool just take a look at elon musk’s story when he started out the serial entrepreneur had his sights set on working at google he waited outside the company’s mountain view campus hoping to talk to people and was eventually rejected of course we know how musk’s story has turned out he’s started a bunch of bigtime businesses which just goes to show that there are very nontraditional ways to cut your teeth nowadays at firstthe gig economy looks scary there’s no traditional goto school to attend to land your dream job but the gig economy does provide a democratization of talent—work is there so long as you’re willing to hustle graduating seniors should consider the gig economy as a viable means for getting those tougher jobs the first step to landing your dream job starts with understanding that the economy is changing the second step realizing you need to work harder and harder to beat out the next person what the gig economy means for employers if large companies decide to hire kids right out of college simply because of where they went they’re going to miss out on the best and brightest workers—it’s as simple as that more and more young workers are getting their first experience in the freelance economy if you’re afraid to tap into this pool of talent it’s only a matter of time before your company will lose all of its competitive advantage we’re going through a transitional period in the economy and the traditional means of getting a job doesn’t apply anymore the sooner both young professionals and their prospective employers understand this the better off all parties will be   accelerator  startups  web  posted on wednesday  july   eastern daylight time utc      comments  trackback  tuesday  july  should you target supply or demand in a twosided market a lot of startups—even ones with enormous valuations—are really just twosided marketplaces ebay connects buyers and sellers uber connects drivers with those who need rides airbnb connects homeowners with travelers who need a place to stay youtube connects content creators with those looking to be entertained dating sites—like okcupid—connect daters with dates the list goes on and on in each of these twosided marketplaces there is supply and demand there are a finite amount of people selling memorabilia on ebay a finite amount of drivers on uber a finite amount of hosts on airbnb a finite amount of quality videos on youtube and a finite amount of “dateworthy” individuals on dating sites when companies are just starting out there comes a time in every founder’s life when he or she has to ask themselves whether their startup is going to focus primarily on enhancing the supply side of the equation or nurturing the demand side when i mentor earlystage companies just getting started out it’s a question i get seemingly every day so which is it why you need to focus on supply there’s only one clear answer to the question follow the pattern of the most successful startups and focus like a laser on supply why switching costs or the costs incurred—money energy and time—when a supplier or consumer switches platforms there are a lot of barriers standing in the way between a seller on ebay and the potential buyer for example the seller needs to create an account then he or she needs to take pictures of whatever’s for sale next it’s time to create a listing finally the seller needs to cross his or her fingers and hope that a buyer is interested in conducting a transaction with someone who hasn’t been reviewed by peers over time if the seller conducts successful transactions his or her rating will go up all of this of course doesn’t happen overnight but once a seller commits to establishing a presence on ebay it’s unlikely he or she will abandon the platform and set up shop elsewhere the switching costs are too high why you shouldn’t focus on demand thanks to technology the switching costs associated with customers not finding what they want are negligible imagine a customer goes to ebay and finds only one seller offering the item he or she is looking for unfortunately the item appears to be extremely overpriced to solve the problem the customer simply needs to click on the search bar of his or her browser and navigate over to amazon should that fail the person might head tojet or conduct a simple google search they might seek out even other alternatives the associated switching costs are infinitesimal all shoppers need is a few seconds examples of startups targeting supply need a little more convincing on the virtues of focusing on the supply side of your platform consider these three cases airbnb works super hard to get its hosts online it providesfree professional photographers to help make listings beautiful the company also provideshelpful advice eg provide soap that hosts can leverage to increase the chances their guests have enjoyable stays this handholding helps bring hosts into the airbnb family which is a good thing considering how boring the site would be if it only had three hosts ie three suppliers in each city youtube helps content providers produce better videos the site offers a ton of free tools including digital studios editing support and analytics it also offers revenue sharing altogether these perks translate into the reality that there are practicallycountless users uploading infinite hours of footage to the site not only can you make better videos you can make money ashley madison the online dating site that encourages infidelity infamously went as far as creating fake supply to encourage users to engage with the platform—something that was uncovered when the company’s private data was posted online according to its own statistics ashley madison had  million male users and  million female users turns outup to  of those female users weren’t real but the site’s owners had to figure out how to keep the male users coming back if you build it they customers will come—assuming there’s enough supply of whatever it happens to be by focusing on the supply side of the equation it becomes that much easier for your startup to reach the next level accelerator  nontechie  web  posted on tuesday  july   eastern daylight time utc      comments  trackback  friday  july  what we learned from hosting a bots hackathon in india last weekend in pune india fresco capital along with our longtime partner ezest produced a  hour hackathon about building bots a few weeks ago i explained why a venture capitalist is running a developer hackathon in india our main goal was to learn about bots by seeing what developers are currently doing with bots and using that to look into the future of bots                      the current state of bots at the hackathon we had over  developers pounding away at the facebook microsoft slack and other bot frameworks after looking at over  bot applications we learned a lot the most common thing that stood out was that most of the users interacted with the bots in some form of chat client facebook was by far the most popular interface for the bots however we saw a lot of slack microsoft skype and even a few using hipchat one team wrote their own chat interface to interact with the bot   the second common thread was that for these chat interfaces most apps integrated some form of natural language processing nlp into their interface very common but not nearly as ubiquitous as npl was a voice interface  we also started to detect some common categories of bot applications while not all of the  bot applications we saw fall perfectly into these three categories the most common categories are  api bridge the ability to interact with a rd party application interacting with hardware  tools api bridges by far the most common bot category we saw integration with many rd party tools for example hotel booking with trident hotels api in slack skype integration with an internal timesheet application pipedrive integration with slack glassdoor integrated with facebook messenger  one very creative bot consumed the api of the host and gave you many useful statistics about the conversation thread you are in these are the most common bot application as rd party integration is the logical use of bots based on the current technology and user comfort level with bots today interaction with hardware we saw a few bots including the overall winner interact with hardware such as the raspberry pi still interfacing via a char client but controlling external hardware this is part of the future of bots allowing a bot to interact with your tv music player and car tools while you can build bots with traditional software development tools we saw a few tool oriented bot applications one of the finalists was called magic bot” and they would build your bot for you if you gave the tool your api and a list of commands we also saw some home grown interaction clients that would also learn you behaviors clearly these developers view a future where everyone will be rushing to release a bot similar to a time where everyone wanted a web site or mobile app  startup and developer ecosystem our interaction with the indian ecosystem was very fruitful i got to meet over  startups at the startup pitch event that was colocated at the hackathon big trends were team collaboration tools not surprising in a market known for remote development health care and consumer based apps startups seem to have access to early stage capital but mid to later stage capital is hard to find indian startups can be categorized into something that is either hyper local or something that is very global from the onset i was not expecting to see such a mature ecosystem and was blow away we learned a lot at the hackathon and it was a positive experiment look for our next experiment somewhere around the world

valley planners from all over the world try to replicate the success of silicon valley with varying levels of success everyone from new york city silicon alley to london silicon roundabout to hong kong silicon harbour to moscow skolkovo has mimicked silicon valley in an attempt to build their own version of the lucrative startup hub the problem is that silicon valley has unique features that have allowed the region to become the world’s center of gravity for innovation simply copying the things that allowed silicon valley to become such a success won’t work as some regions have already discovered the tech hubs need to play to their strengths and evolve in their own unique ways silicon valley’s recipe for success it’s easy to see why governments want to create their own version of silicon valley when looking at the valuations the california region is blessed with there are now at least  startups there valued at more  billion each the total value of these socalled “unicorns” is  billion the reasons for silicon valley’s success are many and most of them can’t be easily copied geographically the region is perfectly located near san jose san francisco and oakland historically silicon valley has experienced decades of success with wellestablished companies like google facebook apple fairchild semiconductors intel tesla and other esteemed companies in silicon valley everyone knows somebody who has gotten rich off of stock options they think they’re smarter thanwhich in turn propels them to take a risk at a startup perhaps most important for the region’s growth is this competitive and creative culture that continues to allow so many companies to thrive not to mention an endless supply of elite students from stanford and berkeley graduate and dropout each year to create the next crop of potential tech giants right in the valley but this formula can’t be bottled upon and shoehorned in anywhere the wealthy people in san francisco might work at google and the likes yet in hong kong and new york the upper class tend to come from finance and in los angeles it’s hollywood—hopefully you get the idea this still doesn’t stop governments and business people from trying to replicate silicon valley without taking culture and demographics into account being unique playing to your region’s strengths every wouldbe tech hub has its own unique characteristics and features that need to be taken advantage of if you go to a starbucks in los angeles you’re likely to bump into a celebrity or similar entertainment personas for hong kong or new york city odds are high that you’ll fall into a conversation around recent market performance and sec developments playing to a specific region’s strengths helps lead to success modeling a hub exactly from silicon valley in areas that don’t carry the same characteristics becomes a major disadvantage new york hong kong and london are better suited to be fintech startup hub than silicon valley los angeles is better suited to be an entertainment startup hub than silicon valley playing to those unique strengths make more sense than trying to replicate silicon valley fostering growth government benefits are a welcome way to help foster startups yet they’re only the baseline and not the endgame all those helpful benefits friendly tax policies real estate deals subsidies incubators etc only go so far the barriers of entry to create a tech innovation center in the vein of silicon valley are so high that these benefits are simply the table stakes a bigger greater hook is needed for regions to succeed regions need to embrace what makes them unique and build off of that with everyone trying to copy silicon valley there’s plenty of room for new players with their own strengths any place that simply tries to do exactly what silicon valley is doing will pale in comparison to the original accelerator  startups  web  posted on wednesday  may   eastern daylight time utc      comments  trackback  thursday  april  using the virality coefficient to drive business decisions you need more than hope and good intentions if your startup relies on viral growth you need data and metrics to drive decision making going viral isn’t an exact science but data plays an important role in gauging how successful your customer acquisition efforts will be focus on the virality coefficient before all other metrics it shows the impact of each product choice on growth the formula developed by david skok illustrates how each new feature impacts your customer base   viralitydependent businesses need to craft their strategy and every decision they make around the virality coefficient to be successful otherwise you’ll sound like these businesses not finding growth   a number of companies have pitched me by saying they will “go viral” and attract users when it’s obvious that they have no believable plans to make it a reality many don’t even have share buttons on their apps one company made it so difficult to share their app with others that i never used it again that’s a virality coefficient of  clearly their focus wandered let me explain what that means   the virality coefficient explained   there are four variables used to determine the virality coefficient   initial customers custs number of invites sent out i the conversation rate of customers conv the number of days it takes to complete a full viral cycle ct combine these factors to calculate it using this spreadsheet   virality in action   let’s say you have ten users and send them ten invites each  total invites with a  conversion rate you’ll finish with a total of  customers after the first campaign using the sheet i linked to previously that gives you a virality coefficient of two invites  the conversion rate or rather      for the next campaign send out  invites to the  new users  total invites assuming there’s no churn or change in the virality coefficient a  conversion rate will bring in  new users for a total of  users look at the below chart to see just how much of impact each campaign can have due to its compounding effects even small changes in your virality coefficient will have massive impacts on your business   cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  cycle  starting customers           invites sent           conversions to new customers           total customers           there needs to be a coefficient of at least one for there to be growth anything less means you’re churning customers   crafting a plan   to determine which feature to develop in your product backlog sort the features based on the predicted increase in the virality coefficient the backlog should look something like this chart   feature increase of virality share button  social login  cool feature  photo sharing  logout  you need a virality business plan to map out exactly how you’re going to acquire new customers the plan should determine what features to prioritize what incentives there are for users to share and what level of engagement you want to focus on don’t forget to determine which promotion channels to use too determining what makes user acquisition work might seem like an art but using the virality coefficient can change that use your data to drive the decisionmaking process even a small increase could mean hundreds of thousands of new customers over time agile  startups  web  posted on thursday  april   eastern daylight time utc      comments  trackback  tuesday  march  don’t waste your time on startup tourism going on a trip to silicon valley with your mba program or government incubator don’t fool yourself into thinking that those weeklong silicon valley immersion programs are anything other than startup tourism spending a week visiting facebook and uber and attending talks and events while interesting and potentially educational will not teach you what its like to build a startup sure you might make some connections and come closer to figuring out what you really want to do for a living but if you really want to benefit from a trip to silicon valley you are better off reaching out to one of the several earlystage startups here and asking whether you can intern for a few weeks you’ll understand how startups work while immersion programs are designed to introduce you to the world of startups they don’t go far enough when it comes to actually shining a light on the intricacies of silicon valley sure you can see the free food at twitter swimming pool at google and the hiking trail at facebook but that is like visiting disneyland and thinking it is reality by reaching out to a startup instead and interning there you will develop real relationships and potentially kickstart a career you will understand how startups work behind the scenes and you’ll be influenced by their way of doing business actual work experience is going to look a lot better on your résumé than spending a week hardly scratching the surface of the startup world think of it like studying abroad there are two ways to go about it one is to study at a university where the classes are taught in english you have no homework and you can hop around to a bunch of different countries every weekend you get a broad overview of another culture but no lasting and profound understanding of it on the other hand you could spend a year in another country live with a host family and learn the language you’ll struggle and it will be challenging but in the end you’ll have an indepth understanding of that culture and how it differs from yours at the end you’ll belong to two cultures rather than just one it’s up to you but i’d take the latter experience over the former any day you’ll gain unique insights when you attend a weeklong immersion program you’ll get a light taste of what you could expect should you move to silicon valley at some point in the future but by interning with a company out there—and living and working in the environment itself—you’ll gain unique insights that you can’t get anywhere else you need to experience them on your own organically how to find startups to work for you might be wondering how you can actually get hired maybe you don’t have startup experience yet maybe you’re a developer who wants to work for google but you’ve only been coding for a year and you just don’t have the necessary expertise head on over toangellist the best place to learn about which companies are hiring out in silicon valley angellist connects startups with jobseekers interested in working for them the site provides you a clear view as to what you can expect should you land a gig eg salary and equity is disclosed up front the best part by sending out one application you can apply to over  jobs in one fell swoop talk about efficiency how to get a startup to hire you don’t think any startups will take you don’t be so hard on yourself pitch attractive wouldbe employers a short project that utilizes your skills for example if you’re a communications major offer to come in for two weeks to consult and intern with them for free in exchange for a reference most startups don’t have any communications or pr plan and are happy to take free labor are you a political science major offer to come and do an analysis on the effects new policy or the upcoming elections will have on them think no startups care about this just ask uber what they think if you don’t have any “practical” skills whatsoever offer to clean the coffee machines and work your way up maximize your trip to silicon valley those weeklong programs aren’t the worst thing in the world i’ve even hosted them before at my office in palo alto but the payoff is much higher if you actually immerse yourself in the experience for an extended amount of time remember if you’re part of one of these programs your trip doesn’t have to end once a week is up stay a little bit longer you won’t regret it   accelerator  startups  web  posted on tuesday  march   eastern standard time utc      comments  trackback  wednesday  march  hiring the ideal startup team in the early days of your startup you might have heard you should have a hacker a hustler and a hipster on the founding team that makes a lot of sense in the initial stages of your company due to the experimental nature of the business remember what steve blank says a startup is not a “real” business but rather “an experiment searching for a business model” once you start to move out of the coffee shop and build your initial team you’ll have to make some careful hiring decisions i’ve seen founders hiring for new “formal” positions right out of the gate when all they need are operators to validate the business and find product market fit instead of finding your next vp of whatever or chief whatever officer you should have no titles until you have paying customers and a product market fit i advise all the founding team to call themselves “product” on slide decks and email signature if you do that sort of thing early stage team members should not be going to conferences and don’t need business cards so the title doesn’t matter here are a few other ways to manage the early stage hiring processes and run your startup more effectively maintain equilibrium last year i wrote a piece called “the holy trinity of product development” i argued that it’s important to maintain balance in a company often a startup’s first hires besides the founders tend to skew either to the technology side we need  developers or the marketing side generally if the founding team is more marketingminded they overhire engineers and viceversa instead a company should be customercentric to achieve this “holy grail” the company needs both technology and marketing expertise be wellrounded in another article “why ctos should know accounting” i suggested that ctos also need to understand the business side of your company it’s important for all of the highlevel employees in a company to be able to converse with the rest of the employees just like the ceo of a company should be able to at least pronounce the word “kanban” conban not canban and know the difference between java and javascript a cto should be relatively familiar with balance sheets income and cash flow annual statements and budgets how to hire i’d argue that it’s better not to even bother with interviews rather have coffee first discuss why they want to work at such an early stage company and review their skills there if that goes well then have the potential employee give a presentation to the entire team it can be on any topic was “the force awakens a remake or not” is a perfect choice and it gives the team a feel for the candidate’s analytical skills seriousness about the position and ability to do something different while it also provides a unique experience for the candidate if the person is successful on their hiring presentation i’d suggest the “can we have a beer with them” final check this one’s really complicated – take them out for a beer with the team or another social engagement if team members don’t drink get to know them on a personal level when companies scale to be over  people it is much harder to do this with the whole company but each functional area marketingsales tech backoffice can do it with their group and a select few members from other functional groups to join avoid founder disputes early stage companies sometimes have no cash and bring on someone as a “cofounder” with little to no pay it’s also crucial that you do your best to avoid founder disputes i wrote a piece on this called “dynamic founder agreements” but i’ll give you a short summary i described this agreement like a typical ifthenelse if the cto works fulltime and performs all of coding and technical duties of v his equity is  vestedover  years  year cliff elseif the cto works part time is disengaged or we need to hire developers sooner than expected his vested equity is reduced by half and he forfeits his unvested equity loses board seat endif the cto has to leave the company because he needs a job or a family emergency  if the cto built v then the buyout is a one time payout of  usd cash or  vested equity if the cto did not build v the buyout is  vested equity loses board seat while you might not avoid all disputes this agreement will go a long way hiring for bigger companies once your company grows and matures deliberately hire slow scale and move fast does not mean hire crazy fast rather hire for a role only when it is obvious the company is suffering without it there is a silicon valley secret that dictates that “you make a decision to join a company only if they are resourceconstrained once they have enough people time to move on” the idea behind this secret is that creativity needs constraints translation if your plan calls for ten people see what you can do with five use these tips when building out your initial team don’t fall into the hiring

because of severe proteincalorie malnutrition resulting in infection and an inability to produce sufficient tissue to repair a bowel leak for the next  years regardless of all medical interventions which included diet major supplements predigested protein etc the severe protein malnutrition continued as evidenced by regular prealbumin blood tests that range from  mgdl to  mgdl typically remaining around  mgdl normal range is  to  mgdl this resulted in my body’s inability to repair tissue a paper cut took  weeks to heal extreme debilitating fatigue inflammation etc the medical conclusion was that i no longer was abe to adequately assimilate nutrients from food and supplements when i was introduced to forte elements amino acids my prealbumin level was  mgdl within  weeks of drinking forte elements amino acids once daily as recommended my prealbumin level dramatically increased to  mgdl inside the normal range nothing else in my diet was altered i have since had
