factory skip to main content search form search john b rogers jr president ceo  cofounder local motors while the big three car manufacturers gasp for breath in detroit bostonbased entrepreneur and car designer jay rogers is working up a different type of automotive industry  as ceo and cofounder local motors rogers is about to put a thoroughly new vehicle on the road  called the rally fighter it was crafted through opensource design on the company web site and is being built in regional microfactories which represent a unique collaboration between smallvolume manufacturing and carloving communities local motors has taken the opensource concept to the extreme  design competitions attract entries from designers and engineers around the globe and garner votes from car fanatics of all stripes  once the body of the car has been voted on other details such as interiors sidevents and roofmounted light bars are “masscustomized” with web input from additional competitions  the development of the car becomes a community project  in keeping with the “local” feel of the company competition parameters request designs for specific regions—like boston where pollution traffic and baffling roadways have made driving an aggravation in this historic cityscape  opensource car design seems like a good idea until you see the winning local motors sketches  then it becomes a fantastic idea  if all goes according to plan the uniquely inspired cars that local motors will put on the american road are nothing short of gorgeous  and the combination of the engineer’s artistic vision and community approval makes every local motors vehicle a perfect match for the locality that produces it  rogers sees a national network of “microfactories” employing local workers “blue collar white collar and green collar” using locallymade parts when available “it’s better for the environment to buy those things locally” and customizing products that the community actually wants he expects this confluence to trigger an ecosystem of entrepreneurship for businesses that want to build components or aftermarket addons “when you consider the wealth that local motors will accrue the lion’s share of it won’t accrue to our business alone” rogers says  “our vision is big—really big  and it’s exciting to our customers” local motors already has over  deposits for its first completed product—the  rally fighter that is designed for baja and offroad racing and is also onroad legal  admittedly it’s a car for enthusiasts with deep pockets but not too deep when you consider that the offroad community often pays upwards of  for a trophy truck “more importantly it’s an experience and a car” says rogers—and one that he hopes will transform automotive manufacturing in a substantial way from conception to finished product new cars typically take five to six years to roll off the manufacturing line  the rally fighter will hit the road eighteen months after its competitionwinning design was put on the drawing board  rogers attributes the speed of local motors production to the company’s streamlined manufacturing operation a willingness to work with many offtheshelf parts and the collaborative input of enthusiasts and customers at the core of rogers’s business philosophy is a staunch american patriotism  with a princeton undergraduate degree and an mba from harvard he has had the best education america has to offer—unless of course you join the marines—which he did he says the time he spent in iraq china and thailand has shown him how our global energy interests are costing lives  henry ford didn’t have such concerns when he created the modern assembly line a hundred years ago  as rogers points out ford needed to create a mass production methodology that would generate reliable production at low cost  “consumers at the time didn’t worry about pollution and energy” he says  “but the world is a completely different place now  there is mass production all over the world and availability of parts almost to an infinite degree  now we’re seeing other things  today we have great concerns over what cars do to the environment” keeping it local and responding to american needs and interests is of great concern to rogers “as a marine as a person as a diehard american it’s critically important to me” he says  and he’s confident that this policy will be the best asset local motors has to offer  “there’s no question in my mind that the us is the most innovative country i’ve ever been in” wwwlocalmotorscom   videos john b rogers at bif theres a new car in town
