     see accompanying notes to interim financial statements                gold torrent inc notes to interim financial statements nine months ended december   and  unaudited  expressed in us dollars    nature of operations and going concern   gold torrent inc the “company” was incorporated as a nevada company on august   at the time of its inception the company created tested and developed mobile applications games and tools designed to engage consumers in transacting business via mobile devices on november   the company entered into a spinoff agreement the “agreement” with a company controlled by a former shareholder to sell all intellectual property and assets associated with the previous business of the company pursuant to which the company was released from certain liabilities amounting to    during the fiscal year ended march   the company entered into an exploration and option to enter joint venture agreement with a third party note    the company has incurred losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of  march     as of december   with limited resources and limited source of operating cash flows as of december   the company’s working capital deficiency was  march   –    the company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent on the success of the efforts of its directors and principal stockholders in providing financial support in the shortterm raising additional capital through equity or debt financing either from its own resources or from third parties and achieving profitable operations in the event that such resources are not secured the assets may not be realized or liabilities discharged at their carrying amounts and the difference from the carrying amounts reported in these unaudited interim financial statements could be material there is no assurance that management’s plan to seek additional capital will be realized and these factors cast substantial doubt upon the use of the going concern assumption   these unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of the assets or the amounts and classifications of the liabilities that may result from the inability of the company to continue as a going concern    significant accounting policies     a basis of presentation   these unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the company’s functional and reporting currency is the us dollar   these unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments all of which are normal and recurring in nature that in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the interim financial information the results of operations for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the entire fiscal year ending march   certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap have been condensed or omitted these unaudited interim financial statements and notes included herein have been prepared on a basis consistent with and should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended march   as filed in its form k                gold torrent inc notes to interim financial statements nine months ended december   and  unaudited  expressed in us dollars    significant accounting policies continued     b use of estimates   the preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including but not limited to those related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities the fair value of warrants attached to common shares issued the fair value of shares issued for services the fair value of stock options granted and the recoverability of income tax assets   while management believes the estimates used are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates and could impact future results of operations and cash flows     c basic and diluted earnings loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings loss per share assumes the exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and warrants however the calculation of diluted loss per share excludes the effects of various conversions and exercise of options and warrants that would be antidilutive     d foreign currency translation   transactions in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities expenses are translated at the average rates for the period except amortization which is translated on the same basis as the related assets resulting translation gains or losses are reflected in net incomeloss     e financial instruments   all financial instruments are classified as one of the following heldtomaturity loans and receivables heldfortrading availableforsale or other financial liabilities financial assets and liabilities heldfortrading are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in net income financial assets heldtomaturity loans and receivables and other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method availableforsale instruments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in stockholders’ equity   a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value     i level  – applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities         ii level  – applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or indirectly such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions         iii level  – applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable market data                gold torrent inc notes to interim financial statements nine months ended december   and  unaudited  expressed in us dollars    significant accounting policies continued     e financial instruments continued   transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments that are classified as heldtomaturity loans and receivables or other financial liabilities are included in the initial carrying value of such instruments and amortized using the effective interest method transaction costs classified as heldfortrading are expensed when incurred while those classified as availableforsale are included in the initial carrying value     f income taxes   the company uses the asset and liability approach in its method of accounting for income taxes that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities the company recognizes the effect of uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position could be sustained where the tax benefit has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon settlement a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if based upon available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized     g sharebased payments   the company records all sharebased payments at fair value where equity instruments are granted to employees they are recorded at the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date the grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss over the vesting period described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied   where equity instruments are granted to nonemployees they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received when the value of goods or services received in exchange for the sharebased payment cannot be reliably estimated the fair value is measured by use of a valuation model   at each balance sheet date the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected to vest on the exercise of stock options common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts previously recorded to contributed surplus the company uses the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payments     h exploration and evaluation   the company is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred an impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral property impairment losses if any are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral property over its estimated fair value     i recent accounting guidance adopted   the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect these pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed and the company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations                gold torrent inc notes to interim financial statements nine months ended december   and  unaudited  expressed in us dollars    financial instruments   the company has designated its cash as heldfortrading and accounts payable accrued liabilities and stockholders’ loans as other financial liabilities     a fair value   the fair values of the company’s cash accounts payable accrued liabilities and stockholders’ loans approximate their carrying values due to the shortterm maturity of these instruments     b credit risk   credit risk is the risk of potential loss to the company if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations the company is not exposed to significant credit risk as of december       c translation risk

of  in accounting and legal fees  in exploration and evaluation costs  in executive compensation  in licenses and fees  in bank charges and finance fees  in travel costs and  in office expenses our total expenses are significantly higher the variation in expenses is mainly due to the higher development and exploration fees related to the lucky shot property start up   for the nine months ended

expenses is mainly due to the higher accounting and legal fees and development cost and decreased finance fees due to the payment of loans                liquidity and capital resources   we have limited operational history and did not generate any revenues besides the gain on settlement of debt as of december   we had  in cash and prepaid expenses  in total liabilities and a working capital deficiency of  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we are dependent on funds raised through equity financing related parties and loan payables our operations were funded by equity financing and advances from shareholders and former and current related parties we anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next  months continues to be uncertain   during the nine months ended december   we used  in cash on continuing operating activities and paid back  in loans and received net  from cash provided by financing activities invested  in land and decreased cash by  during the same period in fiscal  we used  in cash on continuing operating activities and paid back  in loans and increased cash by

parties our cash of  as of december   is not sufficient to cover our current monthly burn rate for the foreseeable future and not enough to pay our current liabilities balance of  until we are able to complete private andor public financing as described below we anticipate that we will rely on loans from shareholders to proceed with our plan of operations   our business strategy going forward is to acquire ownership in latestage exploration to developmentstage gold mining projects andor royalty or streaming interests in low capital intensity mining projects in north america our main focus will be on identifying solid resources and then utilize funding to bring a distressed asset into production while either securing equity ownership or rights of title in the form of royalties   we expect to require approximately  in equity funds and up to  to  million in project funds to carry out our business strategy our plan of operations over the next  months is to obtain the necessary financing to earn at least an additional  interest in the lucky shot project by expending  million and advance the project to production we also are seeking financing to earn the full  interest available if we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require we will not be able to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available financial resources   future financings   we have not generated any revenues have achieved losses since our inception and rely upon the sale of our securities loans and advances from current related parties to fund our operations we anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and we are dependent upon obtaining outside financing to carry out our operations our unaudited financial statements for the three months ended december   have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   we will require approximately  over the next  months in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations including paying our ongoing expenses these cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources accordingly we intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next  months from private placements advances from related parties or possibly a registered public offering either selfunderwritten or through a brokerdealer or from third party investors including streaming royalty and lending investors if we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans on september   we signed a nonbinding term sheet with a prospective project investor that had a day exclusivity period ending october  for lucky shot project finance which expired at that time on november   we signed a nonbinding term sheet with a prospective project investor that has a day exclusivity period ending december  for lucky shot project finance on november  the company accompanied a prospective investor to the lucky shot underground workings and to the various surface sites on a due diligence visit in alaska the due diligence work and preparation of documents related to the prospective investor are continuing through this reporting period there is no guarantee that any financing will be available to us or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us                if we are unable to obtain the necessary additional financing then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our operations so as not to exceed the amount of capital resources that are available to us if we do not secure additional financing our current cash reserves and working capital will not be sufficient to enable us to sustain our operations for the next  months even if we do decide to scale back our operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies   our unaudited interim financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation a complete summary of these policies is included in note  of the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements we have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by our management   foreign currency translation   our unaudited financial statements are presented in united states dollars transactions in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities expenses are translated at the average rates for the period excluding amortization which is translated on the same basis as the related assets resulting translation gains or losses are reflected in net loss   sharebased payments   the company records all sharebased payments at fair value where equity instruments are granted to employees they are recorded at the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date the grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss over the vesting period described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied   where equity instruments are granted to nonemployees they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received when the value of goods or services received in exchange for the sharebased payment cannot be reliably estimated the fair value is measured by use of a valuation model   at each balance sheet date the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected to vest on the exercise of stock options common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts previously recorded to contributed surplus the company uses the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payments   recent accounting guidance adopted   the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect these pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed and the company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   inflation   the amounts presented in the unaudited interim financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position the net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments                item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by  cfr  fi and are not

framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of march   we determined that there were significant deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below    we do not have a majority of independent directors we have no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time      all cash management is conducted solely by the company’s officers which may result in the misappropriation of funds      the lack of independent directors exercising an oversight role increases the risk of management override and potential fraud      we are in the development stage with limited resources and limited monitoring of internal control and assessment of risk is conducted   management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies   in light of the existence of these control deficiencies management concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls   as a result management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of
