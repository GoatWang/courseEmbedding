short on chutzpah as a rule but it takes a special kind of cheek to ask investors at this very tender moment in the housing market for  million to fund a new company specializing in subprime residential mortgage loansmichael w vranos celebrity bond trader and founder of ellington management has that audacity and then somemr vranos oversees  billion in hedge funds and private accounts and an additional  billion in a managed account while also managing almost  billion in collateralized debt obligations pools of loans backed by assets like home loans or credit card debtthat might be enough to keep others busy but mr vranos is also peddling shares in a new entity called ellington financial llc an offering statement dated july  began circulating on wall street last week it is a private placement aimed solely at institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies friedman billings ramsey is the underwriter advertisement continue reading the main story on its face it may sound like a promising deal for speculators subprime loans are in the tank as everyone knows surely there is money to be made picking up distressed properties for pennies on the dollar continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story and isn’t mr vranos one of the world’s leading experts on mortgage securities the ellington prospectus certainly confirms this “he was praised during the difficult bear market of  by jack welch chairman of kidder peabody’s parent company general electric” it noted “who said that mr vranos ‘has done a better job than  percent of the managers at ge at managing a cycle’ ”when mr vranos was head of the mortgage securities trading desk at kidder peabody back in the early s fortune magazine called him “one of the best bond traders on wall street” the filing boaststhe filing is silent however on a near calamity mr vranos had with his fund during the financial crisis of  when long term capital management imploded that fall credit markets seized three hedge funds run by mr vranos lost about  percent of their value but stabilized after he auctioned  billion in securities to meet margin callsellington management has obviously thrived since then the filing shows that since  mr vranos has handily beaten the fixedincome average producing doubledigit gains in all those years but twohis performance so far this year is not as stellar at the end of may his mortgagebacked credit funds were up  percent his “composite” hedge fund return for the period is  percentbut is now the time to raise  million in permanent capital on a subprime spending spreesubprime mortgage loans are certainly far cheaper now than they were just a few months ago still the shakeout in the industry may have only just begun last week major lenders like washington mutual and countrywide financial said they would no longer offer the most popular subprime loans those carrying low two or threeyear fixed rates that then reset to much higher levels as access to those loans is cut off subprime borrowers will have greater difficulty refinancing billions in mortgages whose rates are shooting up right now defaults are likely to rise even from today’s high levelsgranted timing is everything in market matters — and mr vranos certainly has been through his share of up and down cycles newsletter sign up continue reading the main

see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime yet the timing of ellington financial’s hopedfor debut is intriguing because it appears to be a way for mr vranos to unload subprime assets he bought a few months ago at higher prices than they would likely fetch today on investors advertisement continue reading the main story some  million of the offering’s proceeds is expected to go toward buying equity in something called spyridon holdings which owns a real estate investment trust that mr vranos’s management company formed in may  it bought  million of the riskiest portions of mortgage pools known as equity residuals issued by the new century financial corporation a subprime lender that declared bankruptcy in april new century made the loans from  to  the filing saidthe  million earmarked from ellington financial’s investors to buy those assets will cover about  percent of the roughly  million spyridon put up to buy them — it borrowed the rest in return ellington financial investors will receive  percent of spyridonbut what inquiring ellington investors should want to know is exactly how those new century residuals are being valued and whether that amount reflects reality or fantasythe ellington prospectus says that the amount to be paid estimated at  million will be based “on fair market valuations of the new century residuals provided at the time of purchase by one or more independent third parties” but ellington goes on to say that it expects any difference between those valuations and the  million purchase price to reflect only whatever cash the assets have distributed to spyridon since they were bought and “any changes in interest rates over the course of such period” some  million in cash has been distributed by the new century residuals the filing saidno mention is made about the decline since may in the values of subprime loans over all and in new century loans in particular even the lender’s highgrade paper is taking a hit — last week standard  poor’s downgraded by one notch several aaarated new century securities consisting of second lien assetsthe problem traders say is that residual interests in new century mortgage securities are not trading so any valuation of the  million stake will likely be based on a model not a true market besides if the assets were such a good trade for mr vranos investors might be wondering why is he sharing that largessasked friday whether the offering is a way to dump poorly performing securities onto investors for a higherthanmarket price mr vranos first said that i should not have obtained a copy of the prospectus because it is a private placement all he would say about the new century residuals is “i don’t know if they’ve declined i’m not responsible for pricing them — we use thirdparty pricing that’s obviously a question that potential limiteds ask all the time obviously we have an answer”josh rosner an authority on mortgagebacked securities at grahamfisher an independent research firm in new york looked at the ellington financial filing details that i forwarded to him he said “if you are exposed to significant losses on a marktomarket basis your goal is within the legal framework to avoid having to take that mark one of the ways that people are starting to avoid that is to resecuritize assets and put them into other vehicles at par i think there is a strong chance that may be what’s happening here”so in addition to jettisoning some of the new century residuals the transaction with ellington financial may allow mr vranos to value those that he owns elsewhere in his financial empire at a higher price than he otherwise could advertisement continue reading the main story hedge funds are unregulated entities and they want to remain that way that is fine with me but transactions like this one seem almost certain to draw scrutiny and hedge fund managers as smart as mr vranos should know that
