needs about our syndication service official review july st  pm rating reviewed by jeff stone for  bucks you get a  disk set of jay fortune interviewing jonathan goodwin  tracks and disturbing images burned into your brain so deep that even will smith and tommy lee jones cant erase them its kind of tricky to review something like this its an interview i could rate it on if i liked what the interview was about but just because i liked it doesnt mean you will i could grade it on product quality but its just a couple of disks with a handful of audio tracks i could rate it on the content but it was just a bunch of interview questions and stuff about goodwins many tv shows and experiences the bottom line is how willing are you to spend  on  minutes of interview time regardless of how good it is my gut tells me i need to eat less cheese but it also tells me that most people would not be willing to spend  to listen to an interview even a really good one lets look at it this way take
