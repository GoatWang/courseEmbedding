search search how risky is magellan midstream partners lp three key metrics suggest that this mlp is fairly low risk though those numbers alone don’t mean this investment is riskfree matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at am magellan midstream partners nysemmp operates a relatively lowrisk business model since the bulk of its earnings come from an extensive portfolio of feebased pipelines and storage terminals however building that stable portfolio is just one of the steps the company has taken to keep risk at bay heres a closer look at how it stacks up against its peers and how its lower risk profile has helped the company overcome obstacles in the past so it could continue paying a growing distribution to investors drilling down into the numbers three critical numbers for mlp investors are the percentage of cash flow underpinned by fees the distribution coverage ratio and the leverage ratio heres how magellan midstream partners metrics compare to several notable rivals company debttoadjusted ebitda current distribution coverage ratio  of cash flow feebased or regulated  enterprise products partners nyseepd  times  times  magellan midstream partners  times  times  plains all american pipeline nysepaa  times  times  williams partners nysewpz  times  times  data source magellan midstream partners enterprise products partners plains all american pipeline and williams partners as that chart shows magellan midstream partners has some of the most conservative metrics in its peer group its leverage ratio for example is well under  times which is considered a safe zone for mlps likewise the company can currently cover its generous payout with room to spare since it has one of the highest coverage ratios in the group those two metrics when combined with the fact that feebased contracts underpin about  of its cash flow is why the company has one of the best credit ratings among mlps tied with enterprise products partners that said if there is one concern with those metrics its that fees only underpin  of cash flow which is the lowest in the group this factor has had an impact on the company in recent years for example last year distributable cash flow barely budged despite the completion of several growth projects meanwhile the company was only able to reaffirm its guidance for  even after securing a new contract for a recently completed project because the cash flow from that agreement would only offset the negative impact that weakerthanexpected commodity prices are having on earnings however with ample distribution coverage the company has plenty of cushion to ensure that it can continue paying its distribution even if prices remain weak which puts its payout on a much more sustainable footing than plains all american pipelines since its just barely covering its distribution meanwhile the company continues investing capital in building more feebased assets that should further mute its direct exposure to commodity prices  image source getty images risk mitigation in action magellan midstream partners numbers suggest that it shouldnt have any problem maintaining its payout even if it runs into an unexpected issue that has certainly been the case during the recent oil market downturn since it has been able to not only maintain its payout but has joined enterprise products partners as one of the few mlps that has continued growing its distribution  one reason magellan has been able to do this is due to its topnotch balance sheet which has proven to be a competitive advantage during the downturn because it has been able to access capital at a much cheaper rate than rivals for example williams partners had to offer a  interest rate to entice investors to buy the  billion of year debt it was selling early last year when it needed cash for a looming debt maturity and to finance expansion meanwhile plains all american pipeline had to offer an  yielding preferred to get the  billion it needed last year to fund expansion projects contrast those rates with the  that magellan locked in when it offered  million of year notes early last year so that it could refinance debt and fund growth projects given their much higher capital costs both williams partners and plains all american pipelines would go on to slash their payouts by double digits last year to shore up their financial situations meanwhile because magellan had no problem accessing the capital it needed it was able to increase its payout by  last year and is on pace to grow it by  in  and by the same rate in  investor takeaway magellan midstream partners boasts some of the most conservative financial metrics in its peer groups those have proven to be a crucial advantage in recent years because theyve allowed the company to overcome several obstacles that history demonstrates to investors that magellan is a lowrisk company that has the financial strength to make it through tough times   matt dilallo owns shares of enterprise products partners the

lp buy the dip after a big run leading into  enterprise products partners is off around  from its high should you be buying this dip reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer jun   at am enterprise products partners lp nyseepd is one of the largest oil and natural gas midstream partnerships in the country and its shares have fallen roughly  since hitting a peak in february is it time for you to start adding this industry giant to your portfolio the numbers say yes here are six things you need to know before you pull the trigger  scale enterprise is one of the largest midstream companies in the united states that means growth will be slower than at a smaller industry player but it also means the partnership can take on deals and projects that not many of its peers could handle so scale has its advantages image source getty images enterprise is also one of the most diversified midstream names partially a function of its size it owns pipelines storage facilities products terminals processing plants and even a fleet of ships it has assets spread across a huge swatch of the country that means if one product it moves or regional area is under pressure enterprise has the flexibility to adjust its business to deal with the issue    throughput not commodities the vast majority of enterprises business is feebased this point isnt unique to enterprise for example holly energy partners gets  of its revenues from fees but it is still an important reason for owning enterprise essentially a feebased business means that the price of oil and natural gas has a limited impact on enterprises business demand is a much more important determinant of success to give you an idea of what this means oil prices tumbled in mid and still hadnt fully recovered by year end  but over that span enterprises core distributable cash flow grew from  billion to  billion thats not amazing growth but it happened at a time when oil prices fell from over  a barrel to around  at the worst point withstanding that kind of price drop highlights the value of enterprises business model even if it isnt unique   enterprises results held up well even during a deep oil downturn image source enterprise products partners lp  buying growth another benefit of enterprises size is that it allows the midstream giant to make big moves in down markets for example it completed the acquisition of its oil tankers business in early  while oil prices were still falling and more recently it bought the midstream assets of azure midstream partners at a bankruptcy auction both show enterprises ability to expand its business opportunistically in downturns so it can come out the other side a stronger company of course downturns arent the only time it expands this way but the ability to take a contrarian stance is a key differentiating factor that said to give you a broader sense of the companys history enterprise has spent  billion on acquisitions since its initial public offering in   a builder while acquisitions are an important piece of the growth equation for enterprise it isnt the only thing to watch construction is another key avenue for growth on that front the partnership has  billion of growth projects in the works between now and    enterprise is building its business from the ground up image source enterprise products partners lp image httpphxcorporateirnetexternalfileitemugfyzwsuqnjczmtufenoawxksuqmzgwotqffrcgumqt page  size is important here too because enterprise can comfortably take on projects that smaller peers dont have the scale to get done in fact enterprise has spent around  billion on organic growth projects since it came public far more than its spent on acquisitions    good quarter that said you might be asking whats going on today at enterprise motley fools tyler crowe recently highlighted the good news here in the first quarter enterprise saw nice jumps in net income earnings and distributable cash flow year over year and sequentially compared to the fourth quarter all three had been in something of a holding pattern during the oil downturn with new assets offsetting slow demand for existing assets   with drilling activity picking up in the united states however enterprises expansion efforts are really starting to show results assuming this trend continues the partnership should have a pretty good year  distribution all of this leads to a discussion of the partnerships distribution which is likely what attracted you to enterprise in the first place for starters it offers a robust  distribution yield thats toward the high end of its historical range the distribution was covered by  times in the first quarter which provides plenty of safety and room for future increases   note that the distribution was increased by  in the quarter marking the st consecutive quarter in which enterprise has upped the disbursement however the longer streak is   the number of consecutive years that enterprise has increased its distribution if you like dividend increases enterprise has you covered   would there be a bad time to buy all in enterprise is likely among the bestrun participants in the oil and natural gas midstream industry in fact some might argue that theres never a bad time to buy this limited partnership for longterm investors seeking income thats hyperbole of course but today after a  pullback is certainly not a bad time with a wellcovered  distribution yield and two decades worth of dividend growth behind it investors would be well served to do a deep dive here reuben
