bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose

with at least a year history morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations in a funds monthly performance and does not take into account the effects of sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the weights are  year rating for

construction independent  employee owned enter our history ceo peter algert established the firm with the goal of becoming recognized as bestinclass in systematic active equity investing founded in  and  employeeowned algert global focuses on managing global absolute return and active longonly strategies for both institutional and private investors  the core investment team has worked together since  and each member can demonstrate a deep academic background in quantitative investing  prior to creating algert global peter served as the global head of research for barclays global investors stock selection strategies our investment philosophy we believe there are inefficiencies in global equity markets that result from the behavioral biases of human market participants and are best exploited by a quantitative and repeatable investment process our process utilizes three manifestations of market inefficiencies in conjunction with one another to develop a single conviction alpha score on every stock in our investment universe    markets misestimate company growth rates   as a result we look to own companies that we believe are cheap relative to peers   markets inefficiently forecast the sustainability of firm earnings   as a result we look to own companies whose earnings we believe will be sustainable     markets often react irrationally to new information   as a result we look to own companies for which market sentiment and attention is increasing such that we believe the market is likely to converge to our viewpoint and price   relative value quality catalyst investment process we employ a systematic fundamental investment process to derive a proprietary stock ranking for each company within our respective investment universe the alpha scores represent our view of the attractiveness of the company relative to its industry peers our stock rankings are updated every day through seven distinct regional modeling processes that run around the clock hundreds of daily processes accumulate and store new information from our numerous data sources and reestimate our ranking for each stock in our universe using the updated stock rankings our portfolios are automatically optimized and a prospective trade list is generated reviewed and approved by a model manager prior to submitting to the market for execution  we implement these ideas systematically removing emotion from any buy and sell decisions risk management risk management is intrinsically part of our investment process  every signal we produce is “neutralized” to the key risk factors we wish to manage eg beta countries industries and size our final stock ranking is designed to be free from any bias or tendency to overweight or underweight these risk factors in addition our portfolio construction and trading process overlays several additional risk management controls   we use an optimizer to build our portfolio from our stock score risk exposures and covariances and liquidity and transaction cost forecasts the goal of the optimization is to maximize our portfolio’s exposure to our proprietary stock ranking without taking excessive risk to common factors for which we have no forecast we bound positions according to both their proportion of the portfolio and their percentage of daily liquidity prior to trading the model manager reviews the trade list for any news that might have invalidated the stock ranking for a given stock eg an announced takeover the model manager has limited discretion only to take risk “off the table” in these circumstances technology as a pioneer in quantitative equity modeling and portfolio construction algert global invests heavily in data and the development of systems to analyze equities and manage portfolios  we were data scientists long before the phrase became popular and have built a highly scalable and efficient platform that leverages our team’s capabilities in research risk modeling and portfolio management  over three hundred automated processes are managed each day to integrate data feeds from our vendors and update our models our investment strategies global equity market neutral us small cap equities

source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration
