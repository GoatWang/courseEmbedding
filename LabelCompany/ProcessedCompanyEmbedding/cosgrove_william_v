modified kings headrest the kapp king’s headrest is used to position the patient’s head during all surgical procedures during surgery the headrest can position and stabilize the patient’s head at various angles relative to the configuration of the surgical table × hardy spinal retractor indications the retractor for transthoracic disc excisions through limited exposure it also can be used for lumbar laminectomies and could be adapted for transabdominal exposures for cage insertion or other applications × stripts sterile adhesive surgical organizer surgical instrument organizer keeps tethered instruments from falling on the floor sterile selfadhesive stript’s holds and organizes all surgical tubes scopes and instruments when attached to any location on the surgical field economical and easy to use × radial head implants  custom approved for patient match  off the shelf consignment for use of the radial head prosthesis including radial head fractures not amenable to fixation radiocapitellar arthropathy due to degeneration or malunion of a radial head fracture complex fracture dislocation of the elbow with loss of radial head support and essexlopresti fracturedislocation with loss of the radial head rupture of the interosseous membrane and disruption of the distal radioulnar joint in these cases landsman and seitz have shown silastic to be inadequate metallic replacement to be stable and biologic reconstruction to be promising but unproven and with the potential for high degree of complications  the “offtheshelf” prosthesis which are available are relatively few and are extremely expensive what the surgeon finds is that the limited available sizes fit no particular anatomy perfectly in general one size fits a limited few patients correctly but will not fit all patients the question which must be asked is why not provide a custom prosthesis which is easy to insert and provides a degree of stability necessary for these complex injuries × total shoulder instruments kapp surgical offers a complete line of shoulder instruments all instruments are custom designed for maximum reliability and strength they are made of the highest quality stainless steel × total knee retractors indications one set of  soft tissue  bone retractors used to expose the distal femur  proximal tibia to allow precise saw cuts these stainless steel retractors will protect the posterior cruciate ligament and the mediallateral ligaments during the total knee implant surgery × surgical knee immobilizer this sterile disposable knee immobilizer stabilizes the knee for total knee implant reconstruction it is disposable and is used to keep the knee stable in both flexion and extension position × special flexor tendon clamps the fang is used to hold flexor tendons during tendon repair some instruments used in flexor tendon repair “crush” the tendon and can lead to stimulation of the scar response and subsequent adhesion formation while other instruments that transfix the tendon may not adequately immobilize the tendon ends to be sutured and make for a difficult and potential traumatic repair the fang transfixes the tendon close to the cut ends via two needle size teeth directed in an anterior to posterior direction this is done without crushing the tendon or stimulating the epitenon and allows well controlled passage of suture into the tendon end a variety of different suture techniques can be utilized a stop prevents the fang from closing on the tendon and contacting the epitenon and essentially allows for a “touchless” technique × radial  ulnar head implants “the patient match implant philosophy has the metal conforming to the bone as opposed to the offtheshelf implant which has the bone surgically altered to meet the metal the seitz solution implants are individually designed to fit the patient’s anatomic bone structure” william h seitz jr md – cleveland orthopedic and spine hospital at lutheran – cleveland clinic foundation cleveland ohio × special coned heparin needles these coned heparin tips are used to flush saline heparin solution through various sizes fo veins and arteries the cone design allows the veinartery to secure itself at the proximal end for maximum infiltration as shorter length can be manufactured at your request when ordering please specify short ” or long ” other sizes and styles are available for special orders × modified javid clamps the modified javid clamps are used to secure various sized shunts used during carotid endarterectomy procedures and are manufactured in three sizes with soft rubber inserts also they are designed to close gradually on the first ratchet the tips remain open approximately  to  millimeters and close completely on the last ratchet this new design will prevent damage to the intima of arteries due to the surgeon’s gradual clamping control and rubber inserts × martinez clamps angled clamp with cooley teeth these cvt surgical clamps are ideally suited for clamping of arteries located in the depths and superficial vessels of the surgical field the double angulation of the clamp permits placement of its handle to one side allowing an unobstructed view of the operative field the instrument is manufactured in pairs each being the mirror image of the other for use on one side or the other depending on the circumstance the martinez clamp angled clamp is designed to control the internal external and common carotid arteries during carotid endarterectomies for the control of brachial artery during thrombectomy andor repair following cardiac catheterizaton and for profunda femoris artery control during femoral artery procedures × loop aorta cvtsoft jaw aorta clamp we have devised a light strong clamp for use on the distal ascending aorta its advantages are that it may be used with “cushioned jaws” or similar padded inserts and it conforms to the depth of the superior mediastinum the clamp lies flat against the neck and does not protrude near the operative field × disjointed aneurysm clamps this cleveland clinic designed disjointed aneurysm clamp is used to clamp the aorta at the neck of the aneurysm vertically for the humphries clamp and horizontally for the beven clamp the size used will depend on the size fo the aorta the humphries clamp is handed to the surgeon with the lock side in the down position then the other half of the clamp × bulldog clamps unlike all other bulldog clamps these clamps give the surgeon complete control of the pressure required as needed the vast range of pressure from very weak to very strong allowed by this bulldog clamp can be attributed to its unique design and variable spring these clamps are manufactured straight ” and ” long also ” long with a right angle ” tip if desired × baby renal clamps these cvt surgical clamps are ideally suited for clamping of arteries located in the depths and superficial vessels of the surgical field the double angulation of theclamp permits placement of its handel to one side allowing an unobstructed view of the operative field the instrument is manufactured in pairs each being the mirror image of the other for use to one side or the other depending upon the circumstance the small baby renal clamp angled clamp is designed to control the common carotid arteries during carotid endarterectomies for the control of brachial artery during thrombectomy and or repair following cardiac catheterization and for profunda femoris artery control during femoral artery procedures × adult renal clamps these cvt surgical clamps are ideally suited for clamping of arteries located in the depths and superficial vessels of the surgical field the double angulation of theclamp permits placement of its handel to one side allowing an unobstructed view of the operative field the instrument is manufactured in pairs each being the mirror image of the other for use to one side or the other depending upon the circumstance the large adult renal clamp angled clamp is designed to control the common iliac artery the external of internal iliac arteries during surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy of for aortoiliac occlusive disese it can also be used for controlling the distal external iliac artery during aortobidrmoral bypass procedures femoralpopliteal reconstruction profundaplasties or femoral embolectromies ×
