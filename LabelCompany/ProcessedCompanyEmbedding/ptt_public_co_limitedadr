public company to benefit from asean growthaug  about ptt chemical pchuy shelley goldberg macro commodities alternative energy sustainabilityinvestwithpurposesummaryptt chemical public company is set to benefit from asean growthasean member nations energy needs are growingpchuy has lowered its debt and sees opportunities aheadptt chemical public company otcpkpchuy also known as the petroleum authority of thailand public company limited ptt group is the thai stateowned oil and gas company ptt group was formerly known as the petroleum authority of thailand today it owns extensive submarine gas pipelines in the gulf of thailand in addition to a network of lpg terminals throughout the kingdom it is involved in all things energy including upstream and downstream petroleum procurement processing transmission and distribution of natural gas import export and trading of crude oil condensate petroleum petrochemical products and other specialty substances retail sale of natural gas at service stations for light and heavy duty vehicles operation of gas separation units exploration production and distribution of coal distribution of petroleum products and byproducts refining and processing palm oil investments ptt group was founded in  and is headquartered in bangkok in fact its one of the largest corporations in thailand and the only thai company on the fortune  and forbes  lists the stock price of this rather interesting conglomerate has been drifting lower largely as a result of the price of crude oil and other energy commodities falling ptt group the nouvelle energy company for asean but the prospects for growth are exceptionally good if one focuses on the growth of the asean block the association of southeast asian nations and its need for energy now and in the future all you have to do is look at the statistics the number of people living in southeast asia is estimated to grow from todays  million to  million by  and no doubt that will create a massive thirst for energy its a known fact that all asean nations must synergize and develop its people together with its limited natural energy resources to prevent energy shocks driven by global energy security and price volatility sure global energy prices have fallen precipitously  but volatility is here to stay we are now at precarious levels where producers are staring to slow down production which only helps to put upward pressure on crude oil in the near future also we should focus on the strength of the asean nations economies which have seen  growth per year over the last  years the middle class is growing stronger and the people are moving into urban areas leading to greater demand for energy in fact according to asean statistics the group saw  total trades reach  trillion making the region the eighth largest economy globally oil and gas ranks no  in size in terms of intraasean trading by industry here are some of ptts initiatives in the asean block country initiatives brunei helped local producers to increase the value of their export crude oil products through trading in the global market cambodia supplying the lpg and petroleum products for domestic consumption indonesia exploring growth opportunity in exploration and production and petrochemical production and trading laos building hydropower and developing oil and retail business malaysia has a joint development area for natural gas myanmar working with the local company to provide petroleum product and improve existing energy infrastructure philippines enhancing its existing petroleum and retail business to better cater to changing lifestyle singapore expanding its crude oil condensate petroleum petrochemical products and other commodities trading vietnam helping to build a large scale petrochemical refinery complex its evident that ptt has made an impact in every asean nation beginning in and as of  ptt has taken the role in asean council on petroleum ascope as its secretary in charge like any emerging market there are risks in february  ptt exploration and production reported its first quarterly net loss in  years with a reported net loss of us million for the octoberdecember  quarter needless to say this news  alongside dropping energy prices  did not bode well for the stock yet as for ptt groups debt moodys investor service maintained ptts final issuer ratings at baa  on par with the sovereign rating  given moodys expectation of a high level of sovereign support moodys stated at the same time ptts strong liquidity profile also continues to support its rating even if earnings come under pressure in this weak operating environment furthermore the company has reduced its debt as of dec   ptt had cash and cash equivalents of thb billion compared to thb billion of debt maturing in the next  months the company also had a wellspreadout maturity profile with around  of its total longterm borrowings maturing after  ptts upstream business  through its owned subsidiary ptt exploration  production public company ltd pttep baa stable  remained the key earnings contributor of the group in q accounting for  of its q ebitda and  of its fullyear ebitda so as we move toward the end of  it might be a good time to start building a position in light of expected future growth in the asean region disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but
