plantsourced saccharides used in its line of ambrotose products glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community in an sec filing the company stated that its products are formulated with predominately sic naturallyoccurring plantderived carbohydratebased ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness rather than developing synthetic carbohydratebased products as other companies are doing scientific evaluationedit independent commentaryedit the opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest ambrotose as it lacks the enzymes needed prominent glycobiologist ronald schnaar told  in a june   interview all of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat hudson freeze a leading

the lack of published clinical benefits of the partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides found in ambrotose complex an article in glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous glyconutrient term the author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the scientificsounding label of glyconutrient which may generate a feeling of security and credibility  despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term in november  science published an article in its news focus section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding mannatech it included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists including ajit varki raymond dwek freeze and schnaar according to the memorial sloan–kettering cancer center mannatech and its founder have been charged by the texas attorney general for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products health benefits ambrotose has been promoted aggressively to cancer patients on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system but that strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking companyfunded studiesedit mannatech has sponsored preclinical and clinical research on their products the company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller absorbable fragments by gi tract bacteria and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity cognition mood and memory marzorati and possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that

glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual nobel prize winners on march   a jury trial was demanded and on september   a classaction lawsuit was filed against mannatech for alleged violations of the securities exchange act the plaintiff class accused mannatech of violating the act by issuing a series of material misrepresentations specifically failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of mannatech products this caused a misleading price inflation of the companys stock the plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of mannatech stock during the period august   through july   on march   mannatech settled the classaction lawsuit by agreeing to pay  million to the plaintiff class as part of the settlement mannatech admitted no wrongdoing texas attorney general civil complaintedit mannatech came under investigation by the texas attorney general on october   for alleged violations of that states deceptive trade practices act samuel l caster mannatechs founder and chief executive officer at the time stated we walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people were not into the treatment cure or mitigation of disease were into the improvement of quality of life now who can benefit from good nutrition sick people well people everybody everybody benefits from good nutrition on july   texas attorney general greg abbott formally charged mannatech mannarelief sam caster and reginald mcdaniel the companys medical director with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law a press release stated todays enforcement action stems from a largescale investigation by state authorities who examined mannatechs dubious claims about the health benefits of its products in response to the civil complaint mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the attorney generals office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines mannatech settled the civil complaint on february   by agreeing to pay  million in restitution to clients who purchased products and  million to the state to cover its costs in the case in addition sam caster agreed to pay a  million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with mannatech for five years when discussing the settlement at a news conference abbot stated bottom line this is a warning to the general public be wary of phony claims of magic cureall pills or false hope in a bottle you could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value mannatech did not admit wrongdoing settling was easier than debating abbott according to thenceo wayne badovinuscitation needed if they do it again we will ensure they get put out of business abbott said one year later mannatech coceo robert sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action saying the civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce we were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit we learned from that chapter and it is closed weve reached a settlement and weve paid the fees associated with it weve done everything in our power to correct that and make sure were in compliance in the future abc investigationedit a  undercover investigation that aired june   on abc television showed mannatechs sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate us federal law including us food and drug administration regulations by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases mannatech ceo sam caster was interviewed for the show and told  that mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products i dont think dietary supplements treat cure mitigate anything it is not meant to substitute a doctors oversight but it plays an important role in the whole health equation company lossesedit mannatech announced in august  that company founder sam caster was stepping down as ceo of mannatech to be replaced by wayne badovinus as the new chief executive several corporate initiatives were undertaken but after  months on the job badovinus resigned in december  another member of the board resigned shortly after mannatechs chief science officer robert sinnott and mannatechs chief financial officer steve fenstermacher were named coceos fenstermacher later resigned publicity over the companys lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance after profits of  million in  and  million in  mannatech reported a  million loss in  and a  million loss in  by midyear  one quarter of mannatechs sales were gone  losses were  million as the companys market capitalizations continued to fall sp indices dropped it from the sp  index stating they are no longer representative of the small cap market space recruiting efforts continued dropping in  widening company losses to  million illegal marketing by uk physicianedit as reported by the british medical journal mannatech distributor vivienne balonwu a uk general practitioner was found by the uk general medical council panel to have abused her power as a doctor after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the companys glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and strokerelated complications following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in  balonwu was dismissed by her employer harmoni a medical services company and the gmc panel imposed a month penalty period during which she was to avoid private or short term locum work and to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice ben carsonedit from  until early  neurosurgeon and conservative speaker ben carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting mannatech and its products after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on august   carson claimed in an interview the following november that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease however in  in a speech at a mannatech event he credited the companys products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms his most recent paid speech for the company was in  for which he was paid  his image appeared on the corporations website in  and in the same year he praised their glyconutrient supplements in a pbs special the missing link – the science of brain health sponsored by a group of mannatech distributors that was subsequently featured on the site carson delivered the keynote address at a mannatech distributor convention in  during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at johns hopkins medicine    three years ago i had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh it requires  million to do an endowed chair and im proud to say that part of that  million came from mannatech in october  carsons campaign team said that there was no contribution from mannatech to johns hopkins and that his statement had been a legitimate mistake on his part confusion he had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time and he simply got things mixed up during the cnbc gop debate on october   carson was asked about his relationship with mannatech he replied thats easy to answer i didnt have any involvement with mannatech total propaganda i did a couple speeches for them i did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches it is absolutely absurd to say i had any kind of relation with them do i take the product yes i think it is a good product politifact rated carsons denial of any involvement as false pointing to his paid speeches for mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products despite not being an official spokesman or sales associate when the cnbc moderator commented that carson was on mannatechs website he replied that he had not given his permission earlier he had said that he was unaware of the companys legal history on november   mannatech said on its website that for compliance with federal

widely known for ambrotose its glyconutritional dietary supplement which is a patented blend of plantsourced saccharides used in its line of ambrotose products glyconutritionals were formulated to support cellular communication by positively impacting human glycoforms a claim that has generated controversy among some members of the scientific community in an sec filing the company stated that its products are formulated with predominately sic naturallyoccurring plantderived carbohydratebased ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness rather than developing synthetic carbohydratebased products as other companies are doing scientific evaluationedit independent commentaryedit the opinion of independent glycobiologists is that the body cannot digest ambrotose as it lacks the enzymes needed prominent glycobiologist ronald schnaar told  in a june   interview all of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat hudson freeze a leading glycobiologist said this about glyconutrients there are authentic scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials and it doesnt really do anything except increase flatulence freeze is a member of the editorial board of glycobiology and schnaar serves as editorinchief schnaar and freeze published a critique of mannatechs products in glycobiology in  describing the lack of published clinical benefits of the partially purified polydisperse plant polysaccharides found in ambrotose complex an article in glycobiology described the potential for the public to be misled about the science of glycobiology by the nebulous glyconutrient term the author expressed concern that the public could be susceptible to the scientificsounding label of glyconutrient which may generate a feeling of security and credibility  despite the lack of acceptance among many glycobiologists of the term in november  science published an article in its news focus section detailing the scientific controversy surrounding mannatech it included criticisms and comments from glycobiologists including ajit varki raymond dwek freeze and schnaar according to the memorial sloan–kettering cancer center mannatech and its founder have been charged by the texas attorney general for deceptive trade practices that exaggerated the products health benefits ambrotose has been promoted aggressively to cancer patients on the basis that it can help cellular health and boost the immune system but that strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking companyfunded studiesedit mannatech has sponsored preclinical and clinical research on their products the company states that these studies indicate that the products can be broken down into smaller absorbable fragments by gi tract bacteria and can modify human serum glycosylation profiles additional studies sponsored by the company have indicated that the products also exert positive prebiotic effects and induce positive effects on human brain wave activity cognition mood and memory marzorati and possemiers employed human gastrointestinal tract simulations and microbiological analysis to show that ambrotose complex and advanced ambrotose powder exerted positive prebiotic effects both products exhibited selective fermentability throughout the entire colon with a positive and selective bifidus factor they also demonstrated the possibility of enhancing species belonging to bacteroidetes a phylum recently associated with body weight management a fiveweek combined phase  and  open label forced titration dose response study of  healthy adults suggested that the ambrotose ao dietary

company has been known for its literature websites and multilevel marketing with claims of scientific links to cellular glycobiology long disputed by relevant individual nobel prize winners on march   a jury trial was demanded and on september   a classaction lawsuit was filed against mannatech for alleged violations of the securities exchange act the plaintiff class accused mannatech of violating the act by issuing a series of material misrepresentations specifically failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of mannatech products this caused a misleading price inflation of the companys stock the plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of mannatech stock during the period august   through july   on march   mannatech settled the classaction lawsuit by agreeing to pay  million to the plaintiff class as part of the settlement mannatech admitted no wrongdoing texas attorney general civil complaintedit mannatech came under investigation by the texas attorney general on october   for alleged violations of that states deceptive trade practices act samuel l caster mannatechs founder and chief executive officer at the time stated we walk the fine line of always stating our case appropriately and always training our people were not into the treatment cure or mitigation of disease were into the improvement of quality of life now who can benefit from good nutrition sick people well people everybody everybody benefits from good nutrition on july   texas attorney general greg abbott formally charged mannatech mannarelief sam caster and reginald mcdaniel the companys medical director with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law a press release stated todays enforcement action stems from a largescale investigation by state authorities who examined mannatechs dubious claims about the health benefits of its products in response to the civil complaint mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the attorney generals office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines mannatech settled the civil complaint on february   by agreeing to pay  million in restitution to clients who purchased products and  million to the state to cover its costs in the case in addition sam caster agreed to pay a  million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with mannatech for five years when discussing the settlement at a news conference abbot stated bottom line this is a warning to the general public be wary of phony claims of magic cureall pills or false hope in a bottle you could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value mannatech did not admit wrongdoing settling was easier than debating abbott according to thenceo wayne badovinuscitation needed if they do it again we will ensure they get put out of business abbott said one year later mannatech coceo robert sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action saying the civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce we were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit we learned from that chapter and it is closed weve reached a settlement and weve paid the fees associated with it weve done everything in our power to correct that and make sure were in compliance in the future abc investigationedit a  undercover investigation that aired june   on abc television showed mannatechs sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate us federal law including us food and drug administration regulations by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases mannatech ceo sam caster was interviewed for the show and told  that mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products i dont think dietary supplements treat cure mitigate anything it is not meant to substitute a doctors oversight but it plays an important role in the whole health equation company lossesedit mannatech announced in august  that company founder sam caster was stepping down as ceo of mannatech to be replaced by wayne badovinus as the new chief executive several corporate initiatives were undertaken but after  months on the job badovinus resigned in december  another member of the board resigned shortly after mannatechs chief science officer robert sinnott and mannatechs chief financial officer steve fenstermacher were named coceos fenstermacher later resigned publicity over the companys lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance after profits of  million in  and  million in  mannatech reported a  million loss in  and a  million loss in  by midyear  one quarter of mannatechs sales were gone  losses were  million as the companys market capitalizations continued to fall sp indices dropped it from the sp  index stating they are no longer representative of the small cap market space recruiting efforts continued dropping in  widening company losses to  million illegal marketing by uk physicianedit as reported by the british medical journal mannatech distributor vivienne balonwu a uk general practitioner was found by the uk general medical council panel to have abused her power as a doctor after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the companys glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and strokerelated complications following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in  balonwu was dismissed by her employer harmoni a medical services company and the gmc panel imposed a month penalty period during which she was to avoid private or short term locum work and to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice ben carsonedit from  until early  neurosurgeon and conservative speaker ben carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting mannatech and its products after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on august   carson claimed in an interview the following november that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease however in  in a speech at a mannatech event he credited the companys products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms his most recent paid speech for the company was in  for which he was paid  his image appeared on the corporations website in  and in the same year he praised their glyconutrient supplements in a pbs special the missing link – the science of brain health sponsored by a group of mannatech distributors that was subsequently featured on the site carson delivered the keynote address at a mannatech distributor convention in  during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at johns hopkins medicine    three years ago i had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh it requires  million to do an endowed chair and im proud to say that part of that  million came from mannatech in october  carsons campaign team said that there was no contribution from mannatech to johns hopkins and that his statement had been a legitimate mistake on his part confusion he had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time and he simply got things mixed up during the cnbc gop debate on october   carson was asked about his relationship with mannatech he replied thats easy to answer i didnt have any involvement with mannatech total propaganda i did a couple speeches for them i did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches it is absolutely absurd to say i had any kind of relation with them do i take the product yes i think it is a good product politifact rated carsons denial of any involvement as false pointing to his paid speeches for mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products despite not being an official spokesman or sales associate when the cnbc moderator commented that carson was on mannatechs website he replied that he had not given his permission earlier he had said that he was unaware of the companys legal history on november   mannatech said on its website that for compliance with federal campaign finance regulations the company had removed all

of the securities exchange act the plaintiff class accused mannatech of violating the act by issuing a series of material misrepresentations specifically failing to control its sales associates and allowing them to make false claims concerning the efficacy of mannatech products this caused a misleading price inflation of the companys stock the plaintiffs consisted of the purchasers of mannatech stock during the period august   through july   on march   mannatech settled the classaction lawsuit by agreeing to pay  million to the plaintiff class as part of the settlement mannatech admitted no

treatment cure or mitigation of disease were into the improvement of quality of life now who can benefit from good nutrition sick people well people everybody everybody benefits from good nutrition on july   texas attorney general greg abbott formally charged mannatech mannarelief sam caster and reginald mcdaniel the companys medical director with operating an illegal marketing scheme in violation of state law a press release stated todays enforcement action stems from a largescale investigation by state authorities who examined mannatechs dubious claims about the health benefits of its products in response to the civil complaint mannatech expanded its compliance department and began to provide periodic reports to the attorney generals office to ensure that the marketing efforts of its affiliate network adhere to appropriate guidelines mannatech settled the civil complaint on february   by agreeing to pay  million in restitution to clients who purchased products and  million to the state to cover its costs in the case in addition sam caster agreed to pay a  million civil penalty and steer clear of any type of leadership position or employment relationship with mannatech for five years when discussing the settlement at a news conference abbot stated bottom line this is a warning to the general public be wary of phony claims of magic cureall pills or false hope in a bottle you could be duped into purchasing something that has no real effect and no real value mannatech did not admit wrongdoing settling was easier than debating abbott according to thenceo wayne badovinuscitation needed if they do it again we will ensure they get put out of business abbott said one year later mannatech coceo robert sinnott reflected on the ramifications of the legal action saying the civil action related mainly to some actions by our salesforce we were embarrassed and also financially impacted by the attorney general suit we learned from that chapter and it is closed weve reached a settlement and weve paid the fees associated with it weve done everything in our power to correct that and make sure were in compliance in the future abc investigationedit a  undercover investigation that aired june   on abc television showed mannatechs sales associates teaching sales recruits how to target mannatech products to patients with specific illnesses in a manner that purportedly does not violate us federal law including us food and drug administration regulations by avoiding direct claims that the products cure any particular diseases mannatech ceo sam caster was interviewed for the show and told  that mannatech makes no specific health claims about its products i dont think dietary supplements treat cure mitigate anything it is not meant to substitute a doctors oversight but it plays an important role in the whole health equation company lossesedit mannatech announced in august  that company founder sam caster was stepping down as ceo of mannatech to be replaced by wayne badovinus as the new chief executive several corporate initiatives were undertaken but after  months on the job badovinus resigned in december  another member of the board resigned shortly after mannatechs chief science officer robert sinnott and mannatechs chief financial officer steve fenstermacher were named coceos fenstermacher later resigned publicity over the companys lawsuits began to damage the balance sheets and stock performance after profits of  million in  and  million in  mannatech reported a  million loss in  and a  million loss in  by midyear  one quarter of mannatechs sales were gone  losses were  million as the companys market capitalizations continued to fall sp indices dropped it from the sp  index stating they are no longer representative of the small cap market space recruiting efforts continued dropping in  widening company losses to  million illegal marketing by uk physicianedit as reported by the british medical journal mannatech distributor vivienne balonwu a uk general practitioner was found by the uk general medical council panel to have abused her power as a doctor after it was determined that she had illegally promoted and sold the companys glyconutrients to patients as a treatment for medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and strokerelated complications following patient complaints about her marketing of the products in  balonwu was dismissed by her employer harmoni a medical services company and the gmc panel imposed a month penalty period during which she was to avoid private or short term locum work and to complete a supervised personal development plan to tackle shortcomings in her practice ben carsonedit from  until early  neurosurgeon and conservative speaker ben carson made videos and spoke at company events promoting mannatech and its products after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer on august   carson claimed in an interview the following november that the surgery had successfully removed all cancerous tissue and that he was completely cured of the disease however in  in a speech at a mannatech event he credited the companys products with the disappearance of his cancer symptoms his most recent paid speech for the company was in  for which he was paid  his image appeared on the corporations website in  and in the same year he praised their glyconutrient supplements in a pbs special the missing link – the science of brain health sponsored by a group of mannatech distributors that was subsequently featured on the site carson delivered the keynote address at a mannatech distributor convention in  during which he said that the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at johns hopkins medicine    three years ago i had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh it requires  million to do an endowed chair and im proud to say that part of that  million came from mannatech in october  carsons campaign team said that there was no contribution from mannatech to johns hopkins and that his statement had been a legitimate mistake on his part confusion he had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time and he simply got things mixed up during the cnbc gop debate on october   carson was asked about his relationship with mannatech he replied thats easy to answer i didnt have any involvement with mannatech total propaganda i did a couple speeches for them i did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches it is absolutely absurd to say i had any kind of relation with them do i take the product yes i think it is a good product politifact rated carsons denial of any involvement as false pointing to his paid speeches for mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he gave favorable reviews to its products despite not being an official spokesman or sales associate when the cnbc moderator commented that carson was on mannatechs website he replied that he had not given his permission earlier he had said that he was unaware of the companys legal history on november   mannatech said on its website that for compliance with federal

scorpions however in january  the attorney general of texas investigated the product and found that the electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever the attorney general declared the device is a hoax and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine caster was ordered to stop selling the electracat and to reimburse the state  in investigative costs mannatechs inceptionedit

in the form of mannatech vitamins and products  mannatech inc was founded in the early s and is based out of coppell tx  the company is publicly traded on the nasdaq and is considered to be a midcap corp  mannatech inc now operates in a variety of countries around the globe including the united states germany japan canada and the uk  mannatech products include vitamins and supplements headed by the flagship product ambrotose  the full mannatech inc product line includes  nutritional supplements  topical creams and  weight loss inducing products  these are all sold through a multi level marketing system  although mannatech inc does extensive research on all its products and the board is headed by several renowned scientists there is controversy over the validity of their research trials  they have not conducted controlled clinical trials for all their products meaning that they have not been tested against a placebo  the only one that they did perform revealed no significant benefit of glyconutrients and their derivative products however many people testify to the healing powers of ambrotose claiming that its responsible for treating everything from eczema to lupus  again the validity of these claims has not been verified  despite the controversy mannatech inc does have some very noble goals and programs  including a program designed to help ailing children with nutritional deficiencies strengthen their immune systems on top of the questionable effectiveness of mannatech products there are a couple more warning signs  two of the founders have questionable pasts and mannatech inc is currently under investigation by the texas attorney general for alleged violation of the deceptive trade practices act  find out as much information as you can from the rep

mputation and died  months later from mets to bone and lung what a wasted shame  janice hwang   seoul koreaam on september nd  i have been taking these products for  months including advanced ambrotose osolean vitamins and glycoslim now i can see my health condition has been improved i have lost  pounds by taking protin shake i also look younger and never get sick as well as other people who commented here thanks to mannatech i was glad to find that there is a company who has a mission for helping kids with malnutrition i mean how many for profit companies can really help children continuously ron   europeam on july rd been using this product for  days after  days on the product a normal stool which i havent had for a long time also some scar tissue on my skin which has been there for a decade is fading and some small warts on my hand are shrinking they are there for a decade as well unfortunately no changes in my mental state still highly anxious and depressed brain fog i hope this clears up in time so no rating yet anna   new zealandam on may th  all i know was that i had pcos and also had a bleeding disorder which had me bleeding constantly for  months  months after taking twice the recommended amount this started to abate  months later there is no trace of it and my periods have gone completely back to normal i did nothing different except take this as i heard t had helped people in similar positions anonymous   location unknownam on may rd i gave my son advanced ambrotose when his kidneys were failing during highdose chemo during cancer in one day his kidney function began to improve and continued to improve during the chemo treatment and beyond that was  years ago he continues to take it daily lanette   yuba citypm on february th  i started taking mannetech  years ago all i can say is i love it i would recommend it to anyone looking for a health choice regiment i take plus ambrotose and ao i feel good everyday and notice i am never sick i am yrs old no health issues at this time becky   spokane waam on october rd  i take the probioticprebiotic supplement and have seen incredible improvement with my digestive tract quite honestly though other companies may have equally quality probiotics i just prefer mannatech because i can take the supplement as a powder with food most probiotics have to be taken on an empty stomach as for the other mannatech supplements quite honestly the price is prohibitive im also so tired of hearing my friend and her mother give me constant sales pitches about mannatech regurgitating what theyre taught to say that i am really sick of hearing about the company but i am very grateful for the prioboticprebiotic its about the same price as other probiotics and now i can eat chocolate and mildly spicy foods again so mannatech may be scamming in some areas i really dont know but the probiotics are the real deal terry   utaham on september th  who writes these reviews about mannatech it is overpriced garbage the placebo affect is in full force with people who claim these great results with this product most people are smart enough to not get trapped into paying money to this company and it over zealous associates i am in heath care profession and no one i know uses supplements from mannatech paula   oklahomapm on august st  have used mannatech products for at least  years got off of it one time and was sick every other month with sinus infections etc needless to say i got back on mannatech and have never looked back there is no need to took elsewhere for vitamins mannatech products are some kind of magic mickjayess   wa statepm on july th  at aaron in melbourne i am analytical and for my own analysis i say that the product gave me about  more energy in my opinion it could have been  heck maybe  i dunno but it was more than slight it was enough for me to really notice it and not getting sick i have to say maybe theres some other lifestyle change that reduced my number and longevity of sicknesses but i cant think of any other change in my life except i added the product so yep lets just say theres a chance of  error in my analysis it doesnt change the fact that i started using the product and all things being equal i felt  more energy and didnt get sick so try it for yourself and dont judge me by my own opinion anonymous   location unknownpm on november th  i have been taking manateck for five years and have had no illness at all the product works there is no doubt in my mind i am not a distributor just a very happy user i think the best way to judge the product is to try it for a while and you will see for yourself aaron   melbournepm on november nd science is a discipline which is evidence based so when you make a claim you should be backing it up with a study that supports it this is especially important when you are recommending an expensive product to someone desperately seeking hope that they can cure a condition taking advantage of vulnerable people is unethical second all the associates of mannatech clearly have a conflict of interest so you especially need to be backing up your claims and also people mickjayess seattle wa talking about the effectiveness of mannatech products by claiming they give him � more energy and  less illness� which is ridiculous how do u define illness and how can you claim you get specifically  more energy maybe you think saying you are �analytical in nature� before you say this actually backs it up before they put up an ad for �the  iron laws for successful forex trading� doesn�t exactly give a good impression of people trying to sell the stuff deborah andrews   savannah gaam on july th  i am have been a nurse for  years and i have never seen anything that can help someone to improve his health faster than glyconutrients the pharmaceutical community has attempted to gag mannatech associates so that the word cannot get out after all if people get healthy this will reduce their market shareprofits the results you achieve are in direct proportion to the severity of your conditions and the number of servings you take my health and my sons health has been dramatically improved by giving our bodies the glyconutrients necessary to have proper celltocell communication mickjayess   seattle waam on july th  i give the products  stars my parents take ao and sport supplements by mannatech i take both but only one capsule per day so i take ao one day and a sport the next day etc neither me or my parents are distributors compared to any other nutritional product on the market these rate at the top sure there are several other products that i rate excellent as well i simply choose only to take excellent products for my own health there is no cure all but the ao is wonderful it reduces the number of illnesses i get per year i am analytical in nature so in my opinion these give me about  more energy and  less illness and im only taking one capsule a day maria   los angelespm on may th  my bf was diagnosed with psoriasis and he has been taking maanotech stuff i have to say if not that stuff his outbreaks would have been worse i was taking stuff from pharmanex that stuff is yuck esp diet shakes  it is drained not filling just ewww their original formula was much much betterso i am thinking of trying mannotech robin   australiapm on april th  i have been an associate for  years and have found their products excellent i rated your review only fair as if you want to inform your readers you need to keep your reviews up to date the investigation by the texas ag filed in favor of mannatech which alone says huge positive things about the company linda   florence alam on june rd  i have religiously used ambrotose and plus since  when i was diagnosed with melanoma cancer because i am totally sold on it i would like to find someone to network with in the north alabama area jackie   las vegas nvpm on june th  we were told about mannatch by a friend who is a nurse she had gotten the products for her mother who had cancer and just raved about them we got the products for my mother who was diagnosed with stage  colon cancer i believe these products helped my mother tolerate her chemo treatments as well as help her appatite not to mention gave her the strength she needed to go through everything else she was only given  mos and survived for  yrs so i believe the products helped her jay   coloradopm on may th  i dont care at all about signing up anybody personally to mannatech cause i am in another mlm that i make more money in a lot faster what i can say is that i had the flu or colds  or  times a year before i started taking ambrotose and i have not had either one in the last  years i have used it i will continue to use and suggest people use it even though its expensive but cant sign anybody up cause most mlm companies dont like cross hosting its worth the high price anonymous   location unknownam on december th i take ambrotose after learning about the science its essential for us on a daily basis who would not want healthy cells the supplements can also be bought online without becoming an associate they give you that option great company im not in it to make money but to take the products and be able to tell others page        your name your location productservice rating choose   dreadful   poor   fair
