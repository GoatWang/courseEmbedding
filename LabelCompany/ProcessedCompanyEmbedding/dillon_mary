ground on its first location in manhattan and upping its online sales by more than  that’s all good news for ceo mary dillon but one of her biggest accomplishments isn’t as quantifiable dillon a veteran of mcdonald’s and gatorade summarizes the sorry state of ulta’s brand awareness when she took the helm in  with a friendly impression of her target customer “ultra what’s that” though sales were satisfactory a long association with tired strip malls and budget shopping had taken its toll dillon repositioned the brand putting new stores closer to urban centers she expects to open  more by  and investing in technology to deliver online orders more efficiently “we’re a yearold brand that i feel is just getting started” she says here are some of the strategies in her corporatemakeover playbookadvertisementgo beyond numbersthough dillon is an ulta shopper herself she still leans on tactics she honed at other companies when understanding the consumer didn’t come as easily she recalls her dogless days marketing for kibbles ’n bits members of her team go on shopalongs with customers asking them about what they like and how they use the products as they move through the store dillon couples that intel with data from ulta’s robust loyalty program ultamate rewards to complete her picture of the customer that understanding informs her decisions about how to market ulta’s more than  products for maximum impactoffer savings but make them personalbefore dillon’s arrival ulta was known for its abundance of discounts and coupons she has edged away from that bluntforce strategy instead incentivizing customers to join the loyalty program which allows her to tailor benefits to the shopper the theory thoughtful freebies some members recently received urban decay eyeshadow kits others a custom colormatched clinique foundation do more to deepen the customer’s emotional connection to the store than a generic  off mailer the strategy appears to be working the program’s  million

amplifierabout  times a year dillon makes trips to several stores around the country specifically to talk to associates listening for what bubbles up “i kind of collect these ‘ahas’ ” she says remembering the time she heard staff members mention how long it took to unpack the boxes that came from distribution centers she instructed the centers to reorganize the boxes aligning them with store layout the move enabled employees to spend more time with shoppers “that’s the kind of insight within the seams that’s important” dillon saysmeet customers where they aredillon believes building physical stores is critical to growth but she’s equally committed to improving ulta’s online shopping experience one of her early triumphs was investing in a pair of distribution centers that dramatically improved ulta’s ecommerce processing times “people want to buy online and they want to come into the store and try things” she says but she can also guide them toward new experiences last year ulta debuted glam lab a virtual tryon experience that allows users to upload a selfie and test products against their skin tonesadvertisementkeep culture at the centerulta generates 0 new jobs annually but dillon isn’t content to just create positions—they have to be fulfilling during a management meeting early in her tenure dillon noticed that no one seemed comfortable asking questions—and the ones that were voiced were often shut down today she encourages open feedback through a quantitative survey that goes out to the company’s  associates measuring how engaged they are how much they trust management and whether they believe their managers support their career development the results help dillon ensure ulta’s team members continue to uphold a culture of openness “at the end of the day especially in retail you’ve got humans serving humans” she says “and really the more engaged and happier the associates are the happier our guests are it’s not complicated”brushing upulta’s

by phil wahba photograph by rebecca greenfield for fortune september    am edt how ulta and mary dillon are winning the beauty battle can the fastgrowing cosmetics empire keep outmaneuvering the big drugstores and department stores that’s up to ceo dillon it didn’t take mary dillon long to realize she was in over her head six months into her tenure as ceo of ulta beauty dillon wanted to see what it felt like to work on the retailer’s front lines on the craziest shopping day of the year so on christmas eve in  during a family ski holiday she picked up a sixhour salesfloor shift at an ulta store near salt lake city inconspicuous in dresscodecompliant black shirt and pants and an ulta name tag dillon found herself besieged with questions from customers—about this facial mask or that haircoloring treatment—and overwhelmed by just how much she didn’t know about the  different products ulta sells eventually at the store manager’s suggestion she took a spot at the front of the store “the only thing i was qualified for was handing out shopping bags” she recalls that’s what she was doing when she had an epiphany another customer came up with a stack of coupons and asked dillon how to apply them given their mazes of terms and conditions dillon couldn’t decipher the discounts either but what really ignited her agita was what those coupons said about ulta’s marketing—its focus on the constant discounting that she calls a “race to the bottom”  am mary dillon commuting in suburban chicagophotograph by rebecca greenfield for fortune “it really hit me that day” dillon says “i didn’t want ulta to be thought of as the retailer for discounts i wanted ulta to be known as a beauty retailer” that may sound like a hair’sbreadth distinction to a layperson but it’s a big deal to dillon and ulta beauty ulta  ulta’s formula for selling beauty products—put them all under one roof and offer deals deals deals—turned the chain into a fastgrowing juggernaut a very rare success story in a gloomy decade for retail though it’s largely invisible in posh urban shopping districts the bolingbrook ill company now ranks as the country’s biggest specialized beauty retailer “they understand how american women buy beauty” says wendy liebmann ceo of wsl strategic retail since  ulta’s store count has tripled—it recently opened its 0th location—and sales have followed suit reaching  billion in  comparable sales growth which strips out results from newly closed or opened stores has also soared rising an astonishing  year over year in ulta’s most recent quarter head and shoulders above even the bestperforming chains most of which would be thrilled to hit  investors have salivated over the results ulta’s stock is up more than  since dillon became ceo and its market capitalization now exceeds  billion towering over retailers like macy’s m  kohl’s kss  and nordstrom jwn  whose sales are several times greater but all that growth has brought ulta to a critical juncture competition is getting hotter as rivals from drugstores to department stores to specialty chains like sephora chase the fastgrowing spending of beautyproduct buyers shareholders’ expectations are skyhigh—maybe unsustainably so and ulta remains unknown to a large swath of america click to enlarge to keep winning in this arena ulta is striving to redefine itself—making its image more about customer experience and convenience less about coupons that challenge and many others fall to dillon a yearold marketing veteran with an easygoing air—and a deep well of experience at huge brands ranging from gatorade to mcdonald’s mcd  howard schultz ceo of starbucks sbux  whose board dillon joined in january says she has the kind of savvy that will help ulta stand out in a crowded retail field “she understands the theater and the romance” that savvy has helped dillon keep the momen­tum going despite her lack of a beauty background the ulta ceo job is her first in the industry since she was  “ulta was not even on my radar” when she was approached about the gig in  she tells fortune at ulta’s headquarters  miles southwest of chicago but that she adds was a good thing it gave her a clean slate any speculation dillon might be a don’trocktheboat leader was quashed in  when she announced that ulta planned to expand to 0 stores by  en route to that goal she has already rewritten much of ulta’s playbook—the first steps in a transition she hopes will elevate the company from stripmall secret to household name to see the full  most powerful women list click here ulta owes its success so far to an allinclusive ethos it sells everything from massmarket brands to highend cosmetics to professional haircare products all in a format that lets customers try before they buy ulta offers salon services too so in one trip you theoretically could get your hair done and get a facial and then buy a curling iron and moisturizer to maintain the look at home 0 am dillon at a starbucks in naperville ill she recently joined the company’s boardphotograph by rebecca greenfield for fortune the chain was the brainchild of a group of former executives at osco a midwestern regional drugstore whose insight was that busy women didn’t want to go to a drugstore then a mall then a salon to shop for beauty products the idea recalls terry hanson an ulta cofounder was “to save women time” that may sound obvious today but it wasn’t the norm in  when ulta opened its first five stores nor was it the founders’ only prescient idea in  ulta introduced a shopperrewards program a relatively new concept in retail at the time the program now called ultamate is one of the nation’s biggest loyalty programs with  million members—and members account for an astounding  of its sales ulta opened most of its early locations in strip malls that was initially a function of how little rent it could afford but it sped up the chain’s expansion the stripmall locations became an even greater asset after the great recession as traffic at conventional malls dropped off along the way ulta developed a reputation as an oasis for women where shopping is a kind of playtime for the suburban mom “it’s not a chore” is how dillon describes an ulta break stores are relatively roomy—typically 0 square feet with about 0 of that taken up by salon stations—and ulta says threequarters of customers spend at least  minutes

motivate them” says margaret stender a colleague and mentor at quaker oats after becoming head of marketing for petfood brand ­kibbles ’n bits dillon who didn’t own pets started the good doggie club—meeting regularly with dog parents so she could learn what they loved hated and needed in 00 when she took over gatorade’s marketing dillon signed up to run the chicago marathon to better

looking at the newspaper and was like ‘you just qualified for the boston marathon’ ” for family reasons dillon wanted to keep her career rooted in chicago she and her husband terry have four grown children and terry a biochemist was a stayathome parent in 0 she landed with one of the city’s biggest corporate names becoming global chief marketing officer at mcdonald’s mcdonald’s chairman emeritus andy mckenna a mentor and fixture of chicago’s business community says dillon mixed datadriven rigor with creativity among her innovations was a “global moms panel” that helped her vet the fastfood chain’s campaigns because of mcdonald’s structure however dillon didn’t have responsibility over a profitandloss line and she didn’t have the handson authority she craved today she describes the job as feeding her “a big dose of humility” but mckenna recalls her having big ambitions saying “she wanted to be a ceo”  pm dillon holding a qa with ulta “beauty associates”photograph by rebecca

general were struggling and in three years as ceo dillon was unable to move the company’s stock she also made an early misstep she decided the carrier wouldn’t offer apple’s iphone saying it was too pricey she reversed herself  months later amid falling customer counts dillon calls her initial rejection “the right decision at the time” still the job gave dillon even more executive expertise

powerful women special edition on a tour of a store in naperville ill dillon is a warm whirlwind hugging store managers and greeting stylists by name she makes store visits around the country at least once a month but her dropins are more frequent here just a few miles from ulta’s headquarters her visits often include mini focus groups with staff during which dillon asks for the brutally frank feedback she didn’t feel entitled to give as a teenage drugstore clerk dillon’s own tastes in beauty products could be called midwestern put together—stylish but not showy last year on an ulta trip she bought a pair of ardell false eyelashes—only to immediately remove them satisfied that “i can do this if i need to” on store visits she adopts a customer’s mindset she’s in the market for a good red lipstick and considers herself a hairproduct aficionado boasting that she’s “great at braids” and does a mean updo but she’s also quick to boast about improvements just inside the store sits a stack of catalogs for ultamate members these used to be glorified couponclipper books with dull fonts and drab design now it looks like something a shopper might actually want to read “it’s not just price but about product and teaching the customers about beauty” dillon says “dillon understands the theater and the romance that are necessary in all aspects of the customer experience” though the company was soaring when she became ceo on july   dillon saw that there were cracks in ulta’s mirror market research at the time showed a  overlap between ulta’s offerings and amazon’s beauty assortment that meant ulta was “amazonable” and needed to compete on much more than price the board gave dillon a mandate to elevate ulta’s presentation marketing and product lines and generally catch up with the times on the ecommerce front those catalogs represent just one tiny brushstroke in the makeover ulta’s inhouse brands which account for only about  of sales are getting an upgrade dillon has overhauled the ultamate loyalty program introducing new perks like one that offers some items exclusively to members the more ultamate shoppers ulta has the better its analytics for deciding on new products and new store locations and ulta has just launched its firstever store credit card—yet another way to gather better shopper data dillon has also strengthened ulta’s technical backbone in  she set a longterm goal for ecommerce to double from  of ulta’s sales to 0 since then it has grown at a searing pace of about  a year dillon’s team has opened two new distribution centers to support

needsphotograph by rebecca greenfield for fortune brands like these used to shun ulta because of its downmarket locations that began to change in the 00s and now in a virtuous circle that dillon wants to perpetuate ulta’s success is giving it more clout with developers in finding prime locations for new stores—helping her expand store count while gussying up the chain’s overall image “over time our real estate is getting better not worse” says ulta’s chief financial officer scott settersten you’re likely to find older ulta stores next to say a cent store or a convenience store but ulta’s preferred neighbors are retailers like tj maxx and target—because of the middleclass shoppers they attract—and now some stores can be found next to a trader joe’s or whole foods wfm  regardless of the store address ulta’s reliable growth has contrasted favorably with the ongoing departmentstore meltdowns making it easier to lure luxury brands “there is nothing wrong with strip malls if ulta has a nice presentation traffic training and experience” says fabrizio freda ceo of estée lauder in other words downmarket stigma be damned read more how ulta outruns bigger retailers in the beautyproducts

beauty than any other retail channel” says kantar retail director brian owens “they want to convert shoppers who may have gotten ideas at sephora or ulta” stealing the patronage of customers looking to simply restock familiar brands for now investment analysts seem to think ulta can keep its edge “the burden is on ulta” to keep its product line fresh says oliver chen a retail analyst with cowen  co but thanks to “the solid management team the very good concept and the scale the momentum bodes well” how ulta’s growth is exceeding sales expectations of course no company’s momentum is infinite last year ulta’s stock rose  and the board rewarded dillon with a compensation package of  million that made her the sixthbestpaid us woman ceo in  ahead of the likes of mondelez international’s irene rosenfeld and hp’s meg whitman according to the associated press but numbers like that won’t be easy to replicate dillon has begun readying wall street for a future in which ulta posts comparable sales growth of  to  a year that’s a figure that most retailers can only dream of attaining still for ulta that will represent a slowdown resulting from the law of big numbers potential cannibalization from its new stores and yes stiffer competition “we’re doing well” dillon tells staff during her naperville store visit “so now is the perfect time to ask ‘what are we doing right’ ” that’s not the only relevant question however ulta has to fight the temptation to go into autopilot mode and coast on what works “we are never complacent” dillon tells fortune “my job is to make us

to 0 percent of total sales by  up from  percent nowdillon a chicago native said the first challenge she confronted at ulta after former ceo chuck rubin left to helm artsandcrafts chain michaels was the need to think longterm in a constantly changing industryamazon has done something for all of retail which is resetting the customer expectations about how quickly and easily you can get things said dillon who served as global chief marketing officer at mcdonalds before taking on cellphones and then cosmeticsyet we have an experience here in the store that is very relevant and always will be for ultaher first move she said was to craft a senior leadership team that could see the business from the customers perspective 0 years in the future with competition increasingly stiff particularly

made its bricksandmortar debut at ulta isa point of pride for dillon who counts introducing new brands as a strategic imperative other recent ulta debuts include cindy crawfords skin care line meaningful beautyone thing i love about the beauty industry is that there are so many entrepreneurs so much creativity such a fun pipeline of products dillon saidcontinuing her walk dillon stopped in front of a skin care station where customers can get power peels 0 microdermabrasion treatments  or minute quickfix facials  from skin therapists trained by dermalogicathis is an area that really i think were going to get more famous for she saiddillon said many people dont know that ulta operates instore salons where customers can get haircuts and color nail services skin treatments and false eyelash applications a growing numbers of stores also have benefit brow bars for eyebrow upkeepsalons constitute a small part of ultas sales — most business comes from its  million loyalty members and

get her hair done therei have a salon i go to she saidleopold said she stops into ulta almost weekly during her sunday errands to peruse the nail polish aislesand appreciates that stores receive hardtoget products quicklybut she doesnt view ulta as a place to discover new brands which she prefers to do on ecommerce sites that seem to pop up weeklythe excitement i get when i go to ulta is not necessarily that i havent heard of this brand but rather that i have leopold saidshe views ulta differently from rival sephora which sells premium brands the french company also has been growing strongly though in the us it remains a smaller playerlvmh which owns sephora does not report the beauty retailers sales individually but analysts at new yorkbased investment research firm sanford c bernstein forecast  percent annualsales growth over the next few yearswith black glossy fixtures and thumping music sephora exudes a younger nightclub vibe that can feel overstimulating leopold said to avoid that scene and because she likes the promotion codes and mailed samples she prefers to shop sephora onlineat ulta where the lights are bright the music quiet and the aisles wide leopold prefers to shop in person at her leisure ulta stores tend to be in power centers or strip malls to give customers driveup convenienceulta for me still has the suburban mom demographic leopold saiddillon talks often about marketing to the beauty enthusiast but said the profile of her target audience is more psychographic than demographic spanning all ages incomes and geographiesthe common thread is that they love beauty they take care of their skin they like to try new trends and learn whats trending dillon said the average transaction at ulta is about 0still karen grant global beauty
