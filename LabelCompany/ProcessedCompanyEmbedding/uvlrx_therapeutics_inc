than some of our more common pharmaceutical agents  the delivery of light has assumed many forms thermal light for tissue ablation transdermal light for photobiomodulation of superficial subdermal tissue extracorporeal light for blood irradiation each delivery method serves a very specific function in medicine and has a strong clinical foundation  at the same time each delivery method has welldefined therapeutic limitations  for instance extracorporeal light irradiation requires the removal of blood from the body for therapeutic light exposure before being returned to the body

flexible fiber optic to our patentpending uvlrx dry light adapter™ dla – an accessory that integrates into a standard gauge x ″ intravascular catheter and delivers light directly within the blood

dose of light maximizing the health benefitsan additional feature of the uvlrx treatment system™ is the application of multiple wavelengths concurrently  most lightbased treatments deliver a single wavelength which in turn limits their therapeutic potential  a disease or condition has a complex pathophysiology involving numerous biochemical pathways  therefore suppression or activation of a single pathway may provide a fleeting clinical response as it fails to address the other involved pathways an example of this is the use of extracorporeal ultraviolet blood irradiation for the treatment of a bloodborne pathogen uv light is a powerful antimicrobial agent however uv light alone would not enhance the immune system’s response or assuage the stress and damage caused by the
