amazon in ecommerce and integrate online and offline offerings is entering some new fronts and generating sometimes surprising results as the company prepares to launch the latest in a spate of new initiatives  goodies a subscription mailordersampling program goodies set to roll out within about a month will initially focus on artisan and other food products but could expand to other product categories said neil ashe ceo of global ecommerce for walmart in a press briefing in rogers ark the briefing was part of the retailers shareholders week events prior to fridays annual shareholder meeting the monthly subscription price has yet to be determined he said adding think of it as cheap initially walmartcom will choose the products to include in the box then monitor how popular they are based on reorder activity mr ashe likened goodies to the birchbox program for cosmetics and if it gains traction he said marketers may be willing to pay to include their products mr ashe who took the top walmart ecommerce job in january after running cbs interactive noted that he didnt have much retail experience coming in but joked that he had worked in his fathers small retail store in knoxville tenn when he was growing up and in one of his first public appearances since taking the highprofile ecommerce role mr ashe laid out his vision for walmart which includes making considerable use of having the worlds biggest combination of online and offline retail assets one way walmartcom is doing that is by applying the social analytics developed by its walmartlabs ecommerce and mobile rd unit mr ashe said that includes mining every tweet it can find from the brands  millionplus facebook fans that analysis earlier this year helped identify a cakepop maker as a popular item among shoppers we were able to get those into stores immediately and they were big sellers as a result mr ashe said we probably never would have found that product without the twitter feed in many ways the ethos of walmart and ethos of the internet are exactly the same mr ashe said including the focus on the lowest possible price when i looked at the company from the outside i couldnt think of a company that was better positioned to be successful in the transition to the internet or ecommerce than walmart walmart is seeing strong results from the most recent upgrade of its iphone app including an instore gps feature that lets people find products in stores app downloads have tripled since the latest upgrade and  to  of users are using the instore gps feature said gibu thomas senior vpmobile and digital of walmart only available on the iphone now the gps feature should be available on android and other devices within weeks mr thomas said theres probably no way to overstate the importance of mobile over the next  years in ecommerce mr ashe said and we intend to play to win in mobile but much of that victory will come from efforts that tie mobile to the store such as instore gps a recently launched pay with cash program mr ashe said is opening walmartcom to a whole segment of the population that s being ignored for no apparent reason the product is still shipped to homes though customers pay with cash at walmart stores one of the more interesting things about this that we didnt expect is that only  of the people actually pay with cash mr ashe said the other  are simply people uncomfortable giving their creditcard numbers out over the internet so the customer base drawn by the program is a combination of the unbanked without credit cards or checking accounts and those afraid of identity theft said joel anderson president of walmartcom us walmartcom actually identified the need for the program he said when it tested walmartcom stores in strip centers in california last year and discovered many people were buying moneypak or other cash cards in stores and then using the computers in the stores to order products to ship home mr anderson said what hasnt moved online yet are the true grocery and consumables categories mr ashe said adding it may never get all the way there but he said the walmarttogo homedelivery service the company is testing may be a way to help that happen in this article digitalnews most popular become a member register now renew membership benefits datacenter site by area  walmart and jdcom announce strategic alliance to serve

the startup spirit to compete against amazon will it be enough illustration by owen gildersleeve by farhad manjoolong readjeremy king was ignoring the largest retailer in the world for a month he’d been getting calls from a walmart recruiter king was used to being wooed since he was well known in silicon valley as an engineer who built key parts of ebay’s infrastructure the calls kept coming finally he picked up the phone and let walmart know exactly what it would take to get him to interview “i was like ‘why don’t you get the ceo on the phone–let him talk to me and then maybe i’ll come in” recalls king who didn’t even know who the ceo of walmart was “i was being cocky the ceo of the world’s largest retailer wasn’t going to meet with me just so i’d do an interview”advertisementthe next thing king knew walmart arranged for him to join a videoconference with ceo mike duke “it was the strangest thing” king says “mike’s office in bentonville is the original one that sam walton had complete with s wood paneling i was looking at this video thinking where is this place”over the next  minutes though duke made what king calls an irresistible pitch after years of seeing his company lag online duke swore that digital was now a priority for walmart duke had restructured the company placing ecommerce on equal footing with walmart’s other much larger divisions he had made serious investments in hightech talent acquiring several startups one a person social media firm called kosmix with expertise in search and analytics was the impetus for walmart rechristening its valley operations “walmartlabs” duke was looking for people who would revive the company’s sites and services and energize its entire culture he hoped to turn a company famous for rigid coldly effective business processes into one that’s flexible experimental and entrepreneurial in other words duke wanted to inject a bit of silicon valley into bentonville arkansas in the summer of  king signed up as cto of walmartcom “we’ve hired hundreds of incredibly talented people in silicon valley and around the world” says duke of his aggressive moves “we are playing to win”“we are uniquely positioned to give customers anytime anywhere access by combining the smartphone online and the physical stores” says walmart ceo mike dukewalmartlabs is now housed in a boxy office tower in san bruno california a few miles south of san francisco in just over a year it has helped walmartcom revamp its search engine presciently identified the potential of the now redhot “social gifting” market where companies use social media cues to suggest presents and this fall launched a test that offers sameday shipping to customersthis last move is a clear signal of walmart’s serious intent to compete in digital ecommerce–and blunt the looming threat of amazon which has its own sameday shipping experiments having marginalized barnes  noble and best buy jeff bezos has his eyes on a bigger target amazon has been moving aggressively to sell walmart staples such as diapers soap pet food and cereal even letting customers subscribe for items they want to receive regularly walmart is the world’s biggest grocer and a central part of its strategy is that the millions of folks who visit its stores weekly to buy food will purchase a lot of other stuff that’s a key reason walmart’s  revenue of  billion dwarfed amazon’s  sales of  billionin ecommerce however walmart is a distant challenger the company has never broken out its internet revenue though in  the analyst internet retailer estimated it to be  billion in october walmart projected that global ecommerce would be  billion in the year ahead meanwhile amazon has been on a tear with sales rocketing toward  billion annually in  analysts i spoke to believe amazon has eaten into walmart’s sales of books music dvds electronics and even toys “when people started to say that amazon was going to be the walmart of ecommerce” notes scot wingo ceo of channeladvisor an ecommerce technology and consulting firm “that’s when we started to see more signs of life from walmart”it would be a radical oversimplification to chalk up walmart’s digital revival solely to a hungry competitor and walmart execs often insist perhaps a bit too strenuously that they are not fixated on amazon no walmart needs to get digital because that’s where its customers are headed soon everyone’s phone will be smart enough for easy shopping with internetenabled tablets selling for well under  lowerincome families are already turning into online customers “the way our customers shop in an increasingly interconnected world is changing” duke saysadvertisement“i’m not going to be chicken little and tell you the company is going to go away if we don’t get the internet and mobile right” adds neil ashe the company’s topranking ecommerce executive “we have an obligation to the mission to get this thing right because the customer expects it of us” like the best internet companies walmart obsesses about its customers more than its competitionin  walmart celebrated its th birthday in its first  years walmart became the world’s biggest general merchandise retailer but sam walton wanted to be a grocer as well “a lot of people said that was crazy” says joel anderson the ceo of walmartcom us who joined the company in  “twentyfive years ago we couldn’t even spell grocery people thought we’d never figure it out” walmart’s lessons for  follow your customers as technology goes mainstream walmart embraces the tools its customers are using every day turn your perceived weakness into a strength walmart stores can deliver a better shopping experience and faster delivery get small then get out of the way walmartlabs is organized into small teams that pursue product ideas like a startup experiment then experiment again walmartlabs pursues ideas that can change the company’s image–as well as boost revenue bet for the long term walmart sees its digital transformation as a year mission rather than a quick fix read more “lessons for ”  anderson says the next  years are about becoming a digital company “in the first few years were we tinkering and experimenting and not moving there’s some truth to that but look at our history when walmart leans into something it’s like a tidal wave”in april  walmart bought kosmix for a reported  million kosmix’s expertise lay in simplifying the sprawl of the web for users its algorithms were novel because they tried to understand what a user wanted rather than just match her query text for example if a user searched for “presidential election” google would return pages that contain variations on that term kosmix could find pages that were part of that topic even if the pages didn’t contain the specific phrase it then sorted them into categories such as candidate biographies news stories and polling data only in the past year have google and microsoft’s bing added kosmixlike topic pages to their search results but kosmix’s founders venky harinarayan and anand rajaraman hit upon the idea way back in walmart wanted to apply kosmix’s artificial intelligence to commerce but it also wanted the real brains behind the tech harinarayan  and rajaraman  both born and raised in india and graduates of the prestigious iit madras university have been inseparable friends since they met as phd students at stanford in the s both skinny and short they have more than a passing physical resemblance and they operate as a united pair in the valley which loves its duos such as bill and dave jobs and woz ev and biz they’re known as venky and anandthe pair first tackled the problem of organizing the web in  when they founded jungleecom in  jeff bezos acquired the company for  million in stock he realized that junglee’s technology would help its customers compare prices with other online stores a bold move toward transparency that turned out to further solidify the company’s hold on those customers rajaraman became amazon’s director of technology while harinarayan was charged with creating amazon’s marketplace where any merchant could sell its wares on amazon’s site “i’d meet with jeff for a couple hours every week” says harinarayan “what we came up with in  was pretty much what amazon has executed on since then” analysts estimate  of the goods sold on amazon are via marketplaceadvertisementthe duo left amazon in  and after a fouryear stint as venture capitalists founded kosmix the company had a unique ability to find meaningful information in the cacophony of the web an application it built called tweetbeat became one of the hottest ways to explore twitter during the  soccer world cup because it made it easy to discover who was talking about your favorite team or even individual players that’s part of what lured walmart execs–they salivated at the idea of bringing this kind of intelligence to shopping people are always offering clues about products on social media–writing reviews liking brands checking into stores announcing the products they want to buyand what lured harinarayan and rajaraman besides the money they saw an opportunity to do something more interesting than merely replicate their work at amazon for its rival in a delicious irony bezos profited from the walmart deal–he was an early investor in kosmix “what has changed since amazon became big” rajaraman asks rhetorically “you can connect the social experience the instore experience and the online experience nobody could do that”when the kosmix team landed at walmart in the summer of  they found a mess “the only thing silicon valley about walmart was that we had an office in silicon valley” says gibu thomas the senior vp who heads up walmart’s mobile tech team and was one of the first executives to approach kosmix about a deal “it was run like a traditional it organization” he says explaining that walmart used outsourced offtheshelf systems to power key parts of its site worse walmart’s  worldwide subsidiaries used incompatible technologies the sites did not connect seamlessly with the stores or with walmart’s legendary supply chainwalmartcom’s search engine epitomized its failure “executives at walmart–at the board level–were running searches and saying ‘this is embarrassing” says sri subramaniam the walmartlabs exec who ran the rebuilding effort if you used walmartcom’s old search engine to check out “smartphones” you’d get links to a couple of cellphone chargers not the iphone a “cotton socks” query returned results for cotton candy and balls of yarnthe kosmix team so deeply ensconced in the ways of silicon valley worried that cultural differences would hamper their efforts to turn the site around “my first reaction was wow this is going to be interesting” says chris bolte who works on walmart’s search marketing systems but those fears proved unfounded more than a halfdozen people on both sides of the acquisition say that kosmix’s integration into walmart was amazingly smooth “i think part of it was that walmart knew that they needed us that this was a turnaround situation” subramaniam saystheir first job was to create a new search engine it took just  months with just a dozen or so engineers walmart will not discuss specific sales figures but execs report that the improved search tools have increased the number of people who are converted from visitors to buyers on walmartcom by as much as  if you search for cotton socks now you’ll actually find themadvertisementwhen harinarayan and rajaraman transformed kosmix into walmartlabs they put roughly half the staff on such boring but crucial tasks they deployed the rest as true lab workers with the freedom to experiment in small teams on farflung new ideas “we organize these teams as mini startups with six to eight people” says harinarayan who learned from bezos’s organizational innovation of socalled twopizza teams “one person acts as ceo and they have a clear business goal we step out of the way and let these guys run it”one of the first projects born from this approach was shopycat a giftrecommendation app that walmartcom launched on facebook before the  holidays shopycat scans your friends’ profiles to identify interesting gift ideas from their stream of likes comments and status updates discerning if the “ted” your pal is raving about is the geeky ideas festival or the seth macfarlane stoner comedy shopycat then seeks out an appropriate gift for such a stonerthinker from walmart’s product database walmart says shopycat led to an increase in purchases on the site though it won’t say by how much for the  holidays the team built shopycat into a section of walmartcom called walmart gifts customers will log in with their facebook or twitter account to get personalized recommendations“we’re going to find ways to live at the edge” says walmart ecommerce chief neil ashe “every three or six months you’ll see something come out from us that will make you say ‘wow” another clever retail application of walmartlabs’s core technology has been to use spikes in social network chatter to predict demand for outoftheordinary products last year the team correctly anticipated heightened customer interest in cakepop makers based on social media conversations on facebook and twitter a few months later it noticed growing interest in electric juicers tied in part to the popularity of the juicecrazy documentary fat sick and nearly dead the team sends the data to walmart’s buyers who right now are only using it to confirm its other research but as these signals become stronger execs say it will play a larger role in purchasing decisionswalmartlabs has also created projects that just get customers to think differently about walmart and ecommerce including get on the shelf an online contest for people to submit their own inventions to go on sale at walmart get on the shelf was a social marketing blockbuster garnering more than  submissions over  million votes and news hits in small towns across america then there’s goodies a subscription service in which walmart customers pay seven dollars a month for home delivery of a gourmet food box–creating a discerning test market for the grocer in the processby themselves none of these projects will singlehandedly boost walmart’s ecommerce business taken together though they showcase a new dynamism at the retailing giant “we’re going to find ways to live at the edge” says walmart ecommerce exec ashe “every three or six months you’ll see something come out from us that will make you say ‘wow’ “the next step says harinarayan is about “scaling up labs” but he and rajaraman won’t be part of it in june harinarayan and rajaraman announced that they were leaving walmartlabs to many outsiders the abruptness of the founders’ departure seemed troubling it had been only a year since the acquisition and they hadn’t completed the “earnout” phase meaning they wouldn’t receive their full share from the sale was their departure a sign that dynamic tech entrepreneurs felt smothered by walmart’s corporate culture or was it that walmart could no longer tolerate leaving these handsoff leaders in chargeadvertisementharinarayan and rajaraman dismiss the speculation they say they had spent eight years on the startup and they were simply ready for time off one friday not long after the announcement i meet harinarayan at a coffee shop across the street from kosmix’s first office in downtown mountain view he’s the picture of a relaxed man after chatting about walmart and amazon for an hour he told me he was free to keep talking as he didn’t have anything else to do that day and he is quite sanguine about walking away from the money “given the fortune that anand and i have had in our careers if you’re doing anything just for money at this point it’s going to be the wrong thing to do”jeremy king took over as the head of walmartlabs and to get a sense of where he will bring the skunk works i visit the gleaming new walmart store off the almaden expressway in san jose where jonathan sherman a walmartlabs product manager gives me a peek into the digital dimension being woven into this temple of american retailthat future begins like everything else with a smartphone app walmart imagines that as you go through an average day you’ll remember things you need–milk bread a new tennis racquet a toy truck for your nephew’s birthday–and tell the voiceenabled walmart app the app will list each item’s location inside your local walmart and include product info eventually it will also learn your preferences and offer recommendations and once you’re actually in the store you’ll be able to summon an associate to help you walmart’s current iphone app has only a few of these features the voicelist system works very well and depending on which store you’re in and what you’re looking for the app can sometimes locate your productat the moment though it won’t show you extensive product info for all items and it won’t summon store help the company has begun to test mobile checkout in select stores as part of it walmart presents customers with a running tally of their total bill as they shop the first explicit nod in my journey through walmartlabs to the fact that millions of walmart shoppers are on tight budgetsthis effort to reinvent the instore shopping experience is an argument that walmart’s physical stores are a great asset not a liability “we are uniquely positioned to give customers anytime anywhere access to walmart by combining the smartphone online and the physical stores” duke says “ultimately that will give us an edge over any competitor” when i ask walmart executives about amazon’s moves to offer more customers nextday and sameday shipping many were amused “it’s fun to see them trying to be us” says walmartcom ceo anderson “we have more than  forwarddeployed fulfillment centers and we’re already doing shipments from some of them some people call them stores”“if you think about the last  years of retail how people shop in a store has not changed” thomas says “the question we’re asking is how do you bring to a store the capabilities that have made ecommerce successful with  million customers a week if you can increase the average basket size by a dollar–that’s billions of dollars every year” in fact it’s more than  billion–more than its projected annual ecommerce revenue this yearadvertisementif walmart fails in its digital transformation it won’t be for lack of resources or possibilities ninetysix percent of americans live within  miles of a walmart no one has as much money no one has a better supply chain no one has such a close connection with so many customers walmart execs know this “we’ll spend more on capital expenditures this year than amazon has spent in its entire history” ashe tells me hyperbolicallythat size however is also walmart’s greatest enemy walmartlabs’s twopizza teams can come up with a thousand innovative ways to improve shopping online and off but none matter if the company’s execution is slow and bureaucratic and the fact is that implementing these ideas will always be complex every change to how items are delivered or how customers navigate stores or how applications work with the company’s existing it structure is a maneuver that requires the coordination of thousands of moving partsbut walmart can succeed online without becoming the amazon of the web the phrase i hear most often from walmart people is that the only way the company will win online is “by being walmart” and they’re right walmart doesn’t need to be something radically different the company that mastered it in the service of unbeatable prices must now master web technology it doesn’t need to chase amazon so much as it needs to identify how a digital walmart can be as much a part of its customers’ lives as the stores are todayand it has to think long term it may take a decade or more for walmart to be a successful digital retailer “somebody at one of the board meetings asked me ‘neil how long is this going to take and how much is it going to cost” ashe recalls “and i said ‘it’s going to take the rest of our careers and it’s going to cost whatever it costs because this isn’t a project this is the company”advertisementrelated

walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology it has software to watch social media like pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert
