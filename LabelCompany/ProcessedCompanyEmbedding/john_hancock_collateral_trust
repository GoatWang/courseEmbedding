other trustee generally the board has designated a number of standing committees as further described below each of which has a chairperson the board also may designate working groups or ad hoc committees as it deems appropriate    table of contents the board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the board to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees or working groups of trustees and the full board in a manner that enhances effective oversight the board considers leadership by an independent trustee as chairperson to be integral to promoting effective independent oversight of the funds operations and meaningful representation of the shareholders interests given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the funds the board also believes that having a supermajority of independent trustees is appropriate and in the best interest of the funds shareholders nevertheless the board also believes that having interested persons serve on the board brings corporate and financial viewpoints that are in the boards view helpful elements in its decisionmaking process in addition the board believes that messrs boyle bromley and thomson as current or former senior executives of mfc the parent company of the advisor and of other affiliates of

secretary of the relevant fund at  congress street th floor boston massachusetts  any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of rule a under the exchange act in order to be considered by the committee in evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder the committee in addition to the criteria discussed below may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders the committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering trustee candidates including but not limited to the following criteria i the nominees reputation for integrity honesty and adherence to high ethical standards and such other personal characteristics as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others ii the nominees business professional academic financial accounting or other experience and qualifications which demonstrate that he or she will make a valuable contribution as trustee iii a commitment to understand the funds and the responsibilities of a trustee of an investment company iv a commitment to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the board and its committees v the ability to understand potential conflicts of interest involving management of the funds and to act in the interests of all shareholders vi the absence of a real or apparent conflict of interest that would impair the nominees ability to represent the interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of an independent trustee and vii experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities the committee may determine that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the committee finds that the criteria satisfied by the candidate    table of contents and the candidates other qualifications demonstrate the appropriate level of fitness to serve this committee will strive to achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences in respect of industries

shareholders to serve as independent trustees the committee may act upon such recommendations only if there is a vacancy on the board or the committee determines that the selection of a new or additional independent trustee is in the best interests of a fund while the committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the board of independent trustee candidates the

account a wide variety of factors in considering trustee candidates including but not limited to the criteria set forth below the committee may determine that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the committee finds that the criteria satisfied by the candidate and the candidates other qualifications demonstrate the appropriate level of fitness to serve general criteria  nominees should have a reputation for integrity honesty and adherence to high ethical standards and such other personal characteristics as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others  nominees should have business professional academic financial accounting or other experience and qualifications which demonstrate that they will make a valuable contribution as trustees  nominees should have a commitment to understand the funds and the responsibilities of a trusteedirector of an investment company and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the board and its committees  nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the funds including shareholders and the investment adviser and to act in the interests of all shareholders  nominees should not have nor appear to have a conflict of interest that would impair their ability to represent the interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a trustee  nominees should have experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities it is the intent of the committee that at least one independent trustee be an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in item  of form ncsr application of criteria to current trustees the renomination of current trustees should not be viewed as automatic but should be based on continuing qualification under the criteria set forth above based on among other things the current trustees contribution to the board and any committee on which he or she serves review of nominations  the committee believes that it is in the best interests of each trust and its shareholders to obtain highlyqualified candidates to serve as members of the board  in nominating candidates who would be independent trustees the committee believes that no particular qualities or skills nor any specific minimum qualifications or disqualifications are controlling or paramount the committee shall take into consideration any such factors as it deems appropriate these factors may include but are not limited to the persons character integrity judgment skill diversity and experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose complexity and size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight the interplay of the candidates experience with the experience of other board members and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the board and any committees thereof other factors that the committee may take into consideration include a persons availability and commitment to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities whether or not the person has or had any relationships that might impair or appear to impair his or her independence such as any business financial or family relationships with fund management the investment adviser andor any subadviser of the funds as applicable fund service providers or their affiliates or with fund shareholders the committee will strive to achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences in respect of industries professions and other experiences and that is diversified as to gender and race  while the committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the board of independent trustee candidates the committee may consider nominees recommended by any source including shareholders management legal counsel and board members as it deems appropriate the committee may retain a professional search firm or a consultant to assist the committee in a search for a qualified candidate any recommendations from shareholders shall be directed to the secretary of the relevant trust at such address as is set forth in the trusts disclosure documents recommendations from management may be submitted to the committee chair all recommendations shall include all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of board members and as specified in the relevant trusts bylaws and must be accompanied by a written consent of the proposed candidate to stand for election if nominated for the board and to serve if elected by shareholders  any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of rule a under the securities exchange act of  in order to be considered by the committee in evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder the committee in addition to the criteria discussed above may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders if the board determines to include a shareholders candidate among the slate of its designated nominees the candidates name will be placed on the trusts proxy card if the board determines not to include such candidate among its designated nominees and the shareholder has satisfied the requirements of rule a the shareholders candidate will be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who originally nominated the candidate in that case the candidate will not be named on the proxy card distributed with the trusts proxy statement  as long as a current independent trustee continues in the opinion of the committee to satisfy the criteria listed above the committee generally would favor the renomination of a current trustee rather than a new candidate consequently while the committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as trustees the committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the board or the committee determines that the selection of a new or additional trustee is in the best interests of the relevant trust in the event that a vacancy arises or a change in board    table of contents membership is determined to be advisable the committee will in addition to any shareholder recommendations consider candidates identified by other means as discussed in this annex a  with respect to candidates for independent trustee a biography of each candidate shall be acquired and shall be reviewed by counsel to the independent trustees and counsel to the trust to determine the candidates eligibility to serve as an independent trustee  the committee may from time to time establish specific requirements andor additional factors to be considered for independent trustee candidates as it deems necessary or appropriate  after its consideration of relevant factors the committee shall present its recommendations to the full board for its consideration    table of
