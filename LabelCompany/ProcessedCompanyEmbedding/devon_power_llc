document sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble issued june   before commissioners pat wood iii chairman nora mead brownell and joseph t kelliher i introduction  on march   iso new england inc isone submitted a filing in compliance with the commissions directive in devon power llc et al that a locational installed capacity licap market or deliverability requirements be implemented in new england by june   installed capacity icap obligations are intended to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to supply system peak load under all contingencies taking into account events such as generator outages in this order the commission establishes hearing procedures regarding isones filing and delays the implementation of a licap market until the conclusion of those proceedings the commission will direct the presiding judge to issue an initial decision by june   the commission will defer implementation of the licap proposal as modified in this order until january   the commission believes that deferring implementation until then will not only allow for a comprehensive examination of the issues at hearing but will also allow for completion of needed infrastructure upgrades in new englands constrained areas consistent with the recent policy on reliability compensation issues the commissions goal in establishing these hearing procedures is to arrive at a final licap market design that will appropriately compensate generators needed for reliability and attract and retain necessary infrastructure to assure longterm reliability along with deferring the implementation date the commission directs isone to file reports updating progress made in the siting permitting and construction of transmission and generation upgrades within the new england control area with particular emphasis on progress within designated congested areas dcas isone is directed to file these reports every  days beginning  days after the date of this order  in this order the commission agrees with two broad concepts in isones proposal first the commission finds it appropriate to establish icap regions but is concerned that the specific regions proposed by isone do not adequately reflect where infrastructure investment is needed especially with regard to the constrained area of southwest connecticut swct based on the analytical approach to reliability compensation issues established in the may   pjm order   the commission believes that a separate icap region for swct may be appropriate and is considering revising isones proposal to incorporate a separate swct region accordingly this order directs isone to submit a further filing addressing whether the commission should revise isones proposal to create a separate importconstrained icap region for swct additionally isone has indicated that an icap region cannot be a subset of an energy load zone the commission acknowledges this potential problem and finds that the institution of a separate energy load zone for swct in advance of the implementation of licap may be appropriate as it would send more appropriate price signals and more appropriately distribute reliability costs to those who benefit from them thus the commission also institutes an investigation and paper hearing in docket no el regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for swct and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of licap  second the commission agrees with the overarching concept of a demand curve but finds that more information is necessary to appropriately set the parameters of the demand curve for each icap region and is establishing a hearing for that purpose for example isone has proposed a methodology that may understate the level of capacity that may be transferred between icap regions the commission finds that as a result isone has not justified its proposed method for calculating the capacity transfer limits ctls the hearing established by the commission in addition to determining the demand curve parameters shall also determine the proper method for calculating ctls the appropriate method for determining the amount of capacity transfer rights ctrs to be allocated and the proper allocation of ctrs  until licap is implemented the commission will extend the peaking unit safe harbor push mechanism and will consider reliabilitymustrun rmr contracts to ensure that market participants are appropriately compensated for reliability services in the shortterm this order benefits customers by ensuring that there is sufficient generation available in new england to meet current and longterm needs ii background and procedural history a procedural history  this proceeding began on february   when devon power llc middletown power llc montville power llc norwalk power llc and nrg power marketing inc collectively nrg filed pursuant to section  of the federal power act fpa four costofservice rmr agreements covering  mw of generating capacity located within connecticut and the swct dcas these agreements were negotiated between nrg and isone in accordance with new england power pool nepool market rule  to provide compensation for generating units and associated reliability projects necessary for reliability in swct and connecticut nrg contended in its filing that the recentlyapproved new england standard market design nesmd market would not provide start printed page adequate compensation to the units covered by the contracts  on march   nrg filed an emergency motion seeking expedited issuance of an order accepting the rmr agreements for filing in that motion it contended that without assurance of costrecovery needed maintenance projects on the generating units could not be completed before the summer peak season on march   the commission issued an order accepting only a portion of the rmr agreements which allowed nrg to collect funds for needed summer maintenance through a tracking mechanism administered by isone  the april  order addressed the entirety of the rmr agreements in that order the commission rejected the rmr agreements and allowed collection of only goingforward maintenance costs through the tracking mechanism approved in the march  order in so doing the commission expressed concerns about the effect rmr contracts have on the competitive market and stated that isone “rather than focusing on and using standalone rmr agreements should incorporate the effect of those agreements into a markettype mechanism”  pursuant to section  of the fpa the commission directed revisions to nepool market rule  to lessen the need for rmr agreements these revisions allowed lowcapacity factor generating units operating in dcas to increase their bids to recover their fixed and variable costs and allowed the energy bids of peaking units to determine the locational marginal price lmp by creating the push bidding mechanism the commission also eliminated the ct proxy mechanism for mitigation additionally the commission directed isone “to file no later than march   for implementation no later than june   a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the icap or resource adequacy market    so that dcas may be appropriately compensated for reliability”  in its order on rehearing the commission affirmed push bidding and clarified its section  finding during the timeperiod in which these orders were issued the commission also rejected similar rmr contracts filed by ppl wallingford energy llc reiterating the concerns expressed in the april  order and the revisions directed by that order  in early  nrg returned to the commission to again seek rmr agreements for the devon montville and middletown generating units nrg also asked the commission to extend the tracking mechanism for collecting going forward maintenance costs for an additional year in an order issued march   the commission accepted the rmr agreements set the costs included in the agreements for hearing and conditioned them to terminate on the day a licap market or deliverability requirement is implemented in accordance with the april  order the commission reasoned that accepting the agreements for a limited term was appropriate given the poor performance under push of uniquely situated and aging devon montville and middletown generating units in an order issued on april   the commission also accepted an extension of the tracking mechanism for maintenance costs and conditioned the mechanism to terminate the day a licap market or deliverability requirement is implemented again the commission reasoned that continuing the tracker is a reasonable interim measure until market changes could be put into place in both orders the commission expressed confidence that once the market changes directed in the april  order were implemented outofmarket arrangements like rmr agreements and cost trackers would no longer be necessary b isones compliance filing  in compliance with the april  order isone filed a licap proposal on march   new england currently has a nonlocational icap mechanism in place in meeting its icap requirement currently a loadserving entity lse may procure resources located anywhere within the nepool control area however because of transmission constraints not all energy produced from qualified icap resources can be physically deliverable to all loads in new england isones licap proposal would take account of transmission constraints by imposing separate icap requirements for each of four regions maine classified as an exportconstrained region connecticut and northeastern massachusettsboston nemaboston classified as importconstrained regions and the remainder of new england rest of pool the amount of capacity that lses in one region could procure from another region would be limited by the ctls established by the iso between the two regions isone states that the ctls would be set at levels based on planning criteria that may be below the actual amount of realtime electric flow that the transmission interface is capable of accommodating  currently an lse is required to procure a specified amount of icap each month based on its projected peak demand all lses within new england can procure the resources from any units that are eligible to sell icap isone proposes through the use of a demand curve to move from this set amount of monthly icap to an amount that can vary monthly within certain parameters additionally isone proposes to impose certain limitations based on the location of the resources that can be used to satisfy an lses obligation to procure icap to implement these restrictions isone proposes to use four zones for icap the price of icap for each of the four regions would be determined monthly through the interplay of icap supply bids and an administrativelydetermined demand curve in a monthly isoadministered capacity auction in essence the icap requirement in a region and the regional icap price would be established at the point where supply as reflected in suppliers bids and demand as reflected in the administrativelydetermined demand curve clear the demand curve is designed to allow for more predictable icap revenues and more gradual price movements it also ensures that the region will compensate icap resources above and beyond  percent of the current capacity requirement referred to as the objective capability in new start printed page england which is  percent of peak load  when a demand curve is used to determine lses icap obligations the amount and price of that icap will be determined based on the height and slope that is used for the particular demand curve the design of the demand curve—its height and slope—requires selection of two points the selection of these points will affect the price and quantity of icap that lses must procure the first point sets the icap price at the point where average surplus capacity is equal to the cost of new entry isone calculated the average surplus as  percent of the capacity requirement isone states that this figure is intended to reflect the average surplus since  when new england became a summer peaking system isone believes it is reasonable to assume that on average there will be surplus capacity in the electricity market over time isone uses  per kilowatt month the current icap deficiency charge in the current capacity market as the cost of new entry the iso proposes to adjust the demand curve downward to account for inframarginal revenue from the energy market and ancillary service market this moves lowers the first point lower from  per kilowatt month to  per kilowatt month isone derived this amount based on the annual average inframarginal revenue for a gas turbine over the period of may  through december  which is estimated as  per kilowatt month  the second point is the point where the price of capacity is equal to zero which is where the demand curve itself crosses the x axis isone set this point at  percent of the capacity requirement isone selected this value for several reasons first it contends that planning studies showed that additional capacity has little impact on system reliability after achieving  percent surplus second isone believes that the demand curve should include all surplus capacity conditions that are likely to occur and that there is little likelihood that the surplus capacity will exceed that level finally isone asserts that the  percent value also makes new englands demand curve consistent with the nyisos statewide icap demand curve the demand curve is thus constructed by drawing the linear function that intersects the two points isone states that the linear demand curve provides a good first approximation of several different functional forms and has as well a moderate slope that may deter the exercise of market power by making it more difficult to withhold output in order to increase price  finally the proposed curve becomes horizontal to the left of  percent of the capacity requirement thus the icap price would be the same for all capacity levels between  percent and  percent of the capacity requirement isone believes that this last feature is unlikely to affect prices  isone proposes to phasein the demand curve over five years for importconstrained regions in part to avoid significant price shocks there during the phasein period prices derived by application of the demand start printed page curve in these constrained subregions would be capped at  per kilowatt month in the first year and would increase by  per year to  in the fifth year after the fifth year prices in the four regions would be determined without the use of price caps the fiveyear period coincides with the projected completion of key transmission projects in connecticut and nemaboston which the iso believes provides sufficient time for the development of additional capacity  during the five year transition period generating units in nemaboston and connecticut that had capacity factors of  percent or less in  and that are needed for reliability would be paid “transition payments” of  per kilowatt month a resource would actually receive the transition payment minus the spot auction clearing price for the constrained region thus the transition payment would function as a cap on the revenues above variable costs that a unit would be able to earn isone argues that the use of transition payments would allow for the elimination of the push mechanism entirely and would allow for the phaseout of rmr contracts a unit that qualifies for the transition payment that is not operating under an rmr contract would receive the transition payment until the end of the phasein period or until isone determines the unit is no longer needed for reliability the costs of the transition payments would be allocated to network load within each icap region the same manner in which the costs of rmr contracts are allocated currently as a result isone states that “one of the unfortunate features of the transition payments is that they cannot be hedged because they are an additional abovemarket payment needed to maintain reliability”  thus a customer in an importconstrained region nemaboston and connecticut would still incur the costs of transition payments even if that customer has contracted bilaterally for icap  under isones proposal a generator selling icap would be paid the market clearing price in the region in which the resource is located a participant serving load would buy icap at the market clearing price in the region where the load is located when the transfer capability between regions limits the ability to import capacity into one region in the icap market the icap prices in the two regions would differ the difference in regional prices represents a type of icap congestion charge similar to the congestion charge that arises when transmission capacity is congested in the spot energy market isone proposes to create capacity transfer rights to allow market participants to hedge these icap congestion costs capacity transfer rights in the icap market are similar to financial transmission rights ftrs in the spot energy market the holder of a capacity transfer right between two regions would receive congestion revenue—ie the difference in icap prices—between the two regions just as the holder of an ftr receives congestion revenue from the spot energy market isone proposes to allocate these icap congestion revenues to entities holding capacity transfer rights in the export and import constrained regions capacity transfer rights would be allocated to loads in importconstrained regions ie nemaboston and connecticut and to generators in exportconstrained regions ie maine in addition capacity transfer rights allocations would be made to original holders of entitlements to municipal utility resources constructed as pool planned units with lifeoftheunit contracts pursuant to section  of market rule  this “special allocation” of capacity transfer rights would be made to certain municipal utility resources constructed as pool planned units in importconstrained regions finally any transmission upgrades not funded through pool transmission rates that result in additional transfer capability that is associated with additional capacity transfer rights would be allocated to the entities that pay for the upgrades  as part of the licap proposal isone revised market rule  to include corresponding mitigation provisions based on the limited competition situation in the importconstrained icap regions the mitigation measures would apply to all resources in such regions that are authorized to sell capacity isone proposes to evaluate and deny requests by participants in importconstrained icap regions to cease selling icap within new england delisting chiefly the resource requesting to cease or reduce its icap sales would need to demonstrate that this was an economic decision for that unit to do so the resource must demonstrate that the expected revenue or the expected cost savings associated with the external sale or lack of a sale will exceed the expected icap revenues applicable transition payments and other market revenues that the resource would otherwise receive  isone also proposes conduct and market impact thresholds for the licap market in importconstrained icap regions isones proposal would employ a conduct and impact test and a reference levelbased mitigation scheme the icap reference level could be established in one of three ways  the iso would be authorized to determine the reference level based on a resources estimated goingforward costs net of expected market revenues  a resource may submit a proposed reference level with supporting documentation for review by the iso or  where no reference level is submitted or there is inadequate information to set a level a default icap reference level of  per kilowatt month which is intended to roughly account for a resources costs of providing icap rather than being delisted isone would utilize a conduct threshold of  per kilowatt month in importconstrained regions to identify economic withholding and a market impact threshold of  per kilowatt month prior to mitigating a resources offer the iso would attempt to contact the resource owner to provide an opportunity to explain the observed behavior in the event mitigation is necessary a default offer is established as the greater of  per kilowatt month the icap reference level or the estimated icap clearing price in the rest of pool region modifications have also been made to the energy market mitigation thresholds applicable to units receiving transition payments in importconstrained regions such units would be subject to a reduced energy offer price threshold of mwh and tighter startup and noload thresholds of  percent these units will also face a tighter operating reserve credit threshold of  percent  finally isone states that the submitted proposal is “not intended to be the final word on resource adequacy in new england” in conjunction with the licap process the iso initiated a regional dialogue which includes a more general initiative to address start printed page regional resource adequacy and to work toward a longterm solution this forum includes market participants and state regulators the iso recognizes that the current licap proposal may be modified or replaced by a different longterm regional resource adequacy mechanism thus isone commits to continuing the regional dialogue for at least  months from the date of implementation to continue to work toward a longterm regional resource adequacy mechanism isone will evaluate the performance of licap after one year of operation and eighteen months after implementation will be prepared to file a plan regarding longterm regional resource adequacy in new england that could affirm modify augment or replace the instant proposal  isone requests that the commission provide guidance on the issue of what entity should bear the responsibility for longerterm capacity procurement and longterm reliability isone states that the regional dialogue has not yet produced a consensus as to which entity should be responsible for ensuring longterm resource adequacy isones view is that the state regulatory officials and the distribution companies within each state regulated by those officials are best positioned to fulfill this role isone believes that commission guidance on this issue would significantly narrow the issues that must be addressed by new englands stakeholders in the regional dialogue iii notice of filing protests comments and interventions  notice of applicants filing

paper prepared by isone iv discussion a procedural matters  pursuant to rule  of the commissions rules of practice and procedure  cfr   the notices of intervention and timely unopposed motions to intervene serve to make the entities that filed them parties to this proceeding in addition several of the entities listed as parties in appendix a are proper parties to this proceeding by virtue of their previous interventions in the instant docket motions to intervene outoftime were filed by several entities pursuant to rule d of the commissions rules of practice and procedure given the interest of these entities in this proceeding and the absence of any undue prejudice or delay the commission finds good cause to grant their untimely unopposed motions to intervene outoftime rule a of the commissions rules of practice and procedure  prohibits an answer to a protest and answer unless otherwise ordered by the decisional authority we will accept the answers filed in the instant proceeding because they provided information that helped us in our decisionmaking process additionally in the interest of developing a full record for consideration during the subsequent procedures directed in this order the commission will grant the motions to lodge filed by the suppliers coalition and national grid et al  applicable statutory standard of review  as noted above isone submitted the instant filing as a compliance filing pursuant to rule  of the commissions rules of practice and procedure in response to the commissions directive in the april  order to “establish a mechanism implementing location or deliverability requirements in the installed capacity    or resource adequacy market in a manner that reduces reliance on reliability must run    agreements”  several entities have raised issues in their comments and protests regarding the propriety of submitting the instant filing as a compliance filing and whether section start printed page   or section   of the fpa should apply  several parties question whether isone properly filed the instant proposal as a “compliance filing” the ct dpuc and ct occ for example moved to reject the instant filing as an improper compliance filing arguing that the comprehensive nature of the market changes proposed in the filing and the rate increase isone acknowledges may result should not be approved by the commission through a compliance filing because to do so would “deprive potential objectors of the protections normally accorded for tariff increases”  they also contend that isones filing is an improper compliance filing under  cfr b   because it proposes to increase rates which they argue the april  order did not authorize united illuminating ui similarly states that the transitional payments included in the instant proposal amount to a new rate which it argues cannot be proposed and approved through a compliance filing  additionally many of the parties to this proceeding generally raise the issue of whether isone should have submitted the instant filing under section  or section  of the fpa of the entities raising this issue most contend that section  should apply ct dpuc and ct occ for example contend that the only possible basis for the instant filing is section  noting that isone does not have exclusive rights to make a section  filing and that the commissions original direction to make a compliance filing was issued pursuant to section  several other parties including the attorneys general of massachusetts and rhode island the massachusetts division of energy resources and rhode island commission and the new hampshire office of consumer advocate similarly contend that the standards of section  should apply to the instant proceeding  commission response the commission will apply the standards of section  of the fpa to the instant proceeding in the april  order the commission directed revisions to nepool market rule  “pursuant to section  of the federal power act”  specifically the commission directed isone to file “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the icap or resource adequacy market    so that capacity within dcas may be appropriately compensated for reliability”  in the july  order on rehearing the commission clarified that it was taking action under section  of the fpa formally stating that it “found that market rule     created an unjust and unreasonable result requiring a revision in the rule to solve these problems”  in light of these findings the commission finds it appropriate to continue to apply the standards of section  in its consideration of the instant compliance filing  applying the standard of section  of the fpa the issues here are whether the current market rules for icap in new england are “unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential” and whether new market rules approved or ordered by the commission are just and reasonable as noted above the commission has already satisfied the first requirement in this proceeding finding in the april  order and july  order that market rule  as it then existed “created an unjust and unreasonable result” as discussed in more detail below isones proposal must be modified to achieve a just and reasonable longterm solution therefore in the interim the commission will retain the push mechanism and allow for the filing of rmr contracts where justified until the licap market is implemented the commission finds that this provides a just and reasonable method of solving the reliability compensation issues present in new england  additionally we are not persuaded by the contention that the instant filing is an improper compliance filing first given the use of the section  procedures in this case the commission has not deprived any party of an opportunity to comment or protest contrary to the assertions of ct dpuc and ct occ notice of the isones filing was published in the federal register and a large number of parties submitted written comments or protests at the invitation of that notice the commission has carefully considered all of the comments and protests and as a result has provided substantial due process to all the parties before it in accordance with section  of the fpa furthermore we do not accept the assertions of ct dpuc and ct occ among others that the instant filing is an improper compliance filing because of its comprehensive nature and possibility for increased rates the commission rule cited by ct dpuc requiring that compliance filings “include only those changes required to comply with the order” and prohibiting such filings from including “other rate or tariff change filings” is inapplicable to the present proceeding additionally we note that here isone was directed to file “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the icap or resource adequacy market”  the tariff and rate changes included in the filing while extensive are directly related to the directive and are not separate rate or tariff changes therefore rejection of the filing is not warranted b analysis of isones proposal and commission response  the commission agrees with two broad concepts icap regions and the use of a demand curve the commission rejects the transition mechanism directs isone to submit a further filing addressing whether the commission should revise its proposal to create an additional icap region for swct establishes an investigation and paper hearing regarding the establishment of a separate swct energy load zone in advance of licap and establishes a hearing before an administrative law judge regarding the parameters of the demand curve and related issues as a result of these changes we will delay full implementation of the licap market until the conclusion of these proceedings we anticipate that this will permit implementation of licap in new england by january   we start printed page discuss our reasoning for this decision in the analysis that follows  in the pjm order the commission outlined an analytical approach it intends to follow in addressing reliability compensation issues such as those at issue in this proceeding this process begins with posing the question does this organized market exhibit material shortterm or longterm reliability compensation issues  shortterm reliability compensation issues relate principally to the appropriate compensation for units that are needed for reliability and are subject to mitigation with the result that the units are receiving noncompensatory revenue impacting their ability to provide service longterm reliability compensation issues relate principally to local capacity shortages identified in the organized markets reliabilitybased planning process resulting from the reasonably expected retirement of units or the need for new infrastructure that is not anticipated to be installed  if the inquiry shows that the organized market exhibits material reliability compensation issues the next step is to evaluate whether market design improvements can be implemented that will work to resolve the issues conversely if the inquiry does not find that the organized market exhibits material reliability compensation issues and the issue is of sufficiently narrow scope then significant focus on general design issues is not required and targeted approaches such as unit specific contracts or compensation schemes may be appropriate such demonstration must include a showing that the revenue produced by the proposed solution is adequate to actually solve the problem at hand and that the proposed solution includes safeguards to prevent the unwarranted exercise of market power beyond the recovery of such necessary revenue  in the case of isone the commission determines that it exhibits both short and longterm reliability compensation issues these issues have been clearly demonstrated in the filings for rmr contracts in nemaboston and swct these contracts were filed by isone because these units were not able to earn sufficient revenues through the markets to justify their continued operation in nemaboston these reliability concerns have been limited to the need for rmr contracts for a limited number of specific units that are needed to satisfy reliability because of the location of these units the rmr contracts were filed because specific units were needed not because there were inadequate resources within nemaboston in general as such reliability compensation appears to be more of a shortterm issue in nemaboston  in contrast the reliability problems in swct have involved the need to retain all or nearly all units within this region to maintain reliable service many of these units are old and inefficient and are unable to receive sufficient funds through the operation of the markets to justify their continued operation thus the concerns regarding swct are longterm in nature  under the policy developed in the pjm order the next step is to examine whether market design improvements can be implemented within new england to resolve these issues as discussed further below we believe that while the record is unclear on whether market design changes could resolve the issues within nemaboston market design changes could be implemented to resolve the reliability compensation issues within swct one market design change that was suggested in the pjm order was the use of locational markets for installed capacity or operating reserves for the constrained area the commission believes that designing and implementing a wellfunctioning and equitable licap market represents a significant step in resolving reliability compensation issues in fact we have identified locational installed capacity as a market design feature that can serve as a solution the new england market as a whole appears to have adequate capacity at the same time nearly all existing units within swct are needed for reliability additionally isone has also recently conducted a request for proposals to obtain additional resources in swct thus the use of a local capacity market would better reflect the value of capacity in swct than the existing systemwide capacity market thus the use of a locational capacity market could be a solution to the reliability compensation issues in swct  isone has filed a proposal that contains a locational capacity market the commission believes that isones licap proposal has elements that would help resolve the reliability compensation issues in new england in particular the concept of a demand curve for installed capacity has merit additionally the use of separate prices for capacity in different areas in new england also moves toward a licap market however as discussed further below we find that there are factual questions regarding certain elements of this proposal that need to be further explored at hearing  the commission finds that there are other elements of isones proposal that do not satisfy the criteria outlined in the pjm order specifically the commission is concerned that certain elements of isones proposal rely on nonmarket solutions to attempt to resolve these reliability compensation issues and that the regions chosen for the licap may not match the specific areas where capacity is constrained within new england thus the regions may not sufficiently value capacity within the constrained areas  first under the commissions policy the market design changes should provide sufficient revenues to satisfy the reliability compensation issues the commission cannot reasonably determine that isones proposed transition payments together with its proposed fiveyear phasein of licap will yield sufficient revenues for all generating resources during the phasein period under the proposal isone would cap the price that would be available to generators in the constrained areas during the phasein period in the first year the price caps would be  per kilowatt month this would not be a sufficient amount to resolve the reliability compensation issues within the constrained areas  however since the price caps would result in lower prices than those generated by the demand curve isone also proposes to pay a transition payment to low loadfactor units within the constrained areas the transition payments are set at  per kilowatt month for the first five years of the market the  figure is based on the average cost of push units in connecticut and nemaboston there was significant debate among intervening parties over whether or not this aspect of the proposal provides sufficient revenues since the payment is based on an average of the push limits it may not work to provide start printed page sufficient revenues for all generating units in particular the units within swct had a much higher cost than those located within nemaboston since isone would still allow rmr contracts for individual units its proposal may only appeal to those units whose costs were at or below the average push limits for other more expensive units it would appear that they would still have the option of obtaining rmr contracts  more importantly the transition payments create an unhedgeable cost to lses in importconstrained regions in other words the transition payments would be a nonmarket cost to lses within the import constrained areas the commission stated in the pjm order that ideally the market should encourage lses to engage in longterm bilateral contracting and locational requirements for icap could promote such contracting however isones transition payment proposal will not adequately promote bilateral contracting and in fact may discourage it isones proposal requires those parties who have contracted bilaterally for icap to pay the same transition payments as those lses that have not contracted bilaterally for icap thus the transition payments do not provide adequate incentives for lses to contract for supplies locationally to reduce their total costs the allocation method will also penalize lses that have already entered into bilateral arrangements the commission does not believe that a nonmarket solution such as the transition payments is consistent with the policy developed for reliability compensation issues in the pjm order therefore the commission does not believe that isones proposal provides a market solution that is consistent with the criteria discussed in the pjm order  the commission is also concerned that the proposed configuration of importconstrained regions may not be appropriate isone proposes a single icap region for the entire state of connecticut this is consistent with its current market design however there is a clear and extensive record that demonstrates a distinction in terms of reliability between swct and the other parts of connecticut this record includes reports and filings that detail the difficulties swct faces with regard to reliability for example isone concluded that “the existing southwestern connecticut electric power system does not meet north american electric reliability council nerc northeast power coordinating council npcc and nepool reliability performance standards”  furthermore when isone developed dcas with special measures for mitigating market power it classified swct as a dca distinct from the remainder of connecticut isone provides no justification for failing to acknowledge this distinction in its licap proposal the commission is concerned that isones proposal may not adequately recognize the value of resources within swct it also may result in customers in other parts of connecticut subsidizing customers within swct therefore the commission is not convinced that a single importconstrained area in connecticut would produce incentives to locate infrastructure in swct the location where it is most needed additionally it may not provide adequate compensation for resources to remain in swct thus failing to satisfy reliability compensation requirements of the commissions policy  thus the commission finds that while a market design solution would provide a reasonable solution to the reliability compensation issues in swct isones proposal must be revised to meet that objective  consequently the commission will adopt a market design solution for new england but will defer implementation of the licap proposal until the conclusion of the hearing proceedings established in this order the delay in implementation will allow time for a hearing to resolve the contested issues regarding the licap mechanism in addition it will also provide a firm timeline for implementation and thus an incentive to participants in the constrained areas to develop resources or transmission alternatives to help mitigate the rate impact of a licap mechanism in the interim to compensate resources within the constrained areas the commission will continue the operation of the push mechanism to reduce the impact of the mitigation measures on units that run infrequently additionally the commission will continue the use of rmr contracts for units that are needed for reliability but cannot earn sufficient revenues from the markets to continue operation  finally the commission believes that there may be merit in the early implementation of a separate energy load zone for swct the use of the entire state of connecticut may diminish the price signals in the constrained portion of the state since the cost of rmr contracts will also be paid by all load within the zone the use of a larger zone may result in some customers in connecticut subsidizing others therefore as discussed further below the commission will institute an investigation and paper hearing in docket no el regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for swct and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of licap isone is directed to address whether a separate energy load zone should be established for swct and implemented before licap  the commission addresses specific comments protests and issues related to the proposed licap mechanism in the paragraphs which follow  icap regions  as noted above isones proposal includes four regions for purposes of setting icap prices maine connecticut nemaboston and the remainder of new england connecticut is defined as an import constrained icap region equal to the connecticut load zone however some parties argue that swct should be its own importconstrained icap region lipa argues that isone has not justified why connecticut and swct were combined as one importconstrained region moreover lipa argues that studies used during consideration of this proposal clearly justify creating a separate region for swct lipa asserts that maintaining connecticut as a single constrained region distorts the market signals that licap is intended to send lipa argues that additional icap resources need to be located within swct to truly satisfy reliability concerns ppl parties argue that in establishing an importconstrained region for connecticut as a whole isones proposal would equate the locational value of a unit in severely constrained swct with the locational value of a unit in the relatively unconstrained areas in the rest of connecticut thus undervaluing units in the most needed locations and providing no incentive to direct new generation entry to the most critical sites  commission response the two geographic areas in new england that have reliability problems are nemaboston and swct which currently are identified as dcas while isones start printed page proposal separates nemaboston into its own region there is significant evidence that swct is the most heavily constrained area within new england recently the state of connecticut has stressed the need to focus on potential reliability problems in swct in a july   report the ct dpuc stated that “inadequate local generation and transmission congestion in swct make the region vulnerable to reliability problems in the event that demand is higher than expected or generation units or transmission lines serving the area are unavailable”  in december  the connecticut siting council csc submitted a tenyear forecast of loads and resources within the state which reported that “some subregions such as swct are threatened with supply deficiencies and voltage instability problems due to insufficient transmission and inadequate resources within the region”  that report also notes that “it is increasingly important for resources to be strategically located on the grid to ensure electric supply can technically and economically serve pockets of high demand”  additionally in its comments in this proceeding nrg points to the gap rfp through which isone procured reliability services which it could call on during possible emergency situations in this submittal isone stated that “as in years past the iso expects that the combination of electric load and operating reserve requirements in swct will exceed the resources available for the subregion in the summer of ”  nrg also notes a recent isonecommissioned study which concluded that while new england has sufficient capacity available to it in aggregate the capacity is not optimally located in the areas where it is needed for reliability specifically swct is identified in that study as an area where the amounts of capacity are verging on deficient the study concluded that capacity shortages in constrained areas of new england are most severe in swct and are much more severe than nemaboston  based on the assessments conducted by the state of connecticut and isone as well as the comments and protests considered by the commission in the instant proceeding the commission is concerned that the icap regions proposed by isone do not adequately reflect where infrastructure additions are needed most the infrastructure problem in swct has been accurately defined but the proposal submitted by isone does not appear to the commission to create the incentives needed to remedy this problem grouping swct with the rest of the state unfairly burdens connecticut customers that are not affected by limitations in transmission capacity in swct with this proposal for example capacity would be priced the same outside of swct as it is in swct this price signal sends the inaccurate message to potential investors that capacity is needed just as much in outside of swct as it is needed in swct additionally the commission fails to understand why nemaboston as a dca in new england is classified as a separate licap region while swct is not  based on the foregoing the commission believes that a separate swct icap region may be appropriate to ensure that the licap market in new england achieves the goals we outlined in the pjm order as a result isone is directed to submit a further filing in docket no er addressing whether the commission should revise its proposal to create a separate importconstrained icap region for swct the commission will require isone to submit this filing within  days from the date of this order and will permit responses to isones submittal to be filed within  days from the date isone makes its filing furthermore the commission notes that isone states in its answer that creating a separate icap region for swct would also involve creating a separate load zone in swct for pricing energy as noted above the commission believes that creating this separate load zone could have significant benefits even in advance of the implementation of licap as a result pursuant to section  of the fpa the commission will institute an investigation and paper hearing in docket no el regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for swct and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of licap the commission will require isone to address the issue of whether a separate energy load zone should be created for swct and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of licap in a filing to be made within  days from the date of this order in docket no el the commission will issue notice of isones filing and permit interested parties to intervene and file responses within  days of the date isone makes its filing  in cases where as here the commission institutes a section  proceeding on its own motion section b requires that the commission establish a refund effective date that is no earlier than  days after publication of notice of the commissions investigation in the federal register and no later than five months subsequent to expiration of the day period we will establish the statutorilydirected refund effective date in this context for the determination of regions in connecticut  days after publication in the federal register of this order initiating the commissions investigation in docket no el in addition section  requires that if no final decision has been rendered by that date the commission must provide its estimate as to when it reasonably expects to make such a decision given the times for filing identified in this order and the nature and complexity of the matters to be resolved the commission estimates that it will be able to reach a final decision by october    demand curve and capacity transfer  as described above isones proposed demand curve is structured on the basis of two points while there are numerous protests addressing the parameters of the demand curve there appears to be very little objection to the concept of a demand curve in fact many parties advocate a downwardly sloping demand curve the protests focus on the precise points that isone proposed to determine the height and slope of the demand curve in general representatives of lses and state government entities recommend changing the parameters in a way that would lower icap prices by contrast representatives of suppliers either support the isones parameters or recommend parameters that would raise icap prices for example coned favors raising the point at which the start printed page icap price becomes zero to  percent of objective capability  some parties including indicated suppliers and coned urge the commission to implement a compromise proposal that was approved in the new england stakeholder process by the markets committee and received a majority  percent vote from the participants committee the major difference between the compromise proposal and the proposal ultimately filed by isone is that the former included price floors for the maine and rest of pool regions as well as higher price caps and transition payments for generators in constrained areas both of which would result in higher icap payments in the relevant areas the compromise proposal is supported by hq energy services coned and the electric power supply association epsa  a group consisting of state governmental entities and transmission owners in nemaboston mass ag et al filed another alternative proposal also using a demand curve under this option the locational feature of the isos proposal would be removed and icap resources would be bought and sold through a single regionwide market instead of separate locational markets  national grid asserts that licap will not alleviate the fundamental constraints that cause the formation of load pockets and argues that the best way to ensure transmission adequacy would be to mandate a deliverability requirement across the transmission grid in its answer isone did not take a position on the merits of a deliverability requirement noting that there is nothing about the licap proposal that would preclude the adoption of a deliverability requirement if the stakeholders and the commission conclude that it would be beneficial  commission response we agree with isones overarching proposal to use a demand curve and in particular a downward sloping demand curve as part of the eventual licap mechanism in new england the commission finds that implementing a demand curve for icap will allow isones market design to more closely resemble that of the neighboring iso nyiso and to contribute to the elimination of seams between the two nyiso currently uses a demand curve to set icap prices within its territory nyiso also has locational requirement for procuring icap for lses located within new york city and long island the adoption of licap by isone would make its market design more consistent with that in effect in nyiso  while we agree with isones concept of a sloped demand curve we find that isone has not justified the specific parameters it proposes to determine the slope and height of the demand curve commenters raise important questions about these parameters that cannot be resolved based on the record in this proceeding these questions include if the height of the curve is to be determined at least in part by the cost of new entry what is the cost of new entry and does that cost vary among the regions what is a reasonable estimate of the net inframarginal revenues that could be expected from the energy markets and does that revenue vary among regions should the icap price reflect the cost of new entry net of inframarginal energy revenues when capacity equals i objective capability ii the historical average level of capacity relative to objective capability or iii some other level at what capacity level should the icap price fall to  should the height and slope of the curve be based on the cost of new entry or on other factors such as an estimate of the reliability value to loads of alternative levels of capacity and if the latter what are reasonable estimates of such reliability values to what extent do the parameters of the demand curve used by the nyiso affect the ability of new england to attract icap capacity and thus how should the new york parameters affect the parameters for new england the commission finds that the use of price floors as proposed in the compromise proposal are nonmarket mechanisms that may not send accurate price signals and may artificially inflate icap prices in regions with morethanadequate capacity levels  based upon the foregoing and the commissions own preliminary analysis we find that the parameters underlying the proposed demand curve have not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential or otherwise unlawful accordingly while we agree with the concept of a demand curve for the icap market we will set the parameters which will determine the slope and height of that curve for hearing procedures for the purpose of determining the just and reasonable icap demand curve for each icap region these hearing procedures will be limited to one year to ensure that the specific parameters of the curve are in place in advance of the january   implementation date of the licap market so that market participants can adequately prepare the commission will direct the presiding judge to ensure that an initial decision or settlement is issued by june   the presiding alj should structure the hearing schedule accordingly  certain parties have argued that the commission should adopt a deliverability requirement for icap supplies in new england rather than adopt a licap the commission directed isone to develop “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the icap or resource adequacy market” in the april  order isone elected to pursue a locational icap mechanism in the nearterm for among other things reasons of costs a reliable and extensive transmission system without substantial load pockets is important for a deliverability requirement the current transmission system in new start printed page england does not allow for deliverability across the entire region and the commission has been given no indication as to when the new england system would be physically capable of supporting a deliverability requirement the commission believes that the development of a transmission system that effectively eliminated import and exportconstrained regions in new england is an admirable objective however we recognize that the development of such infrastructure will take time and concerted effort isone has indicated that acceptance and implementation of the licap proposal would not preclude the introduction of a deliverability requirement at some point in the future the commission would welcome a proposal to implement a deliverability requirement in new england if and when isone and new england stakeholders collectively choose to pursue that until such time the commission believes that the licap proposal with the modifications discussed in this order represents an appropriate response to the reliability compensation issues we currently observe in new england i level of capacity available for transfer between regions  as noted earlier isone proposes to establish ctls between icap regions at levels below the actual amount of realtime electric flow that the transmission interfaces are capable of accommodating necpuc mass ag et al and others object to isones proposal to underestimate the amount of capacity that can be delivered into the importconstrained regions  in its answer isone argues that increasing its proposed ctls would be detrimental to the market isone asserts that setting transfer limits while recognizing excess capacity may depress prices and undervalue the resources within the importconstrained region which decreases the likelihood of either new generation entry or transmission expansion in the constrained region  commission response the commenters criticisms of isones proposed method for determining ctls raise issues that the commission will set for hearing to determine the costs and benefits of understating the amount of transmission transfer capability that is actually available to procure icap resources across regions the presiding judge is directed to consider the appropriate method for calculating ctls in the hearing that we establish in this order ii capacity transfer rights  as noted earlier isone proposes to allocate a portion of the capacity transfer rights across the nemaboston import interface the transmission interface between the nemaboston and rest of pool to municipal utilities in nemaboston that have ownership entitlements in pool planned units in rest of pool transcanada power marketing ltd transcanada and indicated suppliers disagree with the proposal transcanada argues that this special award of capacity transfer rights has no direct relationship to the actual load served by the municipal utilities in nemaboston and improperly presumes that the municipal utilities should be given priority rights over the limited transfer capacity into the region indicated suppliers argue that a “special allocation” of capacity transfer rights should be extended to other participants with longterm contracts for capacity located outside of constrained areas conversely massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company and reading municipal light department mmwec and reading urge the commission to ensure that the “special” capacity transfer right allocation be maintained as essential to any determination that the licap proposal is just and reasonable mmwec and reading believe that any imposition of licap in new england should include a proper recognition of prior investments in pool planned units and should minimize the impact of a new regulatory paradigm upon those longterm investments  duke energy north american llc duke seeks to clarify that generators that have increased transfer capability on constrained icap interfaces prior to the proposals effective date would be allocated capacity transfer rights as described in section  of the proposal additionally mmwec and reading have uncovered two problems that they assert must be addressed first mmwec and reading believe that isones proposed text of section  reads as though the allocation is to the pool planned unit itself second in reviewing table  to section  which lists the municipal utilities receiving special capacity transfer rights mmwec and reading believe that it does not include the wakefield municipal gas  light department which is a nemabased municipal utility and thus entitled to a share of whatever capacity transfer rights based on pool planned units allocation is accepted or approved by the commission  commission response capacity transfer rights should be allocated in a way that allows the benefits of capacity transfer rights to be received by those who ultimately pay the costs of the transmission system including market participants that have funded specific upgrades that increased transfer capacity that is because capacity transfer rights depend on the amount of transmission capacity in new england so those paying for the transmission capacity should receive its benefits we endorsed a similar policy with respect to the allocation of auction revenue rights arrs in new england in an order issued december   arrs entitle the holder to receive the revenues from the sale at auction of ftrs which like capacity transfer rights depend on the amount of transmission capacity in new england  this is not to say however that capacity transfer rights must always be allocated to those who directly pay for the embedded costs of new englands transmission grid indeed in the december   order we accepted a proposal to allocate arrs to “congestion paying lses” even though not all congestion paying lses pay transmission costs we did so because we expected that such congestion paying lses would pass on the benefits of arrs to the retail loads that they serve and these retail loads would ultimately also bear the costs of the transmission system similarly we would find it acceptable to allocate start printed page capacity transfer rights either to those who directly pay the fixed costs of the new england transmission system or to those who serve the retail loads that ultimately pay these fixed costs however as a general matter we would not find it acceptable to allocate capacity transfer rights to generators in maine that have not contributed to the cost of the transmission system although it would be acceptable to allocate capacity transfer rights to generators in maine or in other regions of new england that have contributed to the cost of the transmission system  the commission is unable to determine whether isones proposed allocation of capacity transfer rights is consistent with this principle and thus we will set for hearing the issue of the allocation of capacity transfer rights in particular the hearing should determine whether and to what extent particular generators in maine have paid for transmission upgrades that increase transfer capability with the rest of the pool and thus should be assigned corresponding capacity transfer rights the hearing should also determine the appropriate allocation of capacity transfer rights for those lses including municipal utilities who are the original holders of lifeoftheunit contracts for pool planned units the hearing should also address the extent to which lses outside of the importconstrained regions should be allocated capacity transfer rights  implementation date and transition mechanisms  isones proposal relies on two transition mechanisms  a transition payment of  per kilowatt month to be paid to those units in constrained subregions which had  capacity factors of  percent or less and  a series of price caps in importconstrained regions over a fiveyear phasein period after the fifth year ending may  the caps would expire leaving prices in all subregions determined by the downwardsloping demand curve during the phasein period the constrained subregions would clear at the higher of the cap or the price in the rest of pool subregion numerous parties argue against the implementation of these transition mechanisms  commission response for the reasons that follow the commission will reject the proposed transition mechanisms and the proposed transition payments instead the commission directs that the licap mechanism when implemented by january   as directed by this order become effective without the use of the phasein or transition provisions  several intervenors argued that the commission should defer implementation of the licap proposal to accommodate the  month regional dialogue process that isone proposed the commission will defer implementation until january   but does not believe it would be appropriate to direct isone and stakeholders to develop a modified licap proposal in the regional dialogue process the commission directed isone and its stakeholders to develop a mechanism in the april  order however these discussions did not produce consensus on a mechanism further the commission does not believe that isones proposal if implemented without modification would resolve new englands reliability compensation issues therefore the commission does not believe it is appropriate to delay action on isones proposal to allow additional time for stakeholder discussions rather the commission believes that the approach taken in this order which is to identify the date when licap will be implemented and establish proceedings to address remaining issues will better address the situation we believe that deferring the implementation of licap until january   will allow participants in importconstrained regions an opportunity to move toward the development of needed infrastructure prior to the realization of full licap rates infrastructure projects are proceeding in both connecticut and nemaboston and a deferral of licap should provide an incentive for timely completion of the addition of infrastructure in these areas the commission finds a delay in the implementation date of licap is preferable to the transition mechanisms proposed by isone which were in large part simply outofmarket arrangements to monitor the progress of infrastructure development the commission will require isone to submit a report to the commission every  days beginning  days from the date of this order updating the progress made in the siting permitting and construction of transmission and generation upgrades within the new england control area with particular emphasis on progress within dcas while we recognize that isone is not the entity responsible for siting and permitting decisions it is in the best position to keep the commission informed regarding the progress of infrastructure development in new england  until implementation the new england market will continue to operate under the existing icap rules as well as the existing push mechanism and any existing rmr agreements if additional rmr contracts are needed or require renewal the commission expects the parties to those contracts and isone to negotiate and file under section  of the fpa oneterm contracts with the single term expiring when the licap mechanism is implemented the commission will consider the need for these contracts and the justness and reasonableness of the rates proposed therein as they are filed while using current icap rules in the period between now and january   is not where the commission envisioned the nepool capacity market to be the stakeholder process did not result in a mechanism that is just and reasonable and can be implemented in the near term our decision to delay implementation and rely on the existing rules and rmr agreements will produce a just and reasonable result in the shortterm while allowing changes to be made and infrastructure to be built which will allow the basic licap framework we approve in this order to produce a just and reasonable result in the longterm  miscellaneous issues i mitigation measures  the mitigation measures proposed by isone did not elicit many comments or protests lipa argues that isones proposed tests for delisting units—which would require that the delisting resource demonstrate that expected revenues or cost savings associated with the external sale or delisting would exceed the expected revenues the resource would otherwise receive—will inhibit transactions between markets lipa asserts that there are multiple reasons for a resource to delist beyond short term revenue tests such as lower revenues that result from a longerterm capacity commitment or the perceived stronger creditworthiness of a commitment with an external party pseg requests that the commission reject this mitigation measure arguing that it would allow start printed page isone to employ a market power mitigation measure without any finding that the proposed actions would have a significant market impact as with other mitigation rules  commission response the commission will accept the mitigation measures proposed by isone with respect to reference level calculations and conduct and impact thresholds but rejects the delisting measures under isones proposal participants seeking to delist any resource in an importconstrained icap region would be required to demonstrate to isone that the expected revenue associated with sale of icap outside of the nepool control area or the expected cost savings attributable to delisting will exceed the expected icap revenues and other market revenues that the resource would receive if it did not delist where unable to make such a demonstration isone proposes to have the authority to deny any delisting request the commission finds that isone should not have the authority to secondguess a generators business decisions regarding whether to sell into the icap market and thus rejects this provision moreover since participation in the icap market is voluntary it is not appropriate to prohibit or limit a generators decision to cease participating in the icap market the commission will not accept additional measures that are designed for the energy markets these measures are primarily designed for units that receive transition payments the commission is eliminating transition payments consequently this proposed measure will not apply ii role of the iso  isone has sought guidance on the issue of what entity should bear the responsibility for longerterm capacity procurement and longterm reliability the commission addressed a similar issue in the pjm order as a general matter the commission believes that the market design of the rto or iso should be structured to send appropriate price signals and thus provide an incentive for load to procure capacity to meet their longterm requirements through the regional transmission planning process and the determination of the appropriate icap requirements for lses isones role is to establish the infrastructure levels needed for the system to operate reliably however it is lses that have the primary responsibility for longerterm capacity procurement and obtaining sufficient supplies to ensure longterm reliability the role of the rto or iso in this process is at most to provide a backstop to these efforts however the commission is concerned that if an rto or iso negotiates contracts to procure power it may assume an interest in market prices which could sacrifice its independence and change its incentives thus the commission would only consider a backstop role for the iso or rto after a showing that appropriate changes to the market design had been implemented and had not proven sufficient to solve the problem or that market design changes are infeasible iii local scarcity pricing and a cooptimized market for energy and operating reserves  we noted in the pjm order that “recognizing shortterm scarcity of operating reserves may be a valuable component of an overall market design    the inclusion of such a feature could also in part reduce generator reliance upon unit specific agreements in situations where units needed for reliability are not recovering their costs and are eligible for a contract” high locational prices in isones spot markets can signal when and where there is a need for additional capacity isone recently added a scarcity pricing feature to spot market rules for its markets whereby spot market prices would be increased at times up to mwh during periods of scarce supplies when new england as a whole is experiencing shortages of operating reserves this pricing feature is valuable because it sends a strong signal when capacity is tight that capacity is needed the resulting high prices also provide revenue to owners of generation capacity that is operated during a limited number of hours of very high demand and thus may reduce the need for rmr contracts for units that otherwise receive insufficient market revenue to support their operations  isones scarcity pricing is triggered only by new englandwide reserve shortages however because of transmission constraints scarcity conditions may arise in smaller areas within new england reflected in an inability to fully meet local reliability requirements even when capacity throughout new england as a whole is sufficient to meet load and operating reserves any scarcity conditions that arise in smaller areas within new england do not trigger the scarcity pricing provisions this feature may limit the ability of spot market prices to signal the need for additional capacity in local areas modifying isones scarcity pricing mechanism so that prices would automatically increase in local areas that experience local scarcity conditions might improve the markets price signals and increase the ability of generators needed for local reliability to recover their costs in the market such a modification could complement and reinforce a licap mechanism for example local scarcity pricing could further encourage lses in a capacitytight region to enter into contracts with resources in order to hedge against possible high spot energy prices however local scarcity pricing may be easier to implement in the presence of a locational operating reserves spot market that is cooptimized with the spot energy market which would recognize operating reserve requirements in local areas isone does not currently operate a locational operating reserves market but it has indicated that it is planning to implement cooptimized energy and reserves markets in   we wish to ensure that a broad array of options is considered for addressing new englands locational needs for capacity therefore we will require isone to consider the advantages and disadvantages of modifying its existing scarcity pricing mechanism so that it would trigger as a result of local scarcity conditions isones process should include stakeholder input and consideration of stakeholder proposals we will require isone to file a report on this investigation and the results of the stakeholder process within  days of this order if isone files to implement cooptimized energy and reserves markets within  days of this order it may elect to include the report on scarcity pricing as

al issued june   joseph t kelliher commissioner concurring i am writing separately to explain my views on the implementation date of a locational installed capacity licap market in new england i concur with the order that a licap market should not be implemented before january   the purpose of establishing a licap market is to ensure there is adequate electricity generation in new england particularly in southwest connecticut and northeastern massachusettsboston the record shows that there is insufficient generation in these two areas of new england for a licap market to be effective the transmission system must be strong enough to permit generation interconnections unfortunately the transmission system in southwest connecticut is notoriously weak and at present cannot accommodate significant generation additions it is important to give new england enough time to make necessary transmission upgrades the order provides for an initial decision from an administrative law judge by june   to define the appropriate methodology for determining capacity transfer limits between icap regions the amount and allocation of capacity transfer rights for purposes of each licap market and the parameters of the demand curve that will apply in each icap region the order also sets an implementation date for licap markets of january   i would have deferred selecting a specific implementation date for licap markets until after the initial decision that would have given the commission the flexibility to select an appropriate date for implementing licap based on an understanding of the progress—if any—towards strengthening the transmission grid in southwest connecticut and northeastern massachusettsboston until implementation of a licap market the commission will extend the peaking unit safe harbor push mechanism and consider reliabilitymustrun contracts to ensure generators receive just and reasonable compensation experience with the push mechanism has proved disappointing and reliabilitymustrun contracts may be the superior means to assure just and reasonable compensation during the interim joseph t kelliher commissioner end preamble footnotes

advanced terms or use the preset filters and keywords but you cannot use both in the same search about modifiers and boolean search connectors using the term modifiers below you will be able to construct a rich query to find results for your search first some important background a query is broken up into terms and operators there are two types of terms single terms and phrases a single term is a single word such as test or hello a phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as hello dolly multiple terms can be combined together with boolean operators to form a more complex query each term can be further revised by a term modifier wildcard searches you can perform a wildcard search within a single term but not within a phrase the single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced for example to search for text or test you can use the search tet multiple character wildcard searches looks for zero or more characters for example to search for test tests or tester you can use the search test you can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term tet note however that you cannot use a  or  symbol

labour those that are misspelled and those that include a base word but include prefixes andor suffixes search results for the word plan will include preplan and planning to do a fuzzy search use the tilde symbol  at the end of a singleword term for example to search for a term similar in spelling to roam use the fuzzy search roam proximity searches you can find words that are within a specific distance away from one another to perform a proximity search use the tilde symbol  followed by the number of words that can separate your search words for example federal corporation will find federal

indicate that the word treasury is more important in your search use the query treasury guidance the higher the boost factor the more relevant that term will be in your result set boolean operators of course the search query also supports the standard set of boolean operators to specify how your search terms should be combined the default operator is or so if there is no operator specified the query engine assumes an or the or operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document the and operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document the not operator excludes documents that contain the term after not it cannot be used with just one term specified in the search the near operator links terms and finds a matching document if the terms are located within five words grouping we support using parentheses to group clauses to form subqueries this can be useful if you want to control the boolean

commissioners jon wellinghoff chairman philip d moeller john r norris and cheryl a lafleur devon power llc docket no er order denying rehearing issued october    on remand from the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit the commission issued an order in this proceeding in which it determined that the auction results and transition payments arising from a contested settlement approved by the commission were tariff rates not contract rates and that nevertheless the commission had discretion to approve a settlement provision imposing a more stringent application of the statutory just and reasonable standard of review commonly known as the mobile sierra “public interest” standard of review  the new england power generators association inc nepga and several other entities collectively referred to as the joint applicants filed requests for rehearing of the remand order  in this order the commission denies rehearing as discussed below  i background  under section  of the federal power act fpa all rates associated with the transmission sale or resale of electric energy in interstate commerce must be just and reasonable  the result of two supreme court cases the mobilesierra doctrine prescribes a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review under certain circumstances  under the mobilesierra doctrine the commission “must presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale energy contract meets the statutory ‘just and reasonable’ requirement”  this presumption may be overcome only if the commission concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest  in  the commission approved a contested settlement agreement redesigning the new england market for installed electric generation capacity settlement  the settlement established a forward capacity market which would use annual auctions to set the price of capacity  in these auctions capacity is procured three years in advance of its use with the first auction procuring capacity for the oneyear period beginning june    to address the period between the effective date of the settlement and june   the settlement included a transition mechanism which provided fixed payments to capacity assignments   of the  parties to the settlement proceedings eight opposed the settlement  notwithstanding the opposition the commission approved the settlement because as a package it presented a just and reasonable outcome for this proceeding consistent with the public interest  the commission found that the settlement provided a necessary solution to serious deficiencies in the new england market that were impairing critical infrastructure development and threatening reliability  of particular interest here section c of the settlement imposed the mobilesierra “public interest” standard on certain future challenges to the auction results and transition payments  the commission found that this provision balanced the need for rate stability with the statutory requirement that rates be just and reasonable  on appeal the dc circuit rejected most of the petitioners’ challenges to the commission’s orders  however the court agreed with petitioners that applying the mobilesierra “public interest” standard to challenges by nonsettling parties “unlawfully deprived nonsettling parties of their rights under the federal power act”  the supreme court reversed that determination finding that “the public interest standard is not as the dc circuit presented it a standard independent of and sometimes at odds with the ‘just and reasonable standard’… rather the public interest standard defines ‘what it means for a rate to satisfy the just and reasonable standard in the contract context’”  the supreme court reasoned that mobilesierra “is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties  it applies as well to challenges initiated by third parties” thus the commission must presume “that contract rates freely negotiated between sophisticated parties meet the just and reasonable standard”  the supreme court remanded to the dc circuit for further consideration however the question of whether the auction results and transition payments subject to the mobilesierra clause in the settlement are “contract rates” to which the commission is required to apply the mobilesierra “public interest” presumption  if not the dc circuit was to consider whether the commission has discretion under the circumstances to approve the settlement provision imposing the mobilesierra “public interest” standard on future challenges to those results and payments  on remand the dc circuit stated that the commission had not articulated a rationale “for its discretion to approve a mobilesierra clause outside the contract context or an explanation for exercising that discretion here”  accordingly the court asked the commission to explain “why if the auction rates are not contract rates they are entitled to mobilesierra treatment”  the court also asked the commission to answer “just how do the auction rates reflect market conditions similar to freelynegotiated contract rates  or does the commission base its asserted discretion on some other ground”  in response to the dc circuit’s order the commission found that the settlement rates at issue here are not “contract rates” that under mobilesierra require a presumption that the rates are statutorily just and reasonable  nonetheless the commission concluded that it has the discretion to consider and decide whether future challenges to the settlement rates must overcome a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review  the commission found that based on the circumstances of this proceeding it was appropriate for the commission to exercise that discretion in accepting the mobilesierra provision in the underlying settlement ii requests for rehearing  as noted above the commission received two requests for rehearing of the remand order   nepga contends that the commission erred in finding that rates set in isone’s forward capacity market are not contract rates nepga argues that the rates are indeed contract rates  nepga states that the uniform commercial code ucc and leading treatises on contracts make clear that a sale by auction is a type of sales contract  nepga explains that new england’s forward capacity auctions are “reverse auctions” in which sellers react to the “descending clock” auctioneer’s prices but the results are still prices  nepga further explains that these capacity auctions produce binding mutual obligations to provide and pay for a specific quantity of capacity at a specific time  nepga also contends that the competitive nature of auctions creates a multilateral process of suppliers and bidders that is more akin to bilateral arrangements in contracts than rates set unilaterally by tariff  nepga explains that unlike a unilateral tariff rate capacity auction prices are not dictated by a single seller who is free to propose new rules or results  nepga further contends that unlike unilateral rates filed by sellers auctions impose an obligation on suppliers to deliver a specific product at a specific price place and time  nepga also points out that the commission’s regulations provide that contracts can create tariffs and that tariffs can contain contracts in the form of rate schedules and service agreements  nepga further contends in support of its claim that the rates are contract rates that the forward capacity auctions represent contract rates regardless of the opposition to the underlying settlement  nepga states that the commission approved the settlement and so imposed an auction mechanism  nepga likens commission approval of the settlement to other changes the commission has made to its rules despite significant opposition and in doing so requires rates previously set by contract to be abrogated or modified  nepga also points out that the rehearing requests filed in response to the commission’s approval of the settlement did not challenge the auction mechanism as a rate methodology but rather the standard of review that would be applied to auction results  nepga further contends that if opposition to the settlement was dispositive of the question of whether forward capacity auction results are contract rates then the supreme court would not have remanded that question   nepga also argues that the contractual nature of capacity auction obligations is not undermined by the fact that the auctions are mandatory and conducted according to rules set forth in isone’s tariff  nepga explains that all auctions run according to some system of rules just as all contracts are struck within a system of rules such as the ucc  nepga also contends that the auction results are not mandatory because as the dc circuit has observed load has various options for meeting its forward capacity market obligations  nepga also disputes the commission’s finding that the forward capacity auction does not produce contract rates because utilities buying capacity in the forward capacity market cannot be said to be contracting with the capacity sellers  nepga contends that when isone purchases capacity from sellers it is either for itself or acting as an agent for entities that must fulfill capacity obligations  nepga further contends that the commission’s holding is contrary to statements made by the commission in order no  and other orders regarding the role of independent system operators and regional transmission organizations as contracting counterparties in market transactions including capacity auctions  nepga also points out that in a rehearing order in this proceeding the commission rejected an argument that market rules and tariffs are not contracts to which mobilesierra can apply  nepga contends that the commission has failed to reconcile its findings in the remand order with its previous findings in this proceeding   finally nepga argues that the commission’s discussion of transition rates is outside the scope of the remand  nepga states that although the supreme court remanded the questions whether the auction results and the transition payments are contract rates the dc circuit held that remand was moot with regard to the transmission payments  by contrast the joint applicants support the commission’s determination that the auction results and transition payments were tariff not contract rates  the joint applicants contend though that the commission erred in concluding that it has the discretion and authority to apply a mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review to future challenges to those tariff rates as if they were in fact contract rates  they state that the supreme court has rejected arguments that sought to ground mobilesierra in the commission’s approval of public utility rates  specifically the joint applicants point out that in morgan stanley the court dismissed contentions that mobilesierra could not apply because the commission had never reviewed the marketbased rate agreements at issue in that case  the joint applicants also contend that the remand order wrongly suggests that the commission has discretion to estop future commissions from modifying the rates absent serious future harm to the public interest  the joint applicants explain that morgan stanley rejected such an estoppel view of mobilesierra  they state that the supreme court reaffirmed in both nrg andmorgan stanley that the mobilesierra “public interest” standard operates only in a contract context  the joint applicants contend that because the auction rates are not contract rates there is no contractual agreement that imbues the rates with reasonableness and there is no contractstability interest to protect  the joint applicants disagree with the commission’s assertion that because the mobilesierra “public interest” test is one application of the statute’s “just and reasonable” language the commission has the discretion to choose to apply that more rigorous standard outside the contract context  the joint applicants explain that the supreme court has made clear that the mobilesierra “public interest” test for contractrate changes only provides “the definition of what it means for a rate to satisfy the justandreasonable standard in the contract context”  in addition the joint applicants contend that the commission’s confidence in the ability of the marketbased features of the forward capacity auction to produce just and reasonable results derives not from the consent of the buyers and sellers as it would in a contract context but instead in the commission’s faith in the tariff rules creating those rates  using this logic the joint applicants argue that the commission could apply the more stringent mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review in every noncontract case without any legal basis to distinguish between marketbased capacity prices as compared to all other marketbased rate mechanisms currently setting rates in new england and throughout the nation  finally the joint applicants argue that the commission is wrong to limit a future commission’s discretion to review tariff rates absent a showing of serious harm to the public interest iii discussion  for the reasons discussed below the commission denies rehearing  nepga argues that the commission erred in considering the rates at issue as anything other than contract rates which would be subject to a mobilesierra “public interest” presumption of reasonableness while the joint applicants argue that the commission erred in suggesting that the rates at issue here while they are tariff rates can nevertheless be made subject to the more stringent application of the statutory just and reasonable standard of review commonly known as the mobile sierra “public interest” standard of review  we reject both arguments a contract vs tariff rates  the commission reaffirms its findings that the rates set by the forward capacity auctions represent tariff not contract rates and that therefore they are not entitled to a presumption that they are just and reasonable  the commission does not dispute as nepga point out that conventional auctions can result in a contract between a buyer and a seller  however the rates produced by these capacity auctions nevertheless are tariff not contract rates the rates produced by the forward capacity auction are in fact determined unilaterally by the isone tariff  the results of the capacity auctions although possessing certain contractual characteristics do not constitute contracts between buyers and sellers  the “demand” or “load” side of each auction is set not by the loadserving entities that ultimately pay for the capacity but by iso new england inc isone which determines the estimated amount of capacity – known as the installed capacity requirement – that the system as a whole will require for reliability three years in the future  isone then announces the auction starting price which is initially twice the estimated cost of new entry and capacity providers state how much capacity they would offer at that price  if more capacity is offered than required to meet the installed capacity requirement isone employs a “descending clock” process lowering the offering price until the quantity of capacity offered equals the installed capacity requirement  isone then assesses each utility a capacity charge equal to the utility’s share of the installed capacity requirement multiplied by the market clearing price   thus although a conventional auction can result in a contract between the buyer and seller the forward capacity auctions bear little resemblance to a conventional auction  the utilities “buying” capacity in the forward capacity market have no role in the auction at all and cannot be said to be “contracting” with the capacity sellers indeed it can be said that they themselves are not “buying” capacity but rather are merely paying the rate that isone charges to recover isone’s costs of buying capacity  that is rather than agreeing to pay a specific seller an amount set by a voluntary bid for a particular property – as in a conventional auction – the “buyers” in the forward capacity auction are assessed a standard rate based upon the intersection of the installed capacity requirement set by isone and the offers made by the capacity sellers  while the bids of the capacity sellers commit them to supply the amount they offer at the clearing price there is nothing that can be reasonably viewed as voluntary agreements of any sort between the sellers of the capacity and the “buyers” in the auction  thus the standard capacity charge paid by each “buying” utility in the system for its share of the installed capacity requirement more closely resembles a tariff rate paid to isone to compensate isone for costs that isone has incurred   moreover it cannot be said that isone is acting as an agent for capacity buyers  although the forward capacity auction creates a multilateral process of suppliers and bidders the ultimate purchases are made unilaterally via isone’s tariff  isone is at the center of this capacity market  through its forward auctions it procures capacity to meet its installed capacity requirement  under isone’s tariff loadserving entities then pay isone for that capacity  moreover as nepga points out the auction results are not per se mandatory because load has options for meeting its forward capacity obligations including the ability to selfsupply capacity  thus there is no contractual obligation for load to fulfill its capacity obligations directly through the auctions  under the commission’s regulations a rate schedule may take the form of a contract but in this instance isone’s tariff does not create a contractual obligation by buyers to purchase capacity from sellers of that capacity  to the contrary the standard capacity charge paid by each utility in the isone system for its share of the installed capacity requirement more closely resembles a tariff rate     nonsettling parties are equally obligated to pay the rates derived from the rate methodology resulting from the settlement  these obligations arise because the commission found that the settlement and the resulting market rules were just and reasonable not because the nonsettling parties are subject to any contractual obligations under the settlement  by choosing to purchase capacity through the forward capacity auctions these nonsettling parties are obligated to make payments under isone’s tariff   we find nepga’s arguments with regard to the consistency of the remand order with order no  and other orders to be similarly unpersuasive  in order no  the commission addressed credit reforms in organized wholesale electric markets by inter alia requiring each independent system operator iso or regional transmission organization rto to file tariff revisions to protect against the bankruptcy of a market participant  the commission offered several options for isos and rtos to comply with this requirement including the development of tariff revisions that would establish the iso or rto to act as the central counterparty to transactions with market participants  that does not mean that there is a direct contractual relationship between sellers of capacity and buyers of capacity  more recently the commission conditionally accepted tariff revisions filed by pjm interconnection llc pjm designating pjm as a counterparty to transactions with market participants  in those revisions pjm defines counterparty as establishing pjm “as the contracting party in its name and own right and not as an agent to an agreement or transaction with market participants or other entities including the agreements and transactions with customers regarding transmission service and other transactions under the pjm tariff…”  in any event any discussion of whether isone will choose to act as counterparty in market transactions is speculative because the commission has extended the filing deadline for the tariff revisions until january    nevertheless even if isone chooses to designate itself as the official counterparty that does not necessarily create a contractual relationship between sellers and buyers  as discussed above the terms of purchase through the forward capacity auction are set unilaterally by tariff  isone may purchase capacity to meet its installed capacity requirement and isone establishes rates for this capacity in its tariff but that does not create a contractual relationship between generators and loadserving entities   finally although the dc circuit found that any controversy related to the transition payments paid to generators was moot the commission included the transition payments in its analysis of the auction rates because they both were derived from the settlement  we recognize here however as we did in the remand order that the last transition payment was made over a year ago and therefore the controversy as to whether these payments represent contract or tariff rates is now moot  b commission discretion to accept “public interest” standard  the commission also denies rehearing regarding its discretion to accept application of a mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review  under mobilesierra as interpreted by the supreme court in morgan stanley the commission must presume that rates set by power sales contracts that are freely negotiated at arm’slength between willing buyers and sellers meet the statutory “just and reasonable” standard  this presumption may be overcome only if the commission concludes that the underlying rate “adversely affects the public interest”  thus this “public interest” presumption demands a more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard when the commission reviews rates terms and conditions of freely negotiated power sales contracts both on initial review and if and when those rates terms and conditions are later challenged  nevertheless the “public interest” presumption is not a different standard of review rather “the term … refers to the differing application of the statutory justandreasonable standard” which is the only statutory standard of review under the fpa thus rather than being an extrastatutory test separate and apart from the “just and reasonable” standard the “public interest” presumption represents a point on a broad continuum of approaches employed to meet the statute’s requirement that rates terms and conditions be just and reasonable  morgan stanley makes clear that the mobilesierra “public interest” presumption applies only to contract rates and morgan stanley does not address the commission’s discretion to accept different applications of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard for noncontract rates  the supreme court has explained that the “just and reasonable” standard is the only statutory standard under the fpa for assessing wholesale rates whether set by contract or tariff  under this statutory “just and reasonable” standard the commission is not “bound to any one ratemaking formula” rather the commission must interpret and necessarily has the discretion to interpret how this statutory standard is to be implemented  indeed because “the statutory requirement that rates be ‘just and reasonable’ is obviously incapable of precise judicial definition” courts have long “afforded great deference to the commission in its rate decisions”  that is the fpa requires only that rates be just and reasonable it does not specify the manner in which that general formulation must be implemented in any particular context    given the flexibility inherent in the statutory “just and reasonable” standard the commission may require varying types and degrees of justification for challenges to particular rates or practices depending on the circumstances  when power sales rates are set by contracts resulting from fair arm’slength negotiations between willing sellers and buyers sierra and the more recent morgan stanley require application of the more rigorous “public interest” presumption when the commission is faced with a challenge to such contractually agreedto rates  nothing in the fpa or in the court opinions related to this proceeding however precludes the commission from applying a similar more rigorous standard when faced with challenges to other rates as a matter of discretion if considerations relevant to what is “just and reasonable” make that approach appropriate   because the settlement rates at issue in this proceeding are not contract rates there is no presumption that the mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review should apply  nonetheless the commission determined that it would be appropriate to accept the mobilesierra “public interest” language in part because of the similarities between the settlement rates and contract rates  the commission determined that although these forward capacity auctions will not result in contracts between buyers and sellers they share with freelynegotiated contracts certain marketbased features that tend to assure just and reasonable rates  in particular the commission found that the auctions provide a marketbased mechanism to appropriately value capacity resources based on their location satisfying costcausation principles  the forwardlooking nature of the forward capacity market provides appropriate signals to investors when infrastructure resources are necessary with sufficient lead time to allow that infrastructure to be put into place before reliability is sacrificed  and the locational component of the forward capacity market ensures that the addition of new infrastructure is targeted to where reliability concerns are most critical  in addressing the justness and reasonableness of the settlement the commission determined that acceptance of the settlement including its “public interest” standard of review would promote consumer welfare by balancing the need for rate stability and the interests of the diverse entities who participate in the forward capacity market  the commission found that stability is particularly important in this case which was initiated in part because of the unstable nature of the former installed capacity revenues and the effect that has on generating units particularly those critical to maintaining reliability  in addition as noted above the commission found that the forwardlooking nature of the forward capacity market will provide appropriate signals to investors when new infrastructure resources are necessary with sufficient lead time to allow that infrastructure to be put into place before reliability is sacrificed  the commission also found that the settlement comported with expressed intent of congress regarding this case  the commission’s acceptance of the settlement as a package was consistent with commission precedent  in trailblazer the commission identified four approaches it could use to address a contested settlement  the commission determined that it was appropriate to apply the second trailblazer approach in addressing this settlement  accordingly the commission found that the parties objecting to the settlement agreement would “be in no worse position under the terms of the settlement than if the case were litigated” and that the settlement as a package achieves an overall just and reasonable result within a zone of reasonableness  in particular the commission found that the settlement resolved the issues raised in this proceeding concerning the undercompensation of capacity resources in new england and provided the appropriate market structure to   ensure that generating resources are appropriately compensated based on their location and contribution to system reliability and  provide incentives to attract new infrastructure when and where needed  thus the commission appropriately exercised its discretion under the fpa to accept the settlement including its more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard because the settlement presented an overall just and reasonable result consistent with the requirements of section  of the fpa  moreover the commission found that the settlement might not have been reached without the inclusion of the “public interest” standard of review provided in section c  the commission initiated these proceedings in response to the compensation problems faced by generating resources that are needed for reliability but could not obtain sufficient revenues in the markets to continue operation  if the settlement had not been reached many of the deficiencies within the isone market would have persisted and isone might not have been able to retain the resources needed for reliability  in addition an already protracted litigation involving over  representatives would have continued and would have cause further instability in the isone market thereby thwarting other market enhancements  accepting the application of the mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review to the settlement we recognize will make it more difficult to challenge in future cases the justness and reasonableness of the settlement ie the commission will not act absent a showing of serious public harm  this is not an action that the commission took or takes lightly  in a recent order approving an uncontested settlement the commission directed the settling parties to modify their settlement so as not to impose the “public interest” standard of review on future changes proposed by the commission and nonsettling parties  the commission found that the circumstances of the hios settlement did not rise to the compelling level of those present in devon power so as to warrant binding the commission and nonsettling third parties to a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review  since hios the commission has issued other orders accepting uncontested settlements in which it has directed the settling parties to remove mobilesierra provisions because we found that the circumstances of those settlements did not rise to the compelling level as those present in this proceeding  thus the commission has judged and intends to judge various proposed applications of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard including the mobilesierra “public interest” standard of review on a casebycase basis  the commission will accept a more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard only when the applicant can demonstrate compelling circumstances such as those found in this proceeding that merit such protection from challenges  we will not use our discretion to accept a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard unless we find based on the facts presented that the package offers sufficient benefits to consumers to warrant taking such action  the commission’s assessment as in any statutory just and reasonable analysis must be responsive to the arguments presented and based on the administrative record compiled  moreover even when as in the particular circumstances presented here the commission does decide to exercise its discretion and apply a more stringent standard of review to govern future challenges that action also does not mean that in response to future challenges to a rate the commission will be unable to review the rate    we will respond as necessary to the threat of serious harm to the public interest  the commission has taken such action in the past and retains the ability to do so in the future   the commission orders the requests for rehearing are hereby denied by the commission  commissioner spitzer is not participating  commissioner
