at least one other entity the houstongalveston area council through its hgacbuy affiliate provides cooperative buying opportunities for highpriced capex products but it does so by employing the “piggyback contracting” approach the company is currently exploring opportunities for sublicensing its platform to third parties as a means for more rapidly addressing market segments not currently addressed by the company any such sublicensing agreement would incorporate provisions for royalty payments to the company company description from inception april   accelerated acquisitions v inc was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objectives were to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings on april   the registrant sold  shares of common stock to accelerated venture partners llc for an aggregate investment of  these shares were issued immediately following the incorporation of the company and were “founder’s shares” there were no written or oral agreements between the parties relevant to the purchase of the founder’s shares and the purchaser became the sole shareholder of the company which at the time was a “shell” corporation the registrant sold these shares of common stock under the exemption from registration provided by section  of the securities act on march   richard k aland agreed to acquire  shares of the company’s common stock par value  for a price of  per share and donald kelly agreed to acquire  shares of the common stock par value  for a price of  per share this transaction was consummated on april   at the same time accelerated venture partners llc “avp” agreed to tender  of its  shares of the company’s common stock par value  for cancellation accelerated venture partners llc tendered the shares as a part of a negotiated transaction where it agreed to transfer control of the company to messrs aland and kelly the agreed consideration for the transaction was that avp would retain  of the posttransaction shares issued and outstanding it was also agreed at the time that the company would enter into a consulting services agreement with avp the entire transaction was the subject of an oral agreement between the parties which designated the applicable share amounts and share price and was one integrated transaction there was no specific consideration allocated to any of its elements ie there was no specific consideration for the tender of shares apart from the overall consideration paid by messrs aland and kelly for their concurrent purchase of their interest in the company by letter dated march   avp tendered  shares of its stock to the company for cancellation a copy of this letter is attached as exhibit  messrs aland and kelly subsequently made gifts of  and  shares respectively to an aggregate of nine donees all gifted shares were donated prior to april   all gifts were to members of the respective donor’s family as a part of the donor’s ongoing estate planning the relationships are the following robert and ronald aland are brothers of richard aland lauren morr and erin spalsbury are daughters of richard aland chad kelly and jessica kelly are children of don kelly dominic and wyatt kelly are grandchildren of don kelly nina kelly is the mother of jessica and chad kelly and is don kelly’s exwife following these transactions and the exercise of the avp option mr aland owned  and mr kelly owned  of the company’s  issued and outstanding shares of common stock par value  the interest of accelerated venture partners llc including shares issued on the exercise of the avp option was reduced to approximately  of the total issued and outstanding shares simultaneously with the share purchase timothy neher resigned from the company’s board of directors and messrs aland and kelly were simultaneously appointed to the company’s board of directors such action represented a change of control of the company the company intends to file a certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation with the secretary of state of delaware in order to change its name to “demand pooling inc” following the effective date of this registration statement a draft of the proposed certificate of amendment is attached as exhibit iii on april   the company entered into a licensing agreement “licensing agreement” with demand pooling global services llc “licensor” pursuant to which the company was granted a nontransferrable license for certain territories an exclusive license for north america and a nonexclusive license for all markets outside of north america for certain intellectual property developed by licensor principally comprising a business concept and related technology which has as its core product the aggregation of demand for highticket capital equipment and selected commodities to facilitate cooperative purchases of similar products by a significant number of large endusers the “technology” the technology would also permit and facilitate pooled financing for such purchases in a manner which permits greater financial flexibility for the endusers finally the technology permits and facilitates the disposal of older equipment and commodities by endusers in order to improve the cost recovery on disposal of surplus or dated equipment and commodities the license also provides for the use of a datacenter through a thirdparty provider the only relationship between the company and licensor is that of a licenseelicensor relationship licensor is the developer of the software and the company both markets and operates the platform the license is an exclusive north american license and a nonexclusive worldwide license permitting the licensor to offer the platform to other marketing firms for operation of pools outside of north america the two seniormost managers of both firms are the same richard aland and don kelly the company establishes certain rules for each pool these rules relate primarily to the timing of the pool – when it is opened to buyer participation when buyer participation ends and supplier bidding commences and the time deadline when the suppliers must submit bids typically the latter occurs at  pm central time after which time suppliers can no longer submit bids one second later timed according to the us atomic clock access reverts to the buyers for capturing their respective bids from the supplier no timing is imposed upon the buyers for evaluating their bids and making a determination of whether to award a contract to one or more suppliers or to reject the bids some may award immediately and some may take several months to make a determination but each buyer evaluates its own bids and accepts or rejects them as they have in the past the company provides no examples of invitations for bids “ifbs” purchase agreements or other documentation since every state or local government must reserve the right to employ its own documents which are uploaded onto the company’s platform suppliers must download and acknowledge receipt of those documents before they are allowed to progress to pricing the company imposes no geographic constraints or limitations and the only bidding process that is addressed by the platform is the traditional ‘ competitive sealed bid ’ process which state and local governments either require or with which they are most familiar the company does not plan to offer opportunities for a reverse auction mechanism or for dutch auctions or otherwise the company does not conduct an auction process but rather a very different and distinct process referred to as a “competitive sealed bid” process under the competitive sealed bid process buyers seek pricing from suppliers that are submitted in sealed envelopes or in our case electronically and opened mechanically or electronically by each buyer at bid opening there is no chance as would be the case for an auction for suppliers to submit one or more improved bids the sealed pricing is the best and final bid and no other pricing can be considered the company does not trade commodities a process which as previously explained is very different from the company’s process of providing a platform where state and local governments can post their ifb’s seeking bid pricing for their purchases in fact the company does not buy sell inventory or trade any product slg’s do not hire us contract with us or pay us a fee they simply use our platform to post their requirements through an ifb pursuant to the traditional sealed bid process and we have not been able to identify any entity which is unable to employ our platform except for the rights granted under the license agreement licensor retains all rights title and interest to the technology and any improvements thereto—although the license includes the company’s right to utilize such improvements the term of the license commences the date of execution of the licensing agreement “execution date” and continues for a term of twenty  years ending on the twentieth anniversary of the execution date in addition to other requirements the continuation of the license is conditioned on the company generating net revenues in excess of expenses in the normal course of operations or the funding by the company of a minimum of  for qualifying research development and commercialization expenses in accordance with the following schedule a a minimum of us during the period commencing upon the execution date and ending on the first anniversary of the execution date or b a minimum of us during the period commencing upon the execution date and ending on the second anniversary of the execution date or c a minimum of us during the period commencing upon the execution date and ending on the third anniversary of the execution date notwithstanding the license is not subject to immediate discontinuance despite the fact that the initial milestone net revenues in excess of expenses in the normal course of operations or receive funding of at least  million by one year from april   has passed the three milestones detailed in the license are cumulative and provide that the conditions are satisfied if any one of the three milestones is achieved in other words although milestone  raising  million or generating revenues in the amount of  million has not been met the requirement can be met by achieving milestone  by the second anniversary of the license agreement raising  million or generating  million in revenues and if neither is met then the requirements can be satisfied by achieving milestone  by the end of the third year raising  million or generating  million in revenues neither the company nor any of its advisors or consultants has significant experience in raising funds similar to the  estimated to be required the licensing agreement calls for royalties payable by the company to the licensor of ten percent  of all gross revenues resulting from the use of the technology by the company and twentyfive percent  of all royalties and fees received from third party sublicensees the license is terminated upon the occurrence of events of default specified in the license agreement the company played no role in the development of the technology the business concept behind the technology was developed primarily by richard aland the company founder although he played no role in the actual development of the technology since the company has just begun to apply the technology commercially the company is unable to estimate the commercial value of the technology licensor was created for the purpose of developing and implementing the software application necessary for implementation of mr aland’s vision of how state and local governments could effectively generate largescale savings on the purchase of capital assets and certain commodities motor fuel and water treatment chemicals licensor has been in business since august  and during the time since its commencement of operations through  it developed the software application notwithstanding licensor found that it lacked the capabilities to effectively and successfully market the concept licensor therefore determined to focus solely on software development with a strategy to sell or license the software and to provide support for the software to the best of the company’s knowledge licensor has never been is not currently and has no plans in the future to engage in the demand aggregation pools business dpgs is strictly a software development company which developed the electronic application or platform which is licensed to the company further the company believes that licensor has no intent to engage in a business similar to the company in the united states which the company believes would be in violation of the terms of the license the company believes that licensor has not generated any revenues to date the company investigated a variety of software applications as possible alternatives to the licensed software but did not find any alternative software which it viewed as being as sophisticated scalable and flexible as the software application licensed from licensor the company’s application platform is fully functional in its current state and it is currently conducting its first nonbeta pooled purchase of products for state and local governments the process for operating its aggregation platform involves posting the opening of a pooled purchase of a specific product on its website and allowing buyers to join the pool for  days at the end of this period the pool automatically closes for buyer access and opens to supplier access for capturing all posted ifbs evaluating the ifbs formulating and submitting their bids the period for supplier bidding is also typically  days and requires that all bids must be submitted prior to the end of this period at which time suppliers no longer are permitted access and access returns to the buyers for capturing and evaluating their bids and awarding contracts a determination of award may take as long as  days from the date that the bids are due from suppliers if a supplier is selected as the winning bidder it enters into a contract negotiation period with the buyer and this is conducted independent of the company’s platform if a contract is completed the suppliers are responsible for paying the company’s platform use fee the suppliers of the product pay the fees charged by the company the subject product is motor fuel and the next product pools will be for water treatment chemicals and police and other vehicles the company is currently ascertaining the optimal timing for the launch of pooled purchases for these products the company launched its first nonbeta pool in october  which was followed by a winter motor fuel pool the last week in december  and recently launched its spring motor fuel pool the fall motor fuel pool october  pool was cancelled due to the withdrawal of a buyer with substantial fuel requirements because it could not accept bids solely in an electronic format modifications to the company’s platform now require bids in an electronic format but allow for the buyer to designate that it must also receive written copy of the bid no assurance can be given that one or more awards will be made or revenues will be generated from the award of contracts by buyers the “business concept” which the company is currently marketing to state and local governments is a streamlined ”demand aggregation” or “cooperative purchasing” methodology for acquiring highvalued capital assets and selected commodities motor fuel and water treatment chemicals that comprise a significant component of most state and local government budgets as a means for producing improved pricing volumediscount pricing versus the pricing that would be achievable by individual entities in the volumes each would typically buy the “technology” supporting the business concept is the actual electronic platform that facilitates buyers seeking bid requests in a single time window and in a single location provided they have access to the internet and can login to the company’s website the company’s initial target market is considered highly fragmented consisting of approximately  state and local governments that do not have any natural way of leveraging their collective buying power these state and local governments have common purchase needs are noncompetitive with one another and tend to employ the same sealed bid process for obtaining competitive bids in order to market the benefits of demand aggregation cooperative purchasing to its initial target market customers and potentially to others and to streamline the cooperative buying process the company has licensed a webbased fullyfunctional electronic platform technology developed in its entirety by the licensor to automate various aspects of the business concept the company does not intend to be in the software development business or to commit the resources to creation development or maintenance of software but prefers to focus its attention and resources upon marketing its services to users that may benefit from those services on april   the company entered into a consulting services agreement “consulting services agreement” with avp a company controlled by timothy
