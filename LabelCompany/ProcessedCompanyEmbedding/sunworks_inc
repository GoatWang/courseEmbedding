events talk log in     winding creek rdste roseville ca    i put our inquiry for a newpv system out to bid using energy sage after reviewing  competitive bidsi chose sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged informed and flexible he helped us identify local financing for our system facilitated the loan application and drove rapid installation of our  kw system  weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my  yearold system and install all new racking inverter and panels in  hours i could go on and on with praise for this entire companys commitment availability and professionalism short story  i give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks update  i was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive this process was pretty easy and well done everyone including sales installation and customer service were very professional the only reason for not granting  stars as there was some poor andor miscommunication regarding the permit inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good very happy with the service and feed back for

paperwork permitting and filing  all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by  communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very

notch team to deal with in all facets was this review … useful  funny cool  gail l placerville ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow gail l stop

selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced  others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks  tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house  to top it off the install team was fantastic  they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered  if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it  all the internal components were placed right where i requested  we could not be more pleased  i have recommended sunworks to all my friends  we wholeheartedly recommend them

funny  cool  p h lincoln ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow p h stop following p h  after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company   we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville  it was excellent   after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project   the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project   installation was within the same week   the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind   the inspection was done the next day and we were online  a sunwork employee was here for the inspectionwe were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected   of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased   our meter is running backwardsthe sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent  their presentation was very professional and easy to understandaspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing               as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name  they are all top in their fieldwe had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company   therefore less cost   also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decisionthe situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control   billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels   however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences viewsin closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation was this

they left our home neat and clean  i highly recommend using them  now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse was this review … useful  funny  cool  becca k auburn ca  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow becca k stop following becca k  after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plantsafter installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never respondedi have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plantalso a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company

from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with  she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product  once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly  there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install  because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county  this is where the only hiccup occurred  as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while  i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan  she referred me to customer service  i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away  from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge  now we are enjoying our new solar systemi highly

services write a review events talk log in     winding creek rdste roseville ca    i put our inquiry for a newpv system out to bid using energy sage after reviewing  competitive bidsi chose sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged informed and flexible he helped us identify local financing for our system facilitated the loan application and drove rapid installation of our  kw system  weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my  yearold system and install all new racking inverter and panels in  hours i could go on and on with praise for this entire companys commitment availability and professionalism short story  i give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks update  i was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive this process was pretty easy and well done everyone including sales installation and customer service were very professional the only reason for not granting  stars as there was some poor andor miscommunication regarding the permit inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions sunworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details solar installation edit

for a newpv system out to bid using energy sage after reviewing  competitive bidsi chose sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged informed and flexible he helped us identify local financing for our system facilitated the loan application and drove rapid installation of our  kw system  weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my  yearold system and install all new racking inverter and panels in  hours i could go on and on with praise for this entire companys commitment availability and professionalism short story  i give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks update  i was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive this process was pretty easy and well done everyone including sales installation and customer service were very professional the only reason for not granting  stars as there was some poor andor miscommunication regarding the permit inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity

contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never respondedi have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plantalso a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it

write a review events talk log in     winding creek rdste roseville ca    i put our inquiry for a newpv system out to bid using energy sage after reviewing  competitive bidsi chose sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged informed and flexible he helped us identify local financing for our system facilitated the loan application and drove rapid installation of our  kw system  weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my  yearold system and install all new racking inverter and panels in  hours i could go on and on with praise for this entire companys commitment availability and professionalism short story  i give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive my wife and i had spent a couple of years talking with different companies to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar at first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received and had given up looking at solar but with the continuing higher bills we were paying to pge we decided to reevaluate going solar about this same time we heard an ad for sunworks solar on our local radio station we scheduled an appointment with sunworks and they explained everything from what our needs were by comparing our yearly usage to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it we were very happy with their proposal the installation was neat and professional and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since april of  sure you give up one bill for another but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was and the system will be paid for in a few years i would recommend going with sunworks solar to my friends wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse we worked with jose to get our solar completed from start to finish everything was explained clearly and the install was completed without any problems we are very happy with the service from sunworks and love not having an electricity bill wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we interviewed  different solar companies and decided to go with sunworks due to the high quality equipment and the comprehensive  year warranty within a few days of us signing the contract the engineer came out to do the site inspection we had drawings to approve within a week and two weeks later the crew was out installing the system the crew was very professional and friendly they were very careful to not damage anything around the house and did a beautiful job routing the conduit so that it was not too noticeable i have worked with contractors and construction my whole life and this team was one of the most impressive i have ever encountered would highly recommend them i would also like to extend my gratitude and pleasure in dealing with all areas of the sunworks team this includes tony in sales the installation team the whole team was prompt and professional the office clerical and vince in technical support sunworks has delivered on every and all aspects of work and has shown true professionalism in all areas i found it hard to believe that sunworks did not try to take advantage of me or attempt to insult my integrity in this day and age to find a local company that has the most competitive pricing as well as covering the cost of material and installation with no down payment until the project is complete is just remarkable in our geographic location our homeowners association is not the easiest to comply with and there were no hickups along the way we are producing power and our first electric pge bill was  during stormy weather fantastic is the only word i can use to describe sunworks i would like this email to be forwarded to the individuals that were involved with our solar system as well as the sunworks management team and owners to say that i am a satisfied customer is truly an understatement you guys are great and i will forward this email to yelp and the bbb better business buearu this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions we

is being included in our financing will update this review after install excellent experience from beginning to end the communication with my sales rep trever mickelson exceeded my expectations the installation was on time and accommodated my adjustment requests when inspected the words from the inspector were one of the cleanest solar installs ive ever seen ive referred them to several friends and family all of who have been pleased with their experience happy customer  sunworks is a great solar company they are honest responsive offer great products offer a solid  year warranty and offer the best value of any solar company i had quote you must have them quote your solar job or else you will be leaving thousands of dollars on the table sunworks was a great experience for our family we decided to go with them after comparing them with several competitors and i have to say their quote was far more reasonable than at least one of their top competitors so be sure to do your due diligence from the sales process all the way to the team of experienced install technicians who installed my  kilowatt system in just a few hours we thought the team was extremely knowledgeable and professional its been six months since our install and ive been tracking the data and comparing it to the roi estimates from their sales team somewhat to my surprise since i know how sales teams operate their estimates were very ontarget highly recommended sunworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details

friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow p h stop following p h  after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company   we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville  it was excellent   after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project   the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project   installation was within the same week   the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind   the inspection was done the next day and we were online  a sunwork employee was here for the inspectionwe were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected   of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased   our meter is running backwardsthe sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent  their presentation was very professional and easy to understandaspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing               as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name  they are all top in their fieldwe had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company   therefore less cost   also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decisionthe situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control   billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels   however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences viewsin closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation was this review … useful  funny  cool  bill b

work with  she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product  once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly  there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install  because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county  this is where the only hiccup occurred  as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while  i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan  she referred me to customer service  i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away  from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge  now we are enjoying our new solar systemi highly recommend this company  they take good care of their customers do great work

the most competitive pricing as well as covering the cost of material and installation with no down payment until the project is complete is just remarkable in our geographic location our homeowners

winding creek rdste roseville ca    vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list update  i was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on so here is the deal when a sales person comes out to your house and gives you a price and also offers different financing solutions you should be able to take them at their word so when their sales person gave us the price and financing numbers i called back a couple days later and told the sales person that i was ready to do the deal instantly he told me that the financing would not work because work we would not be borrowing enough didnt he know that when he told us about it i gave him another chance because he said he had other financing things we could do i told him that the monthly cost better not go up or we would not do the deal the next day i received an email with the new terms while the monthly cost went down it went from a  year note to a  year note and the price went up  because we had fees to pay for now so to all you sales people out there if you want to sell the job dont do the old bait and switch thing the initial process went fairly smooth sunworks was vary quick to respond to my questions and complete the installation the installation was completed in a day the crew was friendly and competent unfortunately they did leave a mess of insulation in my home that had fallen from the attic thats unfortunately when the customer service stopped i have been attempting to nail down my inspection and enrolment in the net metering program for over  weeks now i kept getting the same story about operations calling me back with all my answers from scott feuerherm the responses were a little slow at first now he appears to stop responding all together its been  days since i last made contact and have had no response at this point i am happy to return the k system and deal with someone who gives a crap about completing the contract just because they have received a check doesnt mean the job is complete get your act together sunworks after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i have a no soliciting sign next to my front door they still rang my doorbell and pushed a flyer through the crack around the door a company that doesnt respect a homeowners right to not be bombarded at home will never get my business and i have already told my friends will never use this company or give a referral to them i received a knock on my door one evening to see if i was interested in solar i am so i scheduled an appointment with the salesman at my door for him to come give me an estimate they called me to reschedule that appointment because they had double booked i understand so i rescheduled they they called me again to reschedule that appointment because they had something else come up obviously i wasnt a priority so i didnt reschedule again about  months later i received a call from a manager who was sorry that it previously didnt work out he asked if i would allow them to come back out and give me an offer i couldnt refuse i was hesitant but gave them another opportunity well they canceled that appointment the day before they were supposed to be there customer service is clearly not their strong suit seems silly to review a company that ive never done business with but theyve gone out of their way to waste my time sunworks solar delivers a bad customer service their management is greedy  unprofessional my friends also shared with me their unpleasant experience while trying to buy a solar system for their home from sunworks being older folks they dont care to leave a negative feedback online they just sent sunworks team their way  found a better company to buy a solar system from i got quotes from a number of solar companies before making a choice  this wasnt the company i chose or can recommend anyone to deal with their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this process was pretty easy and well done everyone including sales installation and customer service were very professional the only reason for not granting  stars as there was some poor andor miscommunication regarding the permit inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great i put our inquiry for a newpv system out to bid using energy sage after reviewing  competitive bidsi chose sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged informed and flexible he helped us identify local financing for our system facilitated the loan application and drove rapid installation of our  kw system  weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my  yearold system and install all new racking inverter and panels in  hours i could go on and on with praise for this entire companys commitment availability and professionalism short story  i give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive my wife and i had spent a couple of years talking with different companies to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar at first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received and had given up looking at solar but with the continuing higher bills we were paying to pge we decided to reevaluate going solar about this same time we heard an ad for sunworks solar on our local radio station we scheduled an appointment with sunworks and they explained everything from what our needs were by comparing our yearly usage to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it we were very happy with their proposal the installation was neat and professional and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since april of  sure you give up one bill for another but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was and the system will be paid for in a few years i would recommend going with sunworks solar to my friends wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse we worked with jose to get our solar completed from start to finish everything was explained clearly and the install was completed without any problems we are very happy with the service from sunworks and love not having an electricity bill wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone sunworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a

sunworks solar on our local radio station we scheduled an appointment with sunworks and they explained everything from what our needs were by comparing our yearly usage to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it we were very happy with their proposal the installation was neat and professional and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since april of  sure you give up

as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive this process was pretty easy and well done

electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge

did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never respondedi have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the

about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never respondedi have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at

placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions sunworks claimed this

roseville  it was excellent   after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project   the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project   installation was within the same week   the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind   the inspection was done the next day and we were online  a sunwork employee was here for the inspectionwe were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected   of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased   our meter is running backwardsthe sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent  their presentation was very professional and easy to understandaspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing               as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name  they are all top in their fieldwe had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company   therefore less cost   also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decisionthe situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control   billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels   however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as

ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plantsafter installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never respondedi have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plantalso a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it

with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions sunworks claimed this business has been claimed

consider selecting this company to install a pv system for you sunworks have installed a  panel solar roof in early december  the ytd pge savings have met the original agreement projections and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly billings from pge etc the original installation was fantastic and we are very grateful to emil the sunworks president for his efforts to assure a great customer experience for our family home here in rocklin we would like a big shout out to aspen the doo at sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction very pleasant and transparentkeep rockin sunworks update  i was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down as i said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing options which i told him id need financing months later as i have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it i was only given one financing option which i was told id need my house to not be in a trust and if it was id have to get a lawyer and switch it not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me ive decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as i save my money salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion kris never responded to my emailed questions over  days ago not good service and i havent even had any work done yet not a good sign ill be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use vultures i went to a home show two days ago i am very interested in solar but i am a teacher and im not available to do a project until this summer i explained this to them at the booth and they wrote down that i wouldnt be able to do this until june i got a call from this company today asking me if i wanted to move up the date seriously i spoke to many solar companies at this home show the others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline you just helped me cross one off of my list purchased our solar panels from mike del vecchio who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of  years that covers everything he even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect the install crew showed up  minutes early and finished  hours early they were all super nice guys who were prompt courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house i live in an area with hoa and sunworks took care of all the paperwork permitting and filing all we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and smud came by communication throughout the project was top notch and it started at the very beginning i highly recommend sunworks if you are looking to get into solar they have the best warranty the best panels half the amount required for the same output that others supply and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets great service from start to finish i met with several companies  sunworks offered competitive pricing a great warranty and installed in under three weeks communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises on the day of our install the workers arrived on time at a did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing got the team working almost immediately did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment had the site cleaned and were done by p impressive this process was pretty easy and well done everyone including sales installation and customer service were very professional the only reason for not granting  stars as there was some poor andor miscommunication regarding the permit inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay wow fantastic purchase we leased our system in our old house but this time we purchased as the costs would be much better in the long run we selected sunworks because they were local used highest quality americanmade panels were able to carefully listen to our needs and were very reasonably priced others are cheaper but they use lower quality parts no thanks tino laconte in the sunworks design center in rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process especially when we had hiccups in the financing we had just bought the house to top it off the install team was fantastic they also carefully listened to my needs as i wanted the system to be nearly invisible they delivered if i dont tell my friends i have a solar system they wouldnt even see it all the internal components were placed right where i requested we could not be more pleased i have recommended sunworks to all my friends we wholeheartedly recommend them now we have electricity from the sun and not from country that doesnt like us some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil ask for tino that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process this company is absolutely fantastic i have nothing but the best things to say about them they use the best products they have been in business much longer than their competitors and their warranty is second to no one i was so impressed with the company i asked if they had any jobs available unfortunately i had to cancel at the last minute due to a family crisis up until this point i was extremely impressed with everything i would highly recommend calling the sales rep tino he was awesome this company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices i signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch we opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the  gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion hindsight being what it is im glad we didnt move forward with them because if they cant keep that easy promise who knows what else they will fail on after reading the reviews i cannot believe we are talking about the same company we were given a presentation at the showroom in roseville it was excellent after going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project the cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project installation was within the same week the crew from sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasnt any debris left behind the inspection was done the next day and we were online a sunwork employee was here for the inspection we were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email pge gave us the pto permit to operate quicker then expected of course we havent received our first pge billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased our meter is running backwards the sales team of tino and jose by blue oaks were excellent their presentation was very professional and easy to understand aspen in the winding creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing as a team from the sales people to operations to their vice president of sales and marketing who i am sorry to say i cant remember his name they are all top in their field we had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company therefore less cost also sunworks panels are made in america which was a factor in our decision the situation at sun city lincoln hills was not in sunworks control billy casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels however it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views in closing i have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation we just received notice for pge that we could turn on our system we had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing sunworks for us it was absolutely the write decision from the beginning brent baker and shirley montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best from there the communications from yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing the installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean i highly recommend using them now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse after meeting with numerous solar installers we ultimately chose sunworks we were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless i was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract rather than the weeks we were told installation took two days due to our steep roof the installers were mostly polite but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants after installation we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process we were never contacted my husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later then we received the bill i contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection and why we have not been contacted to sign the required pge paperwork or to learn about monitoring the woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet i did so by the next day we never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt my husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt again she never responded i have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit i emailed weeks ago at this point we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company we do however have a ruined blueberry plant also a coworker referred this company to us and despite the fact that we mentioned it several times she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus this company clearly has a problem with follow through once theyve received your money i went with the local solar installer was very satisfied with the sales rep tony office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific did exactly what was promised roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in roseville got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us we went with  solar panels and the credits in march and april paid our garbage water and sewer bill too have had the system installed since september no issues i would highly recommend sunworks have referred  friends since they had the same experience with sunworks from the first meeting with sherridan i knew this company would be great to work with she had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product once the design team had a layout ready the install happened quickly there was a small change made at regarding panel placement but it didnt delay the install because of the change they had to submit the new plans to the county this is where the only hiccup occurred as is typical with government the county sat on the new plans for a while i hadnt heard anything for a while so i contacted sherridan she referred me to customer service i spoke with adriana who got to the cause of the delay right away from there it was about a week and we were connected to pge now we are enjoying our new solar system i highly recommend this company they take good care of their customers do great work and sell a great product we were referred to sunworks from a friend who just had solar installed havent gotten it installed yet but met with the sales rep tonight jose alvarez and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty love how quickly we were able to get an appointment and that they work late hours we have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be love the fact that we will get  for any body we refer and love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar also love that a new roof is being included in our financing will update this review after install their price is not low but willing to match to certain degree initial pricing was ok from trever but the later communication is an issue from karinaadriana they do not respond in emails and youll have to call to catch them they said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and i have not heard a thing in passed  days even with couple email inquiries this review is for the south bay area team san jose i have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies i was so tired of all the run around with sales departments i decided to go a slightly different route like lots of people i wanted the best overall deal i decided to go with an energy broker i used your energy ally i did my deal through them they then shop around for your needs and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling with that said i just finished with my solar installation these guys were fast friendly and on time i purchased a  kw system not a lease within a week after giving them my deposit through my energy broker i had all the permits in place product ordered and a schedule for the installation due to the volume of people getting solar it was scheduled for a month away a week later i got a call from the main office telling me of a cancellation asking if i would like to be scheduled  weeks earlier i jumped at the opportunity they told us  days to install the st day they had done more than   of the work by noon they came back the following day and had it finished within a couple of hours pge inspected  days later for final approval i now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence one last item the installation looks beautiful the attention to the details shows in the work the roof panels the inverter installation the conduit runs in the attic everything is looks and functions great wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing sunworks when we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to  other companies before ultimately choosing to go with sunworks sunworks bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well we live in a community with an hoa and sunworks handled the permitting for the hoa and the city the installation crew were professional and quick the data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved we got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the smud rebate quickly i have since called them twice once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful i would recommend them to anyone had sun works install my system in stockton a few months agogot the e panel and didnt need that many to get the power i needes the install was only  hours a clean install and now i can monitor the power i make the low profile panels look good
