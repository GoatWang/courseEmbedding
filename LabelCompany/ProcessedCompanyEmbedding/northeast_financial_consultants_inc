independence     northeastern financial consultants inc all rights reserved mhpphotoscom created and supported website financial life planning home what we do our services client profiles life planning our philosophy our promise our team client center resources contact us financial life planning feeonly planner northeastern financial consultants incis a feeonly financial planning firm committed to assisting client to reach their financial goals feeonly planners like us are compensated solely by fees paid by their clients and do not accept commissions or compensation from any other source as feeonly planners we believe there is a significant conflict of interest if an advisor stands to gain financially from the purchase of any investment or insurance product he or she recommends to the client what is it feeonly investment management is the newest and most attractive way to pay for professional money management and is the type of arrangement recommended by many leading financial writers and experts  rather than paying sales commissions for brokers to sell you products you pay instead a reasonable annual fee based on your account value the feeonly advisor does not charge commissions heshe is interested in growing your account and providing longterm service why is it better northeastern financial consultants inccharges a reasonable quarterly management fee based on the value of your account the main difference between a stockbroker and us is that they make a living by charging their clients commissions therefore the more the charge the more money they make stockbrokers often charge    per trade on stocks and as much as  on mutual funds stockbrokers may also have hidden charges such as b fees or surrender fees on mutual funds surrender fees and bloated internal expenses on annuities and heavy markups on products like unit trusts or bonds on the other hand as a feeonly advisor our compensation is a flat percentage of your account value we do not earn any money from commissions trailers or markups we earn money only if your account grows or if we gain new clients feeonly vs feebased do not be confused or misled  feeonly is definitely not the same as feebased feebased is a confusing term for a compensation structure that used to be called feeplus commission feebased usually means that you pay for a plan or other advice and then pay to buy investments with commissions or markups that go to the advisor this can be worse than the straight commission arrangement because you may pay twice without realizing it feeonly is what leading financial writers often recommend it is safer more objective and without the drag of commissions it has every reason to have performance as good or better than the feebased or commission approaches standard payments for services there are three basic ways you can pay for investment help by the hour by a set fee or by commissions specific advisory services such as evaluating your overall financial needs developing a comprehensive financial plan or developing an asset allocation plan are billed on a flat fee basis feeonly advisors charge a set fee for services rendered and a fee usually  or less based on a percentage of the assets under management a commissioned advisor gets paid on a per transaction basis by the companies whose products he or she sells for ongoing management the type of payment arrangement you have is important because of the issue of sales pressure if an investment advisor is compensated solely by commissions or is affiliated with a firm that offers only it’s own proprietary investments you’ll want to know the implications of this arrangement and get assurances that this will not influence decisions made for your account back to list  financial life

enterprise systems management information assurance network engineering and systems development and integration    cowen and company analysts commented ncit offers an attractive riskreward profile as its peerlow valuation x evebitda   fbr  co analysts commented we take a neutral perspective on nci shares for the time being although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government it landscape ceo paul dillahay was appointed in october  and we believe he is taking steps to increase nci’s ability to capture new business given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable that being said we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the peo soldier contract that we estimate accounted for  of revenue in —and there may be a nearterm sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller the company does have significant capabilities in agile software development and we believe management’s approach is inspired there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future but for the time being we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable  who are some of ncis key competitors some companies that are
