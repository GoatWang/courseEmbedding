engineers have left one of its most secretive ai projects to form a stealth startup groq founders previously helped create googles tensor processing unit venture capitalist chamath palihapitiya led a  million investment in the startup the project is in secretive stealth mode ari levy  levynews thursday  apr    pm etcnbccom shares show chapters several google engineers have left its secretive ai program to form a secretive startup    friday  apr    am et   google has slowly been pulling back the curtain on homegrown silicon that could define the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence some key creators of that project — the tensor processing unit or tpu — recently left to team up with chamath palihapitiya one of silicon valleys most prominent and outspoken young venture investors on a stealth startup groq inc is the name of the company at least for the time being there are no promotional materials or website all that exists online are a couple sec filings from october and december showing that the company raised  million and an incorporation filing in the state of delaware on sept  were really excited about groq palihapitiya wrote in an email its too early to talk specifics but we think what theyre building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing groq names three principals in the sec documents jonathan ross who helped invent the tpu douglas wightman an entrepreneur and former engineer at the google x moonshot factory and palihapitiya founder of investment firm social capital the listed address is social capitals headquarters palihapitiya told cnbc last month that he invested in a team of exgooglers who helped build the chip which he first heard about on an earnings call  ½ years ago they randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for ai and i thought what is going on here why is google competing with intel palihapitiya said in an interview on squawk box show chapters chamath palihapitiya i spent ½ years trying to find the people who made googles ai chip    thursday  mar    am et   the company which we now know is groq now has eight of the first  people from the tpu team building a nextgeneration chip he said all startups are hard but a new chip company is something most venture capitalists wont touch the research and development costs required to get a working prototype can be exorbitant then theres manufacturing and the herculean challenge of finding device makers to take a chance on unproven technology also the incumbents — intel qualcomm and nvidia — are massive and google apple and amazon are developing their own silicon as crazy as it may be palihapitiya is taking the plunge this next wave of chip innovation can empower companies like facebook and amazon tesla the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before he said in last months interview ross linkedin page says he left google in september and is currently gainfully unemployed according to wightmans profile he left the same month but doesnt say where he went wightman confirmed the funding in an email and said were still heads down right now launching the tpu google made its first public pronouncement about the tpu in may with a blog post just ahead of the companys annual developers conference norm jouppi one of the project heads said google had been using the technology internally for over a year for things like improving the relevance of search results and the accuracy of its maps its also part of googles cloud platform in a product called tensorflow that lets other companies run machine learning workloads in googles data centers the essence of tpus is the ability to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon machine learning or the training of computers to get smarter as data sets increase and without the need for human interference is weaving its way into all types of consumer and business apps at googles scale that work is too taxing for todays processors palihapitiya said at a conference in january that the main reason hes bullish on google as an investment is because theyre an order of magnitude ahead of everyone else hes not the only investor paying attention denny fish a portfolio manager who focuses on technology at janus said google is doing everything it can to ensure maximum performance and efficiency to handle the heft of machine learning workloads source google google’s tensor processing unit or tpu theyve said if were going to do this and win we need the most efficient way using the least amount of power he said they feel like theyve cracked the code earlier this month google provided its first real update on tpus in a 7page report titled indatacenter performance analysis of a tensor processing unit in a summary blog post jouppi wrote that ai workloads using tpus are running  to  times faster than contemporary processors while efficiency is  to  times better the study compared tpus to chips from intel and nvidia ross was one of 7 authors of the report hes also listed in the paper as an inventor on four patents all tied to neural networks processors and computation which you can think of as computing systems designed to mimic the brain ross linkedin page says he started the tpu with one other engineer as part of a  percent project the perk that lets google employees spend onefifth of their time working on a side project they think will benefit the company from  to  he worked as a google hardware engineer in madison wisconsin home to one of the principal hotbeds of tpu development wightman cofounded four companies before his google days at google x he worked on futuristic projects like loon a network of balloons thats setting
