in this report pnr refers to the operator of the hugoton royalty properties conocophillips refers to the operator of the san juan basin royalty properties other than the portion of such properties located in colorado and bp refers to the operator of the colorado san juan basin royalty properties unless otherwise indicated         effective october   the bank of new york mellon trust company na the trustee succeeded jpmorgan chase bank na as trustee of the trust jpmorgan chase bank na is the successor by mergers to the original name of the trustee texas commerce bank national association the terms of the mesa royalty trust indenture the trust indenture provide among other things that         a   the trust cannot engage in any business or investment activity or purchase any assets         b   the royalty can be sold in part or in total for cash upon approval by the unitholders         c   the trustee can establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the trust and can pledge assets of the trust to secure payment of the borrowings              d   the trustee will make cash distributions to the unitholders in january april july and october each year as discussed more fully in note          e   the trust will terminate upon the first to occur of the following events i at such time as the trusts royalty income for two successive years is less than  per year or ii a vote by the unitholders in favor of termination upon termination of the trust the trustee will sell for cash all the assets held in the trust estate and make a final distribution to unitholders of any funds remaining after all trust liabilities have been satisfied and         f    pnr conocophillips and bp collectively the working interest owners will reimburse the trust for   and  respectively for general and administrative expenses of the trust note —basis of presentation         the accompanying unaudited financial information has been prepared by the trustee in accordance with the instructions to form q the preparation of the financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the trustee believes such information includes all the disclosures necessary to make the information presented not misleading the information furnished reflects all adjustments which are in the opinion of the trustee necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented the financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the trusts annual report on form k for the year ended december   the trust considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents subsequent events were evaluated through the issuance date of the financial statements         in accordance with the conveyance the working interest owners are obligated to calculate and pay the trust each month an amount equal to  of the net proceeds as defined in the conveyance attributable to the month in  the trust indenture was amended and the trust conveyed to an affiliate of mesa petroleum co  of the original royalty such transfer the  assignment the effect of the  assignment was an overall reduction of approximately  in the size of the trust as a result the trust is now entitled to receive  of  of the net proceeds attributable to each month         the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis         a   royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the working interest owners to the trustee for such month rather than either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the working interest owners for such month or the amount subsequently determined to be the trusts proportionate share of the net proceeds for such month         b   interest income interest receivable and distributions payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on shortterm investments from the financial statement date through the next date of distribution         c   trust general and administrative expenses net of reimbursements are recorded in the month they are included in the calculation of the monthly distribution amount              d   amortization of the royalty is computed on a unitofproduction basis and is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income and         e   distributions payable are determined on a monthly basis and are payable to unitholders of record as of the last business day of each month or such later date as the trustee determines is required to comply with applicable law or stock exchange requirements however cash distributions are made quarterly in january april july and october and include interest earned from the monthly record dates to the date of distribution         this basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a month are based on net cash receipts for such month however these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because under such principles royalty income for a month would be based on net proceeds from production for such month without regard to when calculated or received general and administrative expenses would be recorded in the month they accrue and interest income for a month would be calculated only through the end of such month note —legal proceedings         there are no pending legal proceedings to which the trust is a named party the trustee has been advised by pnr conocophillips and bp amoco that it is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business for certain matters that include the royalty properties while each of the working interest owners has advised the trustee that it does not currently believe any of the pending litigation will have a material adverse effect net to the trust in the event such matters were adjudicated or settled in a material amount and charges were made against royalty income such charges could have a material impact of future royalty income note —income tax matters         in a technical advice memorandum dated february   the irs advised the dallas district director that the trust is classifiable as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation as a grantor trust the trust incurs no federal income tax liability and each unitholder is subject to tax on the unitholders pro rata share of the income and expense of the trust as if the unitholder were the direct owner of a pro rata share of the trusts assets in addition there is no state tax liability for the period         the trustee assumes that some trust units are held by a middleman as such term is broadly defined in us treasury regulations and includes custodians nominees certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name therefore the trustee considers the trust to be a nonmortgage widely held fixed investment trust whfit for us federal income tax purposes bank of new york mellon trust company na  congress avenue austin texas  telephone number  is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable us treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a whfit note —excess production costs         excess production costs result when costs charges and expenses attributable to a working interest property exceed the revenue received from the sale of oil gas and other hydrocarbons produced from        such property excess production costs related to the san juan basin—colorado properties were approximately  as of march   and  as of december   the excess production costs must be recovered by the working interest owners before any distribution of royalty income from the properties will be made to the trust note —tax assessment         pnr has advised the trustee that it received a proposed assessment from the kansas department of revenue on september   for additional tax penalty and interest of approximately  million resulting primarily from the settlement of the lawsuit john steven alford and robert larrabee individually and on behalf of a plaintiff class v pioneer natural resources usa inc in early  the portion of the tax assessment net to the trust is approximately  which could adversely affect trust distributions pnr has submitted a written response objecting to the proposed assessment on march   the kansas department of revenue issued a final assessment which included additional interest and penalties increasing the amount assessed to approximately  million the portion of the tax assessment net to the trust is approximately  which could adverserly affect trust distributions pnr intends to challenge the march   final assessment through the administrative process provided for under kansas law no assurance can be made that any objections or disputed items raised by pnr will be successful         pnr has also advised the trustee that it is preparing to file for a severance tax refund with the state of kansas for approximately  million the estimated share of the refund due the trust is approximately  as of april   pnr has filed for approximately  million of severance tax refunds of which the trust share is approximately  there can be no assurance that the state will agree to pnrs position      item      managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations         the following review of the trusts financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto the discussion of net production attributable to the hugoton and san juan properties represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes see note  to the financial statements in the trusts annual report on form k for the year ended december   any discussion of actual production volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the properties in which the trust has an overriding royalty interest         the trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to  converting the royalties to cash either by retaining them and collecting the proceeds of production until production has ceased or the royalties are otherwise terminated or by selling or otherwise disposing of the royalties and  distributing such cash net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the trust to the unitholders the trust has no sources of liquidity or capital resources other than the revenues if any attributable to the royalties and interest
