a big deal for climate change “give me a place to stand and i shall move the world” – archimedes c bctoday we are excited to be a part of opower’s ipo—an amazing milestone for founders dan yates and alex laskey who shared the vision that a software company using big data and behavioral science could one day affect climate change we first met dan and alex six years ago when opower was piloting a new kind of energy efficiency program to just a few thousand homes with a small utility in sacramento california  the program had a simple hypothesis  by giving people personalized datadriven insights about their energy consumption you could help them save energy inspired by dan and alex’s enthusiasm and belief that opower would one day become pervasive in the global utility industry nea led the their first round of institutional venture capital when the company had just  employeessince  my partner harry weller and i have had the privilege of being a part of opower’s journey and watching dan and alex’s dream become a reality  opower today reaches over  million households and businesses through  utilities in eight countries analyzing over  billion meter reads a year  their ipo milestone today will enable the company to continue to deploy its products around the world working hand in hand with some of the largest customers in the  trillion utility industry the utility industry has historically underinvested in technologies such as crm and consumer engagement a company like opower could not have been imagined just  years ago  in recent years the industry has changed and utilities have come under increasing regulatory and environmental pressure to build fewer power plants find cleaner sources of fuel and compete with new entrants like solar installers  around the world utilities are embracing opower to leverage advanced behavioral science cloud computing and “big data” analytics to give us all a rich understanding of our energy use  the results are inspiring – opower provides utilities with a reliable lowcost alternative to building more power plants saves money for consumers on energy bills and prevents tons of wasteful carbon emissions every year opower was far from an overnight success and required amazing passion and persistence to overcome the odds  the company’s remarkable journey can be attributed to two incredible entrepreneurs who have largely defied and debunked conventional wisdomfirst in an industry where billions of dollars are invested annually in rd to supply the world with clean cheap renewable energy opower has always focused on transforming consumer demand through software in doing so they have become one of the largest “virtual power plants” in the world generating nearly half the energy of the hoover dam the founders have always been contrarian thinkers and were never ones to follow a herd second rather than attempt to disrupt the status quo dan and alex made the hard decision early on to work side by side with utilities state regulators and governments around the world educating them on the benefits of embracing modern solutions like cloud computing and behavioral science  their early investment in government relations ultimately proved that regulators can and do play an important role in accelerating not impeding the adoption of new technology      finally opower has from the very first day been a “double bottom line” company one whose economic and environmental results were aligned  revenue generated by opower results in energy savings for the planet and ultimately reduces use of fossil fuel  the unique alignment of these incentives is extremely hard to find in any company let alone one that is publicly traded congratulations to dan alex and the opower team  you have proven that “big data” is a big deal in the fight against climate change and have inspired us all to do our own small part elevator pitch jon sakoda on why nea is sticking to seed investing trends be damned  siliconbeat even though many vc firms are backing away from seed investing nea is just getting started  my interview with silicon beat… vc in  nea’s jon sakoda on venture firms facing new competition the vc industry faces a multifront war  how will we respond  my interview with the wsj… swiftype making site search simple as the web moves to mobile we are excited to announce our series a investment in swiftype a rapidly growing “search as a service” platform that makes it possible for any website or mobile application to add modern search to their product in less than a minute  as an early seed investor we have had the privilege of watching swiftype grow from a proof of concept to a service that is today used by over  customers including some of the largest ecommerce media and technology companies in the world  this tremendous growth has largely been accomplished through word of mouth adoption and remarkably without any sales or marketing investment  in the past  months since launching their service swiftype has quietly become the largest search engine you’ve never heard of     swiftype’s rapid adoption can be attributed to three major factors  first “search” has always been one of the hardest technical problems for engineering teams to solve  with the exception of google amazon and a handful of web giants most companies struggle to maintain a high quality search experience because it requires large engineering teams and heavy resource investment  swiftype makes search unbelievably simple by integrating into any application with just a few lines of javascript and gives businesses unparalleled control over their search results  second because consumers are rapidly moving to mobile devices as their primary mode of consumption search is becoming critical for user engagement  users don’t have the luxury of using rich and complex navigation on a small screen making search a more important feature for application developers  finally google which has long been synonymous with search has been quietly exiting the “search as a service” market by shutting down products like google commerce search  google is has made it very clear that they are interested in making search great for google’s bottom line but not necessarily for anyone else for several years nea has been investing in the rapidly growing area of cloud services that simplify very complex tasks for technical users such as braintree for payments recently acquired by ebay for  million and cloudflare for web security and performance  as these companies have captured the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of businesses they have achieved significant competitive advantage through network effects scale and data that have made them as formidable and knowledgeable as the largest tech companies in the world in their unique area of expertise  swiftype today is already seeing more than  million search queries a month and we believe their focus will enable them to provide the very best “search as a service” for any website or mobile application as their platform expands over time we are excited to work with matt riley and quin hoxie the founders of swiftype who long ago asked why website search was inaccurate inflexible and expensive to implement  with swiftype luckily we no longer have to search for an answer  seeing the future when video clouds collide… we are excited to be a part of today’s  million financing in blue jeans network the world’s fastest growing cloudbased video conferencing service  nea invested in blue jeans over  years ago and has had the privilege of watching the service grow from a proofofconcept to a disruptive product now serving over  customers and  million participants  the premise behind blue jeans is very simple – make video conferencing as pervasive and easy to use as audio conferencing by providing a service that works from any device with a twoway camera across cisco and polycom room systems microsoft google and skype clients and every browser and mobile phone  by providing interoperability across these services blue jeans has become the missing link in realtime collaboration and one of the fastest growing softwareasaservice companies in our portfolio blue jeans is an incredibly simple service to use and describe but it is an extremely complex technical solution that was not possible or feasible just  years ago  first high quality video bridging has traditionally been done through special purpose expensive processors and it is only recently that multicore processors have reached a price point for video interoperability to be performed on commodity hardware  second significant advancements in h compression have made it easier for high quality video to be streamed through low bandwidth connections  finally pervasive cloud infrastructure has made it possible to scale up to support millions of users overnight a requirement to meet the demands of the largest customers around the world  the convergence of these technology trends has made it possible to launch blue jeans and to unlock the true potential of video in the workforce it is truly a privilege to work with the founders of blue jeans krish and alagu who have realized the vision of video as a “dialtone” service that would connect the world around us  today we can see this vision coming to life transforming many industries that have adopted their service  we see universities using blue jeans to turn physical lecture halls into virtual classrooms that can bridge in students from multiple countries  we see doctors using blue jeans to connect medical experts into emergency procedures enabling patients to get the best care even in remote locations  and in a workforce that is increasingly geographically dispersed we see millions of people using blue jeans to see their customers and colleagues and to discover what is possible with pervasive video  want to see the future  just try wwwbluejeanscom signal or noise nea’s experience with signaling risk in seed investing this post is a followup to my “ask a vc” interview with leena rao at techcrunch who posed the question “why does a  billion fund make seed investments”  nea is one of the largest vc firms by assets under management and has quietly become one of the most active seed investors in the industry launching a seed program was controversial both within the firm and throughout the seed investment community  the primary concern was “signaling risk” or the notion that when a large vc fund makes a seed investment but chooses not to invest in a series a round the company’s ability to raise additional capital is significantly impaired that negative “signal” could damage both the reputation of the company and the relationship between the entrepreneur and its investor  after  years of building a reputation of trust and respect with entrepreneurs we probably worried as much—or more—about this “signaling risk” than anyone as a result since launching a dedicated seed program in early  it’s something we have proactively measured and monitored from day one the early results so far have been surprising to many with whom we’ve shared the data nea’s seed program has made more than  investments totaling north of  million the portfolio spans multiple sectors of technology consumer enterprise healthcare energy and geography silicon valley boston new york la and dc and represents the diversity of interests and strategies employed by our global partnership we have recently analyzed our first cohort of  seed investments all of whom raised their initial seed rounds between march  and july   the data is as follows total companies  series a investments led by nea  series a investments led by other vcs  total series a investments  wind downs or x ma exits   companies currently “too early to tell” this category includes companies that have not yet tried to raise capital have raised seed extensions in advance of series a or are otherwise too early to tellgiven all of our concern about signaling risk we expected to see more companies that are not funded by nea struggle to raise a series a  instead we have found the opposite at this stage  of our seed companies are getting financed by a vc firm nea or otherwise at series a  our best guess is that more than  will be successful when this cohort fully maturesour seed funded companies have been almost x more likely to get financed by another vc firm not nea  this is the exact opposite of what you would expect to see if signaling risk was significant in determining whether or not other vc firms would invest in nea seeded companies  the fact is that many vc firms choose to invest in neaseeded companies even if nea does not lead the series a  there are many reasons why this occurs but a few of the more consistent ones arestrong fundamentals speak for themselves  when we seed a company we invest in great people differentiated products and large market opportunities these fundamentals tend to be more important than the brand name or composition of a company’s investor syndicate and tend to be highly sought after by many vc firms including neaentrepreneurs have many choices  we are privileged to work with great entrepreneurs who have many options for financing their company  many times other vcs are willing to offer more attractive options than we are able to provide  we are thrilled when our seed companies reach these important milestones independent of the dollar amounts we’ve invested  we are not always the best long term partner  seed companies change course frequently and pivot into spaces or sectors that align better with other vc firms or partners these shifts could also result in direct competition with companies in our existing portfolio and when this occurs we do everything we can to manage conflict and maintain trust with our entrepreneurs and coinvestors  vcs don’t always follow the herd  the vc community is diverse and sophisticated and many firms weigh investments on their merits as they see them not another firm’s opinion  herd mentality is less prevalent in venture capital than some might thinkon this last point it is important to remember that building a successful startup is one of the hardest undertakings on the planet  it should not be surprising that investing in startups is equally challenging  when we make a decision to invest—or not—in a series a it does not always mean we’ve made the right call  we are human and we make mistakes we aim not to repeat those mistakes at series b series c and beyond to be clear we are not claiming that signaling risk does not exist  to this day we are still very careful and selective about our seed investing for this very reason  entrepreneurs have many choices for how to build their seed syndicates and those that choose to work with nea get a partner with a long term perspective at any and every stage of their growth no matter how much money we’ve invested  we aspire to help entrepreneurs build very large companies and have a track record of doing so that spans four decades  this is the strongest signal we send to our entrepreneurs to our coinvestors and to the market and it is a signal that hopefully continues to drown out the noise of signaling risk   ask a vc nea’s jon sakoda on why the venture firm makes

everest  this is not for everyone” – sherpa tensing june note  i went on a trek to everest base camp in  prior to starting my first company  i unexpectedly learned one of the hardest lessons about entrepreneurship loyalty and leadership while on the mountain  this post is for entrepreneurs that have scaled their companies to the highest of altitudes and have come face to face with the realization that not everyone on their team can make the climb   the trek to everest base camp is one of the most beautiful and challenging treks on earth  visited by thousands every year most groups start their journey by flying into a small village at  feet in the heart of the himalayas and spend the next  days pushing up the mountain to nearly  feet  those that come to everest train hard to prepare themselves for the effects of ascending a mountain at such high altitude but there are few places in the world to simulate such strenuous conditions  the trail itself is steep and at extreme elevations your brain and muscles become deprived of oxygen  your body rapidly dehydrates  you experience headaches can’t sleep and lose your appetite  and the conditions only get harder every day as you climb higher    at the beginning of the trek the group is fueled by the pure adrenaline of being on the trail of the tallest mountain on earth  but by  feet the climb gets steeper and the effects of everest begin to set in on everyone  a few people begin to fall back and the pack breaks into two – those that can keep pace and those that cannot  at  feet the gap between the leaders and stragglers grows larger and the landscape turns dry and barren – it is a startling reminder that the conditions do not allow for biological life to thrive  by  feet everyone is starting to show concern for friends and colleagues that are struggling and the group must stop to make tough decision   the final stage of the trek from  to  feet is the greatest challenge  your guides inform you of the choice the group must make  some people will get to everest and some people will have to stay back or go home  it seems unfair that some of the hardest working and best prepared in the group are feeling the most fatigue and that everyone has come so far only to turn back now  but as the group approaches the highest altitudes on earth the conditions are extreme and it is very clear who will need to stay back for the good of those that will continue the journey   as an entrepreneur you don’t need to go to everest to know that there are a lot of parallels between climbing a mountain in extreme conditions and building a startup  starting a company is one of the most physically and emotionally stressful activities you can undertake and it will test even the best trained and qualified of individuals  similar to the beginning of any great expedition startups can thrive on the adrenaline of the adventure ahead  but as you scale your company the path gets steeper and the conditions more challenging  whether you are at  or  employees the road ahead is always more difficult than the already steep trail you’ve climbed and you must confront the reality that you are pushing your team to the highest of altitudes    in a high growth company one of the hardest tests of leadership and loyalty is determining who can make the ascent and who will lag behind  paradoxically the bonds of friendship camaraderie and trust that make startup teams strong in the early part of a company’s life become the hardest obstacles to overcome in making the tough decisions that set up companies to take on the challenges ahead  how can you lead your company through these transitions  here are some best practices i’ve seen great leaders follow through the yearsenforce an honest “bell curve” ranking and don’t inflate grades – every manager loves their team and needs resources to accomplish their goals but ceos need to be honest about their “a” players  “b” players”  and “c” players   stacked and forced rankings of every employee reveals who is likely to keep up and who is likely not to make it  don’t make “churn” a bad word – in a scaling company there is a relentless focus on hiring great talent to fill important roles  but it is equally important to assess overall quality not just quantity along the way and to be honest about hiring mistakes that are inevitable in a hyper growth environment  make employee “churn” a metric that is measured every quarter and don’t make “churn” a bad wordlook to promote from within – when it becomes clear that one of your managers isn’t keeping up the natural tendency is to recruit a seasoned executive  but one of the best and frequently overlooked sources of talented and fresh leadership is within your own organization  rather than force an outside hire find the “a” players deep within your organization that are setting the pace for everyone elsedon’t force people “up or out” – an “a” player can become a “b” player if given too much responsibility too fast and spread too thin  creating a culture that rewards and recognizes “a” players even if they are in entry level and individual contributor roles gives you the best chance at getting your entire team up the mountain i am constantly reminded of and humbled by the trials of entrepreneurship at its highest level  i have witnessed firsthand how difficult it is to challenge the loyalty entrepreneurs have for their teams in order to honestly assess who is ready for the road ahead  but starting and scaling a large and successful company is one of the most challenging endeavors on earth  those blazing the trail must remember that at the highest of altitudes not everyone can make the climb  everest base camp is the start of professional expeditions to the top of mount everest  though thousands of tourists like me go to base camp every year only a few hundred professional climbers successfully climb to the top and as many as a dozen die trying   “we will win

crisis is a terrible thing to waste” – stanford economist paul romer speaking to a group of venture capitalists  the us education system is facing a public crisis of confidence  students at the k level consistently underperform in math science and reading compared to peers in china japan and australiai  school tuition is prohibitively expensive for many and graduates of us higher education institutions today carry more than  trillion in collective student debt  those who do graduate from college often struggle to find longterm employment spurring some to question whether the return on a us higher education merits the investment—particularly in a difficult economic environment where the quality of classroom education is increasingly threatened by layoffs downsized curriculum and shutdown facilities at institutions struggling to survive  with the prospects for over  million students and our economic future at stake the us has no choice but to confront these challenges  we must reform and revive our education system and everyone must do their part the venture capital industry has a longstanding history of bringing us innovation to market—fueling industries like the internet computing telecommunications semiconductors biotechnology and many more  however the industry that catalyzed the creation of companies such as apple intel and google has been largely absent from the classroom investing less than  of its dollars in education every year  today’s education crisis calls for more than politics and policy changes but for a revitalization and reimagination of our education system for the st century  at new enterprise associates nea we see a unique opportunity to invest in entrepreneurship and technology in this education crisis and believe that now is the time for our industry to step up and do its part  working hand in hand with entrepreneurs we are already seeing amazing results today from schools investing in technology to transform their campuses and classrooms  we are inspired by what teachers and students can do through innovation and are confident that we are on the brink of a renaissance in education technology    entrepreneurs and investors have historically proceeded with caution in education for two major reasons  first selling new technology directly to schools is expensive  there are over  schools in the us alone with unique and often complex buying processes second measuring the value of new technology in classrooms has been challenging in a sector that has diverse and often subjective methods of assessment it has been difficult for schools and vendors to demonstrate the efficacy of new learning technologies without prohibitively expensive longterm studies requiring years of data collection these hurdles have made it difficult for small startups to reach economies of scale without significant capital resulting in only a handful of vcbacked success stories in education over the last  years these historical perceptions are changing in an industry that is rapidly embracing new technology and reinventing its methods for teaching and learning advancements in cloud computing have made it possible to run courses online for free the mass proliferation of tablets and smartphones has made it possible to introduce new educational content to millions of teachers and students without working through traditional publishers furthermore lowcost bandwidth around the world has made it possible for anyone with an internet connection to pursue a worldclass education these significant advancements have led to a cambrian explosion in education startups here in the us with vc dollars invested in the sector more than tripling over the last five years there are four major themes shaping and disrupting the education industry as we know it today which we believe create compelling investment opportunities       disappearing classroom wallsthe classroom has traditionally been a broadcastlike experience confined to a physical space and time  teachers lecture and students listen and learn hopefully homework is assigned and class is dismissed this dated traditional model is being transformed by online and mobile platforms schools today are adopting “alwayson” virtual classrooms that facilitate interactive learning anywhere anytime  campuses are rapidly deploying wireless infrastructure to support laptops tablets and smartphones enabling teachers and students to bring their own devices to class  instructors can host their content online poll students on their laptops in class to see if they understand key concepts and adapt their lessons in realtime based on student feedback teachers can connect on social learning sites like edmodo and exchange k content and curriculum with over  peers at other schools students can collaborate any time day or night just by touching an app on their phones and discussion forums can be joined by anyone with an internet connection the virtual classroom has transformed how teachers and students engage both within and beyond physical classroom walls and has invigorated schools to rethink the way they teach         democratizing educational contentthe textbook industry has been traditionally dominated by a handful of major publishers concentrating control over the distribution of educational content to schools the emergence of tablets and smartphones coupled with free distribution channels such as youtube and itunes has created an open marketplace for educational content of unprecedented scale schools today can create their own content at low cost or source content from thousands of publishers offering both free and paid libraries of interactive educational material as one example the nonprofit khan academy today offers over  free classes and has grown to six million monthly visitors in just four years  everfi has delivered financial literacy and substance abuse courses for free to more than  million students one of a growing number of companies that are creating quality content online in partnership with corporations and foundations  education apps represent the secondlargest category in apple’s app store with over  active applications from thousands of publishers parents and students now subscribe to education services such as benchprep to access hundreds of standardized test prep courses for just  per month this democratization of content enables schools and students to choose the best product from the best publisher at the best price forcing traditional publishers nonprofits and aspiring entrepreneurs to compete on a more level playing field         learning from big data analyticsamazoncom a pioneer in “big data” analytics can recommend the best products for each customer in realtime based on prior behavior and can even predict when you will abandon your shopping cart using similar technology schools can improve student outcomes based on personalized learning pathways and can aid struggling students well before it is too late to act  using platforms such as desirelearn administrators can aggregate learning analytics at the school district state or even national level enabling best practices and insights to be shared among stakeholders the state of tennessee recently demonstrated the power of desirelearn’s statewide predictive analytics lowering their annual dropout rate by  across  university campuses by looking at historical student data and identifying opportunities for faculty and administrators to intervene  this is one of the most promising frontiers in education technology only recently made possible by shifts to more competencybased or outcomesbased education cbe  obe standardized curricula eg common core and analytic technologies such as hadoop       transforming local campuses to global institutionsthough the us today is the largest market for education globally it is far from the fastest growing  china india and brazil are rapidly increasing their investment in education and have national aspirations and mandates to catch up with the developed world china already graduates more college students with math science and engineering degrees than the us and chinese citizens spend  times more of their disposable income on education than americans on a percentage basis the us particularly in higher education is home to the most respected learning institutions on the planet and the emerging markets have seemingly insatiable demand to access it more than one million students have registered for free for online classes through coursera which partners with more than  leading institutions like stanford penn and michigan today the vast majority of those students are from outside the united states forcing schools to rethink the boundaries of their campuses  technology has made distance learning effective and economically feasible and schools must embrace a global student market if they are to thrive in tomorrow’s education economy these four trends indicate a seismic shift in the education landscape and they are creating unique opportunities for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to develop innovative technology that can bring about a critical transformation in education  through our growing portfolio of companies in this space we can see what is possible when educators and entrepreneurs work together  we are not naïve to the challenges ahead nor to the obstacles that will be faced in reviving our education system  but venture capitalists are by definition optimists and we believe the technology we are helping to build today will empower the transformation of the education industry over the next decade  we believe we can improve learning outcomes and decrease education costs  we believe in our teachers and our schools  and most importantly we believe that we must invest in our entrepreneurs and education system to confront and address the challenges we face today  we see amazing opportunity in this education crisis and after all a crisis is a terrible thing to wastei oecd pisa scores   the united states failed to make the top  in math and failed to make the top  in science or reading

commercial powerhouse behind mongodb the fastest growing open source database on the planet  nea led a  million investment in the company providing a huge warchest for gen to continue its assault on the relational database market  frustrated by legacy products like oracle and mysql developers have flocked to mongo en mass – mongo is downloaded nearly  times a month and today reaches  million

companies alike mongo is more than an open source movement – it is now a widespread revolt against oracle and the incumbent relational database nea has long funded companies that have attacked the “one size fits all” database market at its point of greatest vulnerability –“big data” analytics  through our investments in companies such as vertica acquired by hp mapr and wibidata we have seen the emergence of alternative data stores purpose built for webscale analytics  but mongo has opened up a new front in the assault on oracle offering developers a true operational data store for rapid and agile development  in a world where application development cycles have gone from months or years to days or even hours developers need databases that give them speed and flexibility  mongo gives developers a data model that frees them from the restrictions of relational mapping and complex schemas yet is designed to scale horizontally as applications grow  it’s a powerful approach that is a disruptive force in the industry and is clearly capturing the hearts and minds of millions of developers around the worldtaking on oracle in the rdbms market is one of the greatest challenges and

don draper mad men i am excited to announce our recent investment in brandless a bold new consumer packaged goods cpg company that officially launched today  brandless’ mission is simple but significant offer healthconscious products at a disruptively low price point that can’t easily be replicated by established cpg conglomerates  over the past several decades consumers have grown to believe that high quality responsiblysourced products such as organic or chemicalfree food should cost more than lesser counterparts sold under national brands  brandless aims to challenge this way of thinking and in doing so change the way we shop for everyday items  the cpg industry is a  billion market that reaches every american household—from the kitchen counter to the pantry and beyond  decades ago this industry could introduce lowcost highmargin products to the world through television ad campaigns and national wholesale distribution  in recent years the traditional brand advertising approach has largely grown stale in today’s digital era and has eroded consumer trust across an industry that has lost touch with modern buying behavior  today’s consumers are often digital natives with discerning taste—seeking both value distinguishable quality and values healthy responsibly sourced in the products they consume despite rapidly increasing supply and demand for healthier more sustainable food products the cpg industry has largely kept prices  higher than lowerquality alternatives under household brands  this price distortion has sadly made “eating right” and “buying right” unaffordable aspirations for many alienating today’s value and values oriented consumer   brandless has a fresh take a datadriven approach to every sku working with the best suppliers around the globe to introduce unique products that meet their incredibly high standards for transparency quality and value  their everyday essentials collection will include hundreds of handpicked items that reflect the most imperative product values such as organic nongmo free of artificial colors and flavors at an affordable price  everything at brandless is  frequently offering comparable quantities of better quality products than skus that generally cost  to  in any grocery store for those who struggle with the sticker shock of  organic pasta sauce and  organic granola brandless offers incredible alternatives for just   the value speaks for itself from cost to quality to taste—the products are filling and fulfilling at a price point that is simple and hard to resist  don’t just trust me read more about the products herebrandless can sell such highquality products at lower price points by removing the hidden “brand tax” from their cost structure and sharing the savings directly with consumers  traditional cpg incumbents incur a  increase in overall “cost” because of their legacy supply chains inefficient marketing channels and high distributor markups — which is subsequently paid by consumers via higher prices for almost everything we purchase on a regular basis  new entrants are not plagued by these same historic taxes enabling brandless to remove additional costs from day one  as a result every product offered has substantial savings when compared to traditional brands as high as  in some categories depending on the size of the industry “brand tax” that is stripped from its price  if successful across many skus this disruptive approach will unbundle the “brand tax” from many aisles in grocery stores today and increase overall access to healthier higher quality food and household goods for everyone  we invest in entrepreneurs who challenge conventional wisdom and want to change the world and that’s exactly what i found when i met tina sharkey ido leffler and the whole brandless team  tina and ido have dedicated their careers to building consumer products and brands in family health and education and their professional successes have been both causecentric and double bottom line  they believed that a new transparent authentic supplier could change the way we view price and value in grocery stores ultimately liberating us all from paying the “brand tax”  today is the beginning of a significant movement and i hope you will all join us in “going brandless” aera  welcome the “self driving” enterprise i am excited to unveil our  m

matters in media today we are excited to announce a  m financing for the players’ tribune a sports media company founded by derek jeter in derek’s vision was to create a media company that focused uniquely on the needs of athletes and fans and he recruited an amazing group of athletes and entrepreneurs to his allstar team  it has been an amazing experience watching our company grow from a small blog to the trusted media platform for the athlete community and we are thrilled to have ivp and google as investors in our latest round in a world that is flooded with clickbait and fake news the players’ tribune has differentiated itself by focusing on original high quality highly engaging content  we break critical news and celebrate human achievement through sports but more importantly we tell the stories that are left untold by traditional media outlets  i am perhaps most proud of our athletes and editors who have taken bold positions on issues such as domestic violence racism and gender discrimination  these stories require courage and conviction and have had meaningful impact well beyond the sports world  we are one of many important companies trying to rebuild the media industry around authenticity and trust and would not be able to do so without our amazing team and the faith of our  athlete contributors the media world has undergone a dramatic shift over the course of the last decade and the  billion sports media market is finally undergoing its transition from traditional to digital distribution  this tectonic shift creates huge opportunities for new entrants

and we need a new army “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result”  – albert einstein  “it may sound crazy to try this  but it is also irresponsible not to…” – bill gurley i am excited to announce our investment in hackerone the leading cybersecurity marketplace which connects enterprises and governments to responsible and ethical hackers  many of the largest internet companies such as facebook google and microsoft learned years ago that in order to protect their sites against attacks they needed more than firewalls vulnerability scanners and security consultants  they needed an army – and they quietly enlisted tens of thousands of developers around the world to openly hack them   the results were astounding – at facebook alone public hackers reported more bugs in  hours than had previously been discovered by their internal team throughout the entire previous year after paying out millions of dollars to hackers for successful disclosure these internet platforms surprisingly pioneered one of the most provocative and increasingly effective programs in the security industry today  the bug bounty  more than  billion is spent annually by enterprises and governments to secure their digital assets – this number has grown substantially over the past  years but nonetheless there is increasing frustration that we’ve lost the war on cybercrime  in the past year alone jp morgan lost consumer data for more than  million account holders target lost more than  million credit and debit card numbers and the federal government lost over  million confidential records of employees with security clearance  furthermore more than  of all corporations have reported some type of breach and it seems that every day we learn about yet another important organization that has been compromised in some way  the cybersecurity industry faces a spending paradox that perplexes many leaders sitting in boardrooms today – “if we’re investing more money in security why aren’t we any more secure”  there are generally two widely accepted answers to this questionmost security solutions protect you from known threats  however the threats that matter the most are the threats you haven’t seen  security is not a technology problem – it’s a human problem  no amount of software or computing power can fully protect you from the creativity agility and at times stupidity of mankind  these issues are not new to the industry but organizations that are using hackerone are finally tackling them head on  first hackerone helps companies enlist an army of humans into the war on cybercrime  today more than  organizations have paid out substantial bounties to tens of thousands of responsible hackers and i expect millions of software developers will ultimately join the fight to protect the internet  second hackerone’s community is already finding vulnerabilities previously undetected by the most advanced software making it possible for organizations to see threats before they are exploited  some surveys report that only  of real threats are detected by today’s best security products  hackerone is finding orders of magnitude more vulnerabilities from their community of hackers giving organizations a chance to see and fix their problems well advance of a significant attack  as an entrepreneur i founded a security company and served with many friends in the war against cybercrime  i am personally thrilled to work with the hackerone team – the security industry has always attracted some of the brightest minds in software development but we’ve fallen behind and need to embrace a completely new approach  we need to enlist a new army to fight this war and with hackerone we can build a community to make the internet a safer place  should your organization work with hackers  it would be insane not to one of the great testimonials of bug bounties is from sheryl sandberg chief operating officer of facebook  click here to see her interview why derek jeter is hitting a home run as an entrepreneur “i love it when people doubt me it makes me work harder to prove them wrong”  – derek jeter i am excited to announce our investment in the players’ tribune an innovative new media company founded by derek jeter  nea has a longstanding history of working with accomplished entrepreneurs but few with a career as celebrated as derek’s which includes  world series titles and  allstar appearances  derek is known not only for his commitment to excellence and incredible work ethic but also for his humility and integrity both on and off the field  upon retirement from baseball derek has found a new mission in the players’ tribune and hopes to ultimately transform and reinvent the way that athletes connect with fans  in a very short period of time he has attracted over  of the most influential athletes to participate and has recruited a worldclass executive team to join him   the tectonic plates of the  billion sports media industry have been shifting for years due to the rapid adoption of mobile devices the rising popularity of over the top ott content services and the widespread use of social media  these technology waves have made it possible for new media companies such as the players’ tribune to work directly with athletes to create unique and compelling content that can reach millions of fans around the world  derek’s vision is to have the players’ tribune provide authentic editorial and live interactive experiences leveraging the most modern and disruptive technology available  for example the players’ tribune recently partnered with video conferencing pioneer blue jeans network another nea portfolio company to enable individual athletes to communicate with over  fans using interactive way video  this is just one of many ways that the players’ tribune is transforming the relationship between athletes and fans – stay tuned as there is much more to come the great entrepreneurs that nea has backed throughout our  year history share a few common traits  i they are passionate about their mission and vision ii they are fearless and competitive iii they move with speed and agility and iv they attract great talent and build amazing teams  it is fair to say that derek has already embodied these characteristics throughout his life – and though some may ask whether he can have as successful a career as an entrepreneur as he enjoyed in baseball i personally don’t think you want to bet against him  nea raises new  billion fund the largest vc fund ever raisedhttpwwwbusinessinsidercomnearaisesnewbillionfund qa with neas jon sakoda on big tech challenges  silicon valley business journal “show up for your entrepreneurs when nobody else will” – my interview with silicon valley business journalhttpwwwbizjournalscomsanjosenewsneasjonsakodaonbigtechchallengesfundinghtmlpageall do your vcs have an uncomfortably high burn rate  this blog is a followup to fortune’s dan primack and his post  the startup world’s other ‘cash burn’ problem” where he suggests that venture capitalists by and large have a burn rate problem over the past several weeks much attention has been placed on unquestionably high startup burn rates and whether entrepreneurs should change their current operating models in the face of a potential downturn   but an equally important question for entrepreneurs is whether the vc industry and specifically the firms that have invested in your startup have an uncomfortably high burn rate  have we invested too quickly in other startups and have alarmingly low cash reserves  have we prepared for a downturn for many entrepreneurs the idea that a vc firm could run out of money feels highly unlikely  but vc firms have their own “burn rate”—they do not have unlimited capital and must manage their investable cash between new investments and reserves for followon investments  the rule of thumb is that vc firms should reserve about  for every  invested in a portfolio company  in good times when capital from a variety of sources including hedge funds mutual funds and wealthy individuals chases after startups vc firms tend to reserve a little less as they can rely on alternative sources of funding  when the cycle turns these alternative sources tend to exit the industry leaving only “traditional” vcs who have the appetite conviction and capacity to continue investing  vc fund reserves enable the industry to fund its best companies during tough times within nea’s own portfolio some of our biggest wins—companies like groupon opower tableau software and workday were supported through some of the darkest days of venture capital between  and is the venture industry prepared for a downturn the following chart shows how much capital has been raised in the us venture industry over the past plus years—over  billion since   it is very hard to know exactly how much has been invested by each individual firm but it is possible to estimate how rapidly funds have deployed their capital over the past  years and how much capital is reserved for a rainy day  most funds commit their capital over a  year investment period with the vast majority of new investments made in the first  years and the remainder of the funds “reserved” for followon investments in that fund over the subsequent  years  using a set of assumptions to gauge how fast each fund invests their capital we can estimate how much capital is reserved across the industry  based on the chart below our best guess is that the industry will have  billion of available capital and  billion of capital earmarked for reserves at the end of this year  this may seem like a lot of money in aggregate but for many entrepreneurs that have never experienced a severe downturn when all of the nontraditional sources of venture capital flee the market there are a few warningsventure backed companies from all sources are raising  billion per quarter  if the vc industry alone were to attempt to fund all current vc backed companies at today’s levels through a downturn we would effectively run out of reserves in  quarters  it is obvious that the industry investment pace would have to slow down dramatically at least  from current levels in order to extend the runway of our reserves through the cycle the  billion in capital that is reserved must be shared across thousands of companies that have received  billion in venture financings between  and   that’s  of reserves for every  dollar invested in venture capital per company  under certain extraordinary circumstances even the top quartile of vc funded companies will be fighting for their fair share though the above numbers may be alarming in aggregate the good news is that many vc firms are resilient and prepared for times like these  some firms like nea take a very conservative approach to creating reserves to ensure that we always have cash for our portfolio companies  in addition the industry has established many tools to extend cash runway including fund recycling investing profits from old investments into strong existing portfolio companies and both formal and informal coinvestment vehicles with lps that can create more capacity for much needed capital  these approaches are not universally employed but they can mitigate the effects of a downturn and provide a boost to the industry’s reserve capacity to help companies through tough timesour industry is nearly  years old and has largely survived several economic downturns while keeping our best companies alive  as an entrepreneur it is tempting to be lured into a false sense of security or paranoia by knowing whether your existing investors can fund you through the next economic cycle  great companies find a way to attract capital no matter how difficult the financing environment and average companies won’t survive a downturn no matter how well capitalized or strong their vc syndicates  as vc’s and entrepreneurs we must cherish the capital we have been given invest it wisely and efficiently and together build great companies that can last  this is the best way to survive a downturn and ensure that together we can weather a storm    the industry “burn rate” is calculated by measuring the  of vc funds that are deployed in any given year based on their vintage year  for purposes of this analysis we included all nvca  moneytree us vc funds closed since  and have modeled deployment of each fund such that  of every fund is invested over  years and  is reserved over the following  years  “capital remaining” includes capital for both new investments and reserves for followons  “capital reserved” includes only capital specifically earmarked for reserves after initial investments are made  for more detail please email jsakodaneacomjon’s perspectives on vc and entrepreneurship can be found at wwwjonsakodacom or on twitter jonsakoda update signal or noise nea’s experience with signaling risk this updated post is a followup to my interview with connie loizos at strictlyvc who posted my qa never mind what angels say vcs have your back  my original post was published in july nea is one of the largest vc firms by assets under management and has quietly become one of the most active seed investors in the industry launching a seed program was controversial both within the firm and throughout the seed investment community  the primary concern was “signaling risk” or the notion that when a large vc fund makes a seed investment but chooses not to invest in a series a round the company’s ability to raise additional capital is significantly impaired that negative “signal” could damage both the reputation of the company and the relationship between the entrepreneur and its investor  after  years of building a reputation of trust and respect with entrepreneurs we probably worried as much—or more—about this “signaling risk” than anyone as a result since launching a dedicated seed program in early  it’s something we have proactively measured and monitored from day one the early results so far have been surprising to many with whom we’ve shared the data nea’s seed program has made more than  investments totaling north of  million the portfolio spans multiple sectors of technology consumer enterprise healthcare energy and geography silicon valley boston new york la and dc and represents the diversity of interests and strategies employed by our global partnership we have recently analyzed our first cohort of  seed investments all of whom raised their initial seed rounds between march  and august   the data is as follows total companies  series a investments led by nea  series a investments led by other vcs  total series a investments  wind downs or ma exits   companies currently “too early to tell” this category includes companies that have not yet tried to raise capital have raised seed extensions in advance of series a or are otherwise too early to tellgiven all of our concern about signaling risk we expected to see more companies that are not funded by nea struggle to raise a series a  instead we have found the opposite at this stage  of our seed companies are getting financed by a vc firm nea or otherwise at series a  our best guess is that more than  will be successful when this cohort fully maturesour seed funded companies have been  more likely to get financed by another vc firm not nea  this is the exact opposite of what you would expect to see if signaling risk was significant in determining whether or not other vc firms would invest in nea seeded companies   the fact is that many vc firms choose to invest in neaseeded companies even if nea does not lead the series a  there are many reasons why this occurs but a few of the more consistent ones arestrong fundamentals speak for themselves  when we seed a company we invest in great people differentiated products and large market opportunities these fundamentals tend to be more important than the brand name or composition of a company’s investor syndicate and tend to be highly sought after by many vc firms including neaentrepreneurs have many choices  we are privileged to work with great entrepreneurs who have many options for financing their company  many times other vcs are willing to offer more attractive options than we are able to provide  we are thrilled when our seed companies reach these important milestones independent of the dollar amounts we’ve investedwe are not always the best long term partner  seed companies change course frequently and pivot into spaces or sectors that align better with other vc firms or partners these shifts could also result in direct competition with companies in our existing portfolio and when this occurs we do everything we can to manage conflict and maintain trust with our entrepreneurs and coinvestorsvcs don’t always follow the herd  the vc community is diverse and sophisticated and many firms weigh investments on their merits as they see them not another firm’s opinion  herd mentality is less prevalent in venture capital than some might thinkon this last point it is important to remember that building a successful startup is one of the hardest undertakings on the planet  it should not be surprising that investing in startups is equally challenging  when we make a decision to invest—or not—in a series a it does not always mean we’ve made the right call  we are human and we make mistakes we aim not to repeat those mistakes at series b series c and beyond to be clear we are not claiming that signaling risk does not exist  to this day we are still very careful and selective about our seed investing for this very reason  entrepreneurs have many choices for how to build their seed syndicates and those that choose to work with nea get a partner with a long term perspective at any and every stage of their growth no matter how much money we’ve invested  this is the strongest signal we send to our entrepreneurs to our coinvestors and to the market and it is a signal that hopefully continues to drown out the noise of signaling
