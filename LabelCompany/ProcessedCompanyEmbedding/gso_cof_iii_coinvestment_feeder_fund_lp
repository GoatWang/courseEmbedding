or if there is something of particular interest to you that you would like me to address background a hedge fund is typically registered as commodity pool and the underlying strategy can often be inferred from the name new pool registrations give you useful market and competitive information if nothing else you may get a headsup that a competitor is bringing something new to market the source of data is the national futures association’s nfa background affiliation status information center basic website these posts will form a series parallel to the one i recently started on the largest hedge funds by regulatory assets under management that series uses data sourced from the sec’s investment advisor public depository website around  new pools are registered with the nfa each month so i don’t have space to list them all here i will limit the table to those pools registered by the largest hedge fund firms this way you will be able to see the latest productrelated strategic moves

contact me to discuss custom research and reporting projects methodology in order to complete the research for this post i made use of a script in r using the rselenium package i have previously published a post about how to set up rselenium using the latest version of selenium and an earlier post reviewing some of the most useful functions in the package this package makes it possible to automate the collection of data from websites the process is called webscraping the nfa assigns pool id numbers in numerical order i start with the most recently identified pool and increment the pool id then search in basic for that pool if the pool is found i record the names and ids of the commodity pool operators i also check for the date the pool ceased trading futures or ceased trading altogether to ensure i do not include dead pools i keep going until i run out of pools i check at least  successive pool ids have no pool associated with them finally for the purpose of this post i purge the list of pool operators who do not appear on my  largest hedge funds master list note that this list includes about  firms who are affiliated with the various large hedge fund companies image
