and certain derivatives  into various industrial applications predominately as a component for hydraulic fracturing of shale natural gas wells choline chloride in clay stabilization for the oil and natural gas industry drilling and stimulation in shale and other clay containing formations pose challenges due to clay swelling this swelling causes a number of issues including wellbore instability cuttings disintegration bit balling fines migration reductions in permeability of the formation to hydrocarbons these issues can result in higher drilling costs and slower production rates  clay stabilizers reduce clay swelling and its associated risks leading to lower drilling costs and improved production rates potassium chloride kcl is commonly used in preventing the swelling of clay as a temporary clay stabilizer   however the use of kcl in drilling carries environmental concerns as clorides do not degrade and can enter surface water carrying heavy metal including cadmium and mercury choline chloride and choline bicarbonate offer an attractive effective and more environmentally responsible alternative than other clay stabilizers balchems industrial grade choline bicarbonate is completely chloride free while our choline chloride reduces the amount of chlorides released into the environment up to  when compared to kcl  the key features offered by choline salts as an alternative to traditional clay stabilizers include biodegradability and reduction in the amount of chlorides superior performance and use at much lower levels compatibility with brine calcium chloride and kcl solutions ability to work well with known fracturing fluids crosslinkers and breakers minimization in chemical handling including premixing and saltwater disposal flexibility for use

and offsetting any weakness the company may see in industrials fourthquarter results released after the market closed on tuesday showed a nice rise in sales and record results for  heres a look at the quarters numbers and what investors should take from the results  image source getty images balchem corporation results the raw numbers metricq q yearoveryear change  sales  million  million    net income  million   million    adjusted eps       data source balchem corporation q  earnings report what happened with balchem corporation this quarter  while the broad numbers are important a look inside balchem shows where the real industry trends are playing out here are a few highlights human nutrition and health revenue was up  in the quarter to  million helped by the acquisition of albion earnings from operations were up  to  million although if you pull out the impact of amortizing acquired intangible assets the adjusted earnings from operations jumped  to  million  animal nutrition and health revenue rose  to  million and sales were up  sequentially yearoveryear earnings for the segment were up  to  million as higher volumes helped drive operating results  specialty product sales were up  to  million but earnings from operations fell  to  million an unfavorable mix of products and higher raw materials costs were blamed for the decline  industrial product was the one weak spot with sales down  to  million as volumes of choline and choline derivatives for oil and natural gas fracking declined despite the decline earnings from operations rose  million to  million as the company focused on more profitable products  this completes a year where sales hit a record of  million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda jumped  to  million this gives management the freedom to acquire companies or improve the balance sheet with the cash generation going forward  what management said ceo ted harris highlighted the companys financial improvement despite some headwinds in  mainly in energy markets he sees human and animal health markets as growth drivers in the future through both organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions  its possible that industrial revenue could be at a low point too with oil and natural gas drilling starting to pick up again this will be an area to watch in  because it could turn from a headwind to a slight tailwind  looking forward this year will build on the strategic moves management made to grow balchem in  the momentum were seeing in operations isnt showing any signs of slowing and with health a big focus for consumers the growth trends should continue  travis hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends balchem the motley fool has a
