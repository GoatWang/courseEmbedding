insights  january   by sam oches who is sardar biglari the ceo of steak ‘n shake is using his unique style to try to reboot the companys operations image used with permission bookmarksearch this post email this story printerfriendly version read more about finance growth sam oches steak n shake when sardar biglari moved with his family to the us in  steak ‘n shake was already a verified favorite on the quickserve scene in fact the triedandtrue midwestern chain was celebrating its th anniversary the year biglari immigrated to san antonio from iran today  years later biglari is chairman and ceo of biglari holdings the parent company of steak ‘n shake western sizzlin and investment management firm biglari capital corp a group of subsidiary companies that together are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he’s only  years old since joining steak ‘n shake’s board of directors in march  and then taking over as chairman and ceo in august of that year biglari has implemented a topdown overhaul of its operations the overhaul has helped the company to  straight quarters of samestore sales growth as of q  steak ‘n shake also went from losing more than  a day in  to making more than  a day in  according to biglari’s  letter to shareholders the man behind the success however can only be described as a mystery his aggressive approach to taking control of businesses has put off some and his move to standardize pricing and menus across steak ‘n shake’s system sparked a backlash from franchisees some of whom even filed a lawsuit against him he’s also known for playing close to the vest as proven by his refusal to speak with media including qsr “although we cheerfully will discuss our investment philosophy and operating catechism as we believe it necessary to clarify expectations for our shareholders we will not telegraph our interests in specific publicly traded companies our rationale or our plans” biglari said in his  letter “outside of regulatory requirements we will not air our investment ideas particularly in a world of investment competitors we leave the yammering to others” the sage of san antonio in the investment community there is no greater idol than warren buffett the chairman and ceo of omaha nebraska–based berkshire hathaway has made billions by turning a simple textile mill into a holding company that possesses the highestvalued stock on the new york stock exchange perhaps nobody respects buffett quite like biglari does the young businessman reportedly was inspired to become an investor after reading a book about buffett and discovering that the two shared a birthday rumor goes that he has buffettsigned memorabilia in his office and follows berkshire hathaway’s progress carefully today no article or investment analysis is written about biglari without a comparison to buffett after all it’s not lost on people that his san antonio–based holding company is structured quite similarly to buffett’s or that biglari holdings shares initials with buffett’s berkshire hathaway and until this article was written had a similar website to the oracle of omaha’s jim gillies a private investor and contractor for financialservices company the motley fool has followed biglari’s career since  and is a biglari holdings shareholder “i think biglari has cultivated an image of trying to be another buffett and if some of the investment community ran a little too far with that analogy that’s hardly his fault—although he did nothing to discourage it” gillies says biglari and his business partner philip cooley built a solid portfolio of investments between  and  when they purchased a share of western sizzlin a southeastbased chain of mostly franchised buffet restaurants in early  after purchasing more western sizzlin corporation stock biglari became chairman of the board at the company he then took an investor’s approach to western sizzlin by creating a holding company that broke the chain up by individual subsidiaries each subsidiary was treated as a separate business and cash from each was redirected to the best investment within the holding company since taking control of western sizzlin which biglari holdings fully acquired in  biglari has continued to pursue opportunities in the restaurant industry this includes an attempted takeover of friendly’s and at various points holding significant amounts of shares in sonic and red robin at press biglari was also involved in a proxy fight with cracker barrel he refuses however to be considered a restaurantfocused company and has made moves to diversify his portfolio including a failed attempt at acquiring an insurance company “the critical point is that we could in one particular moment derive most of our earnings from one industry such as restaurants and then with a single large acquisition begin to derive most of our earnings from a different industry” biglari said in his  letter “although capital allocation is a crucial element at most businesses it is our business at bh” when biglari invested in steak ‘n shake in  the company had been growing sales each year but it was also spending too much on new stores and operations and not getting a return on investment in addition gillies says it was breaching its debt covenants and not taking advantage of millions in possible tax refunds “biglari was very critical of the prior management of steak ‘n shake for enriching themselves at the cost of the investor” gillies says “i believe steak ‘n shake was probably on the very short course toward flirting with bankruptcy” so after buying shares in the company biglari began complaining to management about its poor execution and lobbying to shareholders for a change he asked for seats for himself and cooley on the company’s board of directors and was denied he then upped the campaign against steak ‘n shake’s management launching a website that demanded change and even buying billboard space in the concept’s hometown of indianapolis in march  he and cooley were voted overwhelmingly onto the company’s board of directors by shareholders by august biglari was ceo and chairman and was already working actively on turning the ship around—a ship from which many on the prior management team had already jumped gillies says biglari is “not a restaurant guy” but that “he’s immersed himself in that world” so he can increase
