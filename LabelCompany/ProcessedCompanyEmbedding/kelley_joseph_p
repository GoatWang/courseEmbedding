cattle perfectly under control with equal skill that would be joe kelley though hes penned up much of the time these days mr kelley used to interrupt his work after tax season every year telling his bosses at the former tax accounting firm coopers and lybrand in cleveland he was bound for wyoming or idaho “when the weather turned nice i said you guys are crazy for working inside the real life is a cowboy” mr kelley  would tell his bosses every year then when the snows hit the range mr kelley would come back to coopers and lybrand work through winter and spring and leave again after about five years of that cycle mr kelley finally gave in to the firms pleas that he begin working as a cpa year round and since then his financial career has taken off like a good quarter horse he went to chicago worked with a startup and shepherded it through an initial public offering got married and eventually went to work for lincoln electric co in  as director of accounting before becoming cfo of
