unaudited   note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies   organization   interactive multimedia auction corporation the “company” was incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands on july   the company is in the business of an internet based marketer auctioneer dealer and broker of high quality and unique products and services for fine art fashion design and décor   interim period financial statements   the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” for interim financial information and with the securities and exchange commission’s instructions accordingly they do not include all the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements the results of operations reflect interim adjustments all of which are of a normal recurring nature and in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such interim period the results reported in these interim financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year certain information and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the securities and exchange commission’s rules and regulations these unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended october   as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february     going concern   the company’s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not generated any revenue since commencement of the development stage has an accumulated deficit and has had no positive cash flows from operations it is the company’s intention to raise additional equity to finance development of a market for its products until positive cash flows can be generated from its operations however there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to the company when required or on terms acceptable to the company such limitations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or operations and these financial statements do not include any adjustment that could result failure to obtain sufficient additional funding would necessitate the company to reduce or limit its operating activities or even discontinue operations    cash   cash equivalents with maturity dates less than  days from the date of origination are considered to be cash equivalents for all financial reporting purposes the company currently has cash equivalents of  as of july     fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the exchange price that will be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to measure fair value the company uses the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered to be observable and the third unobservable   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  – inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities          revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue which includes charges on a transactional and other basis realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured   advertising expenses   advertising costs are expensed as incurred the company did not incur any advertising costs during the three and nine month periods ended july   and    income taxes   deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted income tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled realization of certain deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the initial recording and any subsequent changes to valuation allowances are based on a number of factors positive and negative evidence the company considers its actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance   the company continually evaluates its uncertain income tax positions and may record a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense respectively   because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations significant judgment is required as a result the company makes certain estimates and assumptions in  calculating its income tax expense deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and  evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions the company’s estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized   as the company is incorporated in the british virgin islands as an international corporporation it is not subject to any corporate income taxes in the british virgin islands   net loss per share   basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period diluted loss per share takes into consideration common shares outstanding computed under basic loss per share and potentially dilutive securities for the nine month periods ended july   and  there are no outstanding stock options and warrants common shares issuable are considered outstanding as of the original approval date for purposes of earnings per share computations   foreign currencies   assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income for the three and nine month periods ended july   and  the company did not have material translation adjustments and accordingly no statement of comprehensive income loss is included in the accompanying financial statements          use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year the company bases its estimates on historical experience current conditions and on other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions   financial instruments   the company has the following financial instruments accounts payable and loan payable the carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value due to their liquidity or their shortterm nature   share issuances for services debt instruments and interest   the company issues instruments to nonemployees for the receipt of goods and services and in certain circumstances the settlement of shortterm loan arrangements the applicable gaap establishes that sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable   in these transactions the company issues unregistered and restricted equity instruments additionally the company currently has no shares of freelytradeable stock with a quoted market price a level input within the gaap hierarchy   when unregistered common shares are issued for the settlement of shortterm financing arrangements that are not initially convertible the reacquisition price of the extinguished financing arrangement is determined by the value of the debt which is more clearly evident and no additional inducement expense is recognized   in situations in which the company issues unregistered restricted common shares in exchange for goods and services and the value of the goods and services are not the most reliably measurable the company recognizes the fair value of the unregistered restricted equity instruments based on the value of similar instruments issued in private placements in exchange for cash in the most recent transactions a level  input within the gaap hierarchy the company has determined this methodology reflects the risk adjusted fair value of its unregistered restricted equity instruments using a commercially reasonable valuation technique   comprehensive income loss   our company has no components of other comprehensive income loss and accordingly no statement of comprehensive income loss is included in the accompanying financial statements   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standard update “asu”  – revenue from contracts with customers which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the core principal of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract   in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no  which eliminated certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously identified as development stage entities topic  the amendments in this asu simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities the amendments also reduce data maintenance and for those entities subject to audit audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities to present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity   early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entitys financial statements have not yet been issued public business entities or made available for issuance other entities upon adoption entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by topic   the company has adopted this standard          the original effective date for asu  would have required the company to adopt beginning in its first quarter  in july  the fasb voted to amend asu  by approving a one year deferral of the effective date as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date accordingly the company may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of  or  the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption the company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its financial statements   note  longterm loan payable   the loan of  payable to a shareholder of the company is unsecured noninterest bearing and due on or before october     note

unaudited financial statements for the three and ninemonth periods ended july   and  and our annual report on form k for the year ended october   including the financial statements and notes thereto   forwardlooking information may prove inaccurate   this report contains statements about the future sometimes referred to as “forwardlooking” statements forwardlooking statements are typically identified by the use of the words “believe” “may” “could” “should” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “project” “propose” “plan” “intend” and similar words and expressions statements that describe our future strategic plans goals or objectives are also forwardlooking statements   readers of this report are cautioned that any forwardlooking statements including those regarding our management’s current beliefs expectations anticipations estimations projections proposals plans or intentions are not guarantees of future performance or results of events and involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking information is based on present circumstances and on our predictions respecting events that have not occurred that may not occur or that may occur with different consequences from those now assumed or anticipated actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors the forwardlooking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report we are not obligated to update such forwardlooking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances   introduction   our business is intended to be based on marketing and selling products using an online ecommerce platform which provides a live streaming auction production in contrast to sites like ebay or bidcom which for the most part are driven by sales of items that given their mass production have become “commodities” that anyone can buy and access from an infinite amount of vendors and providers at extremely low prices it is our goal to offer only unique and valued products and goods we believe that there is significant interest for products and services of particular distinction with great demand for items actually produced from all parts of the world  we believe that for reasons of geography demography or simply lack of marketing and advertising resources many extraordinary products simply remain unnoticed by the mass market  consequently we plan to operate a realtime auction internet streaming broadcast from various geographic locations around the world that will focus specifically on representing and promoting distinct and innovative goods produced by local manufacturers purveyors designers and creators  viewers across the globe will be able to view the action on their computers ipads or mobile phones and they will be able to participate by bidding on the items via telephone or the internet   during the quarter ended july   discussions have continued with various types of product and service providers in terms of establishing formal working relationships with them at such time that we are capable of undertaking our initial business launch yet these discussions still have not resulted into a material agreement and there can be no assurance that we will have any formal agreement with any party at all   we additionally plan to establish and operate a userfriendly and functional ecommerce website in support of our online sales business once operational        results of operations   comparison of the three and nine months ended july   with the three and nine months ended july     we

the nine months ended july     our current balances of cash will not meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the whole of the current year because we are not currently generating sufficient cash to fund our operations we will need to rely on external financing to meet future capital and operating requirements any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty our capital requirements depend upon several factors including the rate of market acceptance our ability to get to production and generate revenues our level of expenditures for production marketing and sales purchases of equipment and other factors we can make no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all further if we issue equity securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants that could restrict our operations or finances if we cannot raise funds when needed on acceptable terms we may not be able to continue our operations grow market share take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements all of which could negatively impact our business operating

but is generally positive about the company in my opinion the article is very heavy on artrelated auction sites in general but very light on specifics about this particular company the author concludes the stock is a highrisk investment but it provide a very unique investment opportunity not typically afforded investors in the public market these days i decided to write a counterarticle as i couldnt disagree more i believe imma is not suitable for any kind of long investment background imma went public in  despite some initial concerns from the sec thirtytwo shareholders used the ipo to sell all of their shares none of the proceeds went to the company three years later according to its latest quarterly filing imma has literally zero cash k in liabilities and no employees yet the current stock price of  assumes a market cap of  million this is even after the stock crashed  on the th of may from a market cap of over  million previously at the time imma went public there appeared to be two driving forces behind the company hongkong based morpheus financial corporation and an american actressproducer named amber mccandless these two appear to go back quite a while both morpheus and the mccandless family were involved in the ipo of essential innovations technology otcesiv in  management amber mccandless signed on with imma as its ceo and in effect its president cfo treasurer secretary and director mccandless committed to spending approximately  hours per week on the business at the time no other directors were appointed no employees were hired mccandless did

unclear to me on what basis de vera would be qualified for the job the company apparently thinks hes qualified based on his strong contacts and relationships throughout asia though financials both mccandless and de vera do not appear to have been compensated in any way for their work mccandless cant complain though effective july   she was awarded an adjusted  million founder shares in exchange

however since october  the company stopped issuing any new shares this is quite remarkable since the company at that point still didnt have any cash available so what happened imma basically appears to have stopped doing anything at all for the fiscal year ended october   imma reported a net loss of only  considering this includes the fees from the auditor adding up to  it seems the company came to a complete halt in that light the sudden resignation of mccandless in late  as well as bringing in an inexperienced replacement seems to make more sense however communicating to the public the

volumes went up to a more healthy consistent level trading around the  level in the following months the stock price of imma kept on rising until it reached a high of  in april  immas proffensive this steady rise in share price could very well have something to do with imma becoming more active on the prfront imma announced its plans to have the streaming integration along with fully functional ecommerce capabilities entirely operational on our website by q  it also signed a financial consulting agreement with regassi management inc this company will assist imma to execute upon its overall business strategy and making introductions to investor sources that may assist the company in securing its necessary capitalization according to the press release regassi like imma incorporated on the british virgin islands has extensive experience working with publicly traded companies unfortunately my attempts to verify these claims were unsuccessful i wasnt able to find a single detail about regassi anywhere on the internet last but not least imma announced plans to hold its first launch live auction event in san josé mexico in november  it promised investors it would attract highprofile hollywood actors to become actively involved in the prepromotion and onsite marketing of the event imma promises more details within the next few weeks it is unclear how imma actually intends to pay for these celebrities stock promotion in conjunction with the sudden spark of press releases several investors reported receiving phone calls from stock promoters advertising imma click to enlarge source investorshubadvfncom also on the th of may futuremoneytrendscom started a promotional campaign click to enlarge source email futuremoneytrends futuremoneytrends disclosed receiving  dollars for its advertising of imma from a third party company the content of the email is in fact in part a wordbyword copy of the previously mentioned seeking alpha article by stone fox capital i have contacted stone fox capital about this they have no knowledge of this promotional piece and have not authorized the usage of its content website i have tried contacting imma to ask a few questions about their business model unfortunately their website is a complete mess the contact form does not work their only listed email address isnt operational either also their website contains an interactive gallery with paintings that are supposedly and contrary to what the company is communicating for sale but go nowhere when you click on them furthermore a lot of the links shown on the website are dead click to enlarge source wwwinteractiveauctioncom finally mysteriously the twitteraccount imma lists on their website does not contain their own tweets they were copied from the twitter account of art auction house christies dating back to march  the original tweet from christies the copied tweet on the immawebsite conclusion even though interactive multi media auction corporation might have started out as a genuine business idea it appears to have changed into something less genuine along the way regardless its difficult to take any company seriously that has big dreams but only appoints one director and no employees i believe the sole reason imma is currently still an active listed company is to offer an exitopportunity to existing shareholders at the expense of new investors even if the company is able to come up with some sort of an auction in mexico later this year im still very skeptical to imma ever becoming a success its not so much a problem with the business model as it is with the management implementing it unlike stone fox capital i do not believe investing in imma offers a unique investment opportunity i believe its basically flushing money down the toilet timing is everything as most investors know timing in trading is everything while researching this article i found out the same concept applies to writing articles for seeking alpha on the day i was finishing up on this article the stock price of imma came crashing down on the same day futuremoneytrends send its promotional email to its clients shares in imma closed  lower at  while i am convinced this stock will go down and eventually will fall further the extent and the timing of the dump took me by surprise the goal of this article was to warn investors not to buy into the hype surrounding this company unfortunately it appears i have been too late i have seriously considered to not submit this article as most of the damage has already been done but at the current stock price i still believe imma to be grossly overvalued also the trading volumes k on the th of may was relatively limited to what one would expect for such a price drop perhaps selling parties overestimated the effect of the futuremoneytrends article on investors and overestimated the amount of shares they were able to dump in the market perhaps several different parties all went for the exit at once considering imma itself promises investors future press releases containing names of endorsing hollywood actors this story might not be over yet for that reason i decided to publish this article anyway hopefully it will help future investors when approached by a promoter or otherwise in possible future pump promotions at the very least it will provide guidance to investors researching imma on seeking alpha beyond the previous article written by stone fox capital disclosure i am short imma through an owned entity i have no business relationship with any of the companies mentioned in this article this article is not an advice to either buy or sell it expresses my own personal opinion disclosure the author is short imma the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their own opinions the
