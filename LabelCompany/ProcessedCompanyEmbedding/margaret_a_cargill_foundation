private companies with interests in agricultural commodities food production and financial and industrial products and services ms cargill who was  when she died in  left all of her shares of cargill stock to be split between the anne ray charitable trust and the margaret a cargill foundation in eden prairie minn the amount the two nonprofits are set to receive from the bequest totals roughly billion but the way the payout is structured is complex because cargill remains a privately held company officials at the foundation and the trust could not at first liquidate the private cargill stock but that changed last year when the conglomerate sold its percent stake in a publicly traded business called the mosaic company once the company sold its stake in mosaic officials at the nonprofits were able to exchange the private cargill stock for public mosaic stock under this arrangement the foundations ended up with about  million shares of mosaic stock which will eventually provide at least billion to the trust and foundation to receive some of the bequest money right away foundation officials last year sold  million of the mosaic shares for a total of about billion the
