publishers association  norman rentrop born and raised and living year round in bonnbad godesberg germany was schooled in a jesuit school later becoming an exchange student at eton college in england and graduating from cologne university with a degree in business administration he gained journalistic experience at a school newspaper a youth magazine for bonn a local newspaper and the german stars  stripes armed forces newspaper he stated his first newsletter die geschäftsidee while he was in school with  deutschmarks earned from being a reporter for a local daily newspaper today norman rentrop publishes  newsletters looseleaf services and magazines and three directories in the fields of marketing public speaking finance investment real estate human resources taxation stocks market analysis business expansion and more founded in  verlag norman rentrop “verlag” means publishing house in german employs  people and more than  authors at its bonn headquarters and more than  people and  authors are employed worldwide verlag norman rentrop is today one of the leading information publishing companies in germany its  sales of  million deutschmarks  mio us makes it the th largest professional information company in germany to help business owners achieve their goals in life foster entrepreneurship and independence for a free and social responsible society is rentrop publishing’s mission when he began in the publishing business the german newsstands were crowded and the bookstores did not welcome newcomers norman turned to americanstyle direct marketing to grow the company npa folio and dma conferences became his training camps his training was enhanced by seminars given by visiting north american direct marketers like joan throckmorton dick benson ted nicholas ted kikoler and don hauptman “we practice what i like to call ‘consultative journalism” said rentrop “i would like for every german business owner my audience to be able to afford consulting and that’s what i give them through my newsletters i think of information products as the ability to multiply ideas over the printing press and electronically” norman is famous for inviting american publishers to tour his operations in bonn and reciprocally visiting us publishing operations “by exchanging ideas and comparing how we do in different areas we can all optimize our publishing successes” “his case studies of actual successes and failures presented at npa special publishers conferences are very remembered of” says npa executive director patti wysocki verlag norman rentrop spends a lot of money on developing people and new products there is a heavy emphasis on investing in people they budget one month’s salary for training each year per employee his company sent  employees to the npa international newsletter conference last june – from germany they also budget between  –  on books magazines newsletters and other information products which averages  per employee in addition to the one month’s salary for training “my philosophy is that if you give you will receive” said norman “i invest in my people and they will work hard for me in return and help to grow my company” back in  verlag norman rentrop was one of the very first german publishing companies to introduce profit center managers – the concept of intrapreneurs “by empowering my profit center managers to make all the decisions as if it were their own company and incentivising them by phantom stock my people love the system for the freedom and i can concentrate on the big picture” on a recent business trip to the us norman dropped in at a barnes  noble bookstore he looked at about  books and bought  books that he had shipped to germany “what more could you ask for” said norman “all the books you could possibly want and nice chairs and food too” although norman does enjoy visiting bookstores he also buys books at amazoncom on the internet new product development and the ability to see a need in the market is one of norman’s favorite parts of the newsletter business he spent  with amazoncom last year on books to research new product ideas “i love the creative process but i also love the investment process i study the lists and based on the statistical validity of a test of  names i make the determination of whether to invest in another name mailing that’s my favorite kind of investment” “why buy the cow if you want to drink a glass of milk” norman asks that explains for a lot of outsourcing at rentrop and their partnering and enjoying minority participation today norman has minority interests in companies around the world – in turkey romania poland france and the us he works with the mayo clinic letter agora georgetown publishing house the global network and garrett communications to name a few in the case of many of these relationships norman takes the us newsletter and translates it into german – both for language and cultural differences for example one newsletter has to do with etiquette while the american and german editions are similar cultural differences make it impossible to simply translate word for word for example in the united states it is customary for the gentleman to open the door to allow the woman to go ahead in germany the man goes first to thwart danger norman’s first love of the newsletter business is lists “i spend onethird of my time evaluating and cultivating mailing lists and studying srds and rate cards it requires the mindset of a good investor who can calculate chances” said norman the famous list guru dick benson once said that a publisher should spend onethird of their time on lists or media “i spend  days a year in list meetings where i meet with publishers and profitcenter managers to evaluate lists for mailings and inserts german magazines don’t rent their mailing lists but do take inserts it’s one of the most important elements of direct marketing” norman rentrop verlag norman rentrop

those of you who don’t know norman the best way i can describe him is as a sponge of information norman who lives in germany has probably visited more us publishing companies than any us publisher

per month if asked who he admires norman will tell you he emulates warren buffet whereas warren buffet is a sort of contrarian on wall street norman may be a bit of a contrarian to the newsletter business while most newsletter publishers are sole owners of their publishing companies norman owns minority interests in many other companies besides his own most publishers would prefer to maintain control over their business but norman is happy to own a minority „why buy the cow if you want to dringk a glass of milk“ norman asks norman’s philosophy toward newsletter publishing is that of a shareholder let’s say you invest in  shares of one particular stock on the new york stock exchange you own a minority interest in it and your investment in the company while you expect to make money buys you little power and control you can of course show up at the shareholder’s meeting but how much effect could you expect to have today norman has minority interests in companies around the world
