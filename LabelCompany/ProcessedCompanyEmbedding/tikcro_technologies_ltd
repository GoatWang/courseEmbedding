the stimulation of self immune system in combating cancer diseases we expect our product candidate antibodies to block the ligandreceptor linkage of certain biological pathways specifically antibodies that block ctla pd and tigit and by blocking these pathways to prevent the inhibition of patients’ self immune system and its ability to attack cancerous cells this prevention is known to have positive clinical effects and to extend overall survival      copyright  tikcro ltd  legal  terms of use  all rights reserved  site by imaginet ctla antibodytikcro  tikcro ctla antibody – tikcro

ctla antibody will be investigated t cells or t lymphocytes are a type of lymphocyte a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in cellmediated immunity t lymphocytes recognize and destroy non self cells including cancer cells a natural inhibitory mechanism of binding ctla a receptor that resides on the cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls in the lymph node from its ligands cd and cd interrupts this destruction a ctla antibody which binds to the surface domain of ctla receptor and its ligands cd and cd reverse this inhibition effect over the immune system by blocking this interaction the “turningoff” of the cytotoxic reaction is reversed and allows inhibitory signal transmitted through other pathways to cause the ctls to destroy the cancer cells we plan to initially focus our pre

cancer immunotherapy using d antigen immunization technology we aim to increase the therapeutic window and the blocking functionality of cancer immune antibodies we allow for new therapeutic antibodies for immunooncology that address key limitations of existing antibody drugs and methodologies we expect to bring functional blocking antibodies with exclusive binding qualities and the ability to address discontinued epitopes qualities that are vital for cancer immune therapy handful antibodies for cancer immunotherapy have recently shown meaningful improvements in clinical efficacy in treating cancer the mechanism of action of such antibodies is based on blocking a receptor from interacting with certain ligands however these therapeutic antibodies show less than  response rate in addition certain portion of patients stop the treatment due to toxicities as such antibody bind to additional domains that trigger auto immune malignancies these toxicities limit patients’ ability to achieve the benefit of treatment we use unique d antigen design methodology to develop new antibody therapies that aim to have exclusive binding qualities over targeted domains and to block the receptorligand interaction without binding to other domains and to limit toxicity  copyright  tikcro ltd  legal  terms of use  all rights reserved  site by imaginet presentationstikcro  tikcro
