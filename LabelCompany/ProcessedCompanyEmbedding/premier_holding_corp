multiple aspects of energy efficiency gives e a competitive advantage over other singlesolution companies and provides multiple needs being met within the same client energy efficiency’s largest players grew even as the economy lagged in recent years and they show no signs of slowing down says a report distributed by the national association of energy service companies according to the report prepared by the department of energy’s lawrence berkeley national laboratory after significantly outpacing us gdp energy efficiency companies are poised to double revenues by  the report speculates that the reason that escos did so well during the economic slump is because of their business model which spares customers from making large upfront outlays for energy efficiency retrofits payment to the escos comes from the energy savings they achieve for a facility with e projects typically the cost of the project is less than what e is saving its clients allowing for immediate additional cash flow this model allows for companies to embrace energy efficiency projects without having to outlay a large capital expense in addition qualified companies are receiving tax credits utility rebates andor favorable lease terms that make their energy efficiency efforts cash positive from day one state and federal agencies are providing significant tax incentive and most local utility companies are providing rebates based on proven documented reduction solutions today’s competitive companies know that “going green” is not just beneficial to the environment and their communities – it’s also beneficial to their company’s reputation value proposition and when done right it is beneficial to their bottom line the positive cash flow characteristics combined with the incentives and tax deductions available make investments in energy efficiency one of the safest and highestyielding investments available in this and any economic climate prhl stock price  premier holding corp stock

corporation signs nonbinding loi to include tpc in larger energy rollupmarketwiredjune  reblogsharetweetsharetustin camarketwired  jun    premier holding corporation  otcqb  prhl  announces the signing of a nonbinding loi with ridgefield partners llc to participate in a newly created energy rollup prhl intends to contribute its subsidiary the power company tpc and certain other assets in exchange for an interest in a combined company that has entered into three lois prior to the loi with prhl we believe the combined company will be able to meet the listing standards of the major exchanges following consummation of the rollup we believe that the rollup of these diversified yet integrated energy companies will maximize the future value of each company and thus the combined companyprhl will receive approximately  ownership of the combined company we intend to promptly distribute a portion of these shares to our existing shareholders and then distribute the remaining shares over the course of the year following completion of the transaction allowing prhl shareholders to reap the benefits of holding shares in both premier and in the combined companythe loi contemplates that tpc a reseller of deregulated power would be combined with a licensed national energy supplier that has one of the larger footprints in the deregulated energy space this supplier has contracted with utilities in  out of the  top states for deregulated power prhl ceo randall letcavage stated in going through this process i met with some of the larger suppliers in the us and there was a tremendous interest in our subsidiary tpc as we have reported to the public in the past we believe tpc on its own has been severely undervalued  our argument to support this goes back to our record sales months and eventually selling more than  customers a month more than  customers per year and the fact that tpc has sold over  energy contracts since inception we believe that when teamed with a supplier the value of tpc could be increased significantlyletcavage continued prhl bought a supplier earlier this year to pursue our own integration as a result we uncovered an attractive opportunity to acquire additional suppliers this led us to begin talks with suppliers with as much as  in annual revenues and we came to understand our real value and how critical it is to enter the market quickly and in more states during this process we also held discussions in earnest with ridgefield  who was acquiring companies including energy suppliers  and this recently culminated in the announced loiin addition prhls other subsidiary energy efficiency experts e is expected to enter into an exclusive sales agreements with the combined company to distribute their various lines of energy efficient products and services e continues to perform well with limited manpower and we believe that es previously announced partner program will increase its operations and financial results a material advantage is that e has contracted a financing program that we believe is more competitive than anything in the industry we expect this program will allow e customers to have all of their energy efficiency products bought for them on a basis that rivals other financing structures as clients will have no equipment cost or liability for any of the equipment we believe that this process will represent a material change in the way energy efficiency is adopted and we could potentially receive a commission from all efficiency technology hvac windows water etc which is greater than just the lighting we believe we can ultimately attract much larger clients while creating more cross selling opportunitiesthe company cautions readers that this is a nonbinding loi and the transaction remains subject to shareholder approval and entry into a formal definitive agreements will have to be negotiated and signed with customary representations and warranties and closing conditions there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummatedabout premier holding corporation under the corporate motto everything energy premier is an energy holding company focused on acquiring and
