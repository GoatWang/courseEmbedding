cottrell how i learned to write like james chartrand a nonfiction writing course like no otherby elizabeth h cottrell on august   in coursestraining writing new sessions of this course have been running in early spring and early fall each year with signups usually in january or early february and august to be notified when registration is open—and to get lots of great free writing tips between now and then—get your name on the course’s email list here absolutely no obligation  in the beginning i could write i was a nutsandbolts writer for twentyfive years i did technical writing for an engineering company and medical writing for physicians for both i turned obscure terms and concepts into writing a lay person could understand subscribers found my homebusiness content valuable when i wrote for a homebased entrepreneur website at a local community foundation i became the goto person when a written piece needed just the right touch on a personal level i’ve always gotten warm feedback from my handwritten notes of thanks sympathy or encouragement i thought i was a decent writer then the blogging bug bit me i started heartspokencom and began writing about topics to teach and encourage readers to live their most wholehearted life at any age to accomplish that i needed an entirely different result i wanted to inspire and educate… …but the practical utilitarian writing of my past was too often flat—and rarely compelling i hired a proofreader karen sanderson thinking she would at least save me from embarrassing typos her first proofreading job came back covered with comments and red lines i was horrified little did i know she was an accomplished editor who believed in giving extra value by making suggestions beyond correcting mistakes as i absorbed each comment and saw how her subtle changes added kick and direction to my writing i came to a startling realization i really needed to crank my writing up a few notches i thought writing classes were just for imaginative souls who wove characters into fiction plots so i hadn’t considered there might be a writing course for bloggers or business writers i found plenty of blogs talking about blogging though i signed up for updates from men with pens and copyblogger i eagerly anticipated posts from james chartrand sonia simone brian clark and jon morrow their writing was strong and compelling they became my rock stars it never occurred to me i could learn to write like they do damn fine timing brought me a writing course on steroids the next thing i knew ah the universe is a wonderful thing i received an email from james chartrand alist blogger and founder of men with pens about her writing class called damn fine wordsthe course description said i would learn how “to create compelling engaging content… the kind of content that reaches your target market increases your readership pulls in new clients boosts your sales and brings you better success…” yowzer this looked good and that was only the beginning the course would help me smash writer’s block and teach me how to write quickly and easily on any topic regardless of my niche i’d be able to overhaul my website copy write the ebook that has eluded me and write marketing copy and newsletters like a pro but here was the clincher the course included personal coaching from james chartrand herself i couldn’t get to the signup form fast enough damn fine words delivered my classmates included bloggers entrepreneurs artists an attorney a comedian a martial arts instructor and a handwriting analyst what bound us was a commitment to becoming better communicators and by course design we learned from each other as well as from our teacher ten weeks and  valuepacked lessons later i feel like superwoman with a commanding new arsenal of writing weapons that empower me to take charge of my writing the practical immediately implementable strategies included learning to create a writing space and ritual that makes me much more productive be clearer on my goal for each piece before i even start writing develop a system for capturing ideas immediately i have filled my editorial calendar for months ahead crank out lots of “shitty first drafts” to ensure a supply of pieces that can be quickly whipped into shape when needed recognize where breaks and formatting add punch and readability spot unsupported statements in my own and others’ writing write with the reader’s needs in mind there were highs and lows to be sure i got behind in a couple of spots and i still need to practice practice practice but thanks to james
