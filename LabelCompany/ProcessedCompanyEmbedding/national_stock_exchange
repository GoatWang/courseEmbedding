nse ensured that anyone who was qualified experienced and met minimum financial requirements was allowed to trade in this context nse was ahead of its times when it separated ownership and management in the exchange under sebis supervision the price information which could earlier be accessed only by a handful of people could now be seen by a client in a remote location with the same ease the paperbased settlement was replaced by electronic depositorybased accounts and settlement of trades was always done on time one of the most critical changes was that a robust risk management system was set in place so that settlement guarantees could protect investors against broker defaults nse was also instrumental in creating the national securities depository limited nsdl which allows investors to securely hold and transfer their shares and bonds electronically it also allows investors to hold and trade in as few as one share or bond this not only made holding financial instruments convenient but more importantly eliminated the need for paper certificates and greatly reduced the incidents of forged or fake certificates and fraudulent transactions that had plagued the indian stock market the nsdls security combined with the transparency lower transaction prices and efficiency that nse offered greatly increased the attractiveness of the indian stock market to domestic and
