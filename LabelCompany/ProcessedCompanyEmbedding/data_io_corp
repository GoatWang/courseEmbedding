being manufactured today data io offers multiple solutions for the numerous types of device mix and volume usage by our customers in the various market segments and applications we work closely with leading manufacturers of programmable devices to develop our products to meet the requirements of a particular device   data io’s line of programming systems includes a broad range of products systems modules and accessories which we group into two general categories automated programming systems and nonautomated programming systems we provide automated programming systems in three categories offline inline and onboard also known as insystem programming in addition we provide device support and service on all of our products device support is a critical aspect of our business and consists of writing software algorithms for devices and developing socket adapters to hold and connect to the device for programming   within the categories of automated solutions and nonautomated systems data io targets specific solutions at specific market segments data io optimizes the solution based on the customer’s device process and business needs data io’s flagship programming platform flashcore™ has the speed and pricing to provide the best value in the industry making it the leading choice for high volume production data io technical teams work closely with semiconductor manufacturers to          actively plan for programming support of new devices and physical packages the flashcore platform is used worldwide to program nor flash devices from all providers including market leaders intel renesas spansion and toshiba data io leads the industry in providing solutions for nand flash programming from hynix micron samsung st microelectronics toshiba msystems sandisk diskonchip and others the dynamics of the flash market are changing blurring the distinction of nand and nor technologies and the emergence of converged offerings including samsung’s onenand and spansion’s ornand also supported on flashcore systems data io’s strong partnerships with leading semiconductor companies greatly enhance our ability to serve our mutual customers target customers include oems and emss of electronic consumer products like the fastgrowing portablewireless devices cellular handsets and smart appliances these applications are high volume users of programmable flash memory devices   in portable electronics products shrinking form factors are driving the shrinkage of device packages manual programming and handling of these tiny packages is increasingly impractical due to quality issues this trend toward small packages should drive demand for data io’s automated programming systems applications targeted for these tiny devices include automotive consumer appliances remote controls medical devices portablepersonal electronics pc peripherals handheld and wearable pcs gps systems telecommunications including phones and pagers security alarms and sensors tasklink® for windows provides a universal job setup tool that intuitively guides users in preparing product data files for programming tasklink is also a key element of our connected strategy leveraging network connectivity data io’s tasklink provides monitoring and control over programming systems anywhere on the network – providing global companies with greater visibility and control over remote production lines or contract manufacturing processes in late  data io provided a number of application specific software products and related hardware that were developed in response to customer requirements the value of our applicationsoftware further differentiates data io from other providers automated programming solutions   data io provides our manufacturing and programming center customers with automated programming systems solutions that include robotic handlers a variety of programmers input and output media handling such as tray stackers tubes loaders or taping and marking solutions our prolineroadrunner™ is a unique inline programming system with programming speed capability which approaches the speed at which flash devices can currently accept data many of our customers need to program flash and microcontroller devices in large quantities and very quickly prolineroadrunner mounts directly on the assembly machine in the production line siemens fuji universal panasonic and assembleon machines and delivers programmed parts from reels of blank devices to the production line in a justintime fashion our prolineroadrunner eliminates production bottlenecks associated with highdensity flash and microcontroller devices allowing last minute firmware changes and eliminating programmed part inventories ultimately streamlining and reducing the customer’s production and process costs prolineroadrunner enables customers to implement lean processes and is a key element in data io’s connected strategy allowing customers and partners to more effectively manage their firmware supply chain prolineroadrunner currently retails from  to  depending on programming capability data io’s ps family of automated programming solutions offers highly flexible solutions for offline batch programming data io can configure ps systems to support not only flash devices but also a wide variety of other devices such as microcontrollers these systems provide a number of marking labeling and inputoutput options most importantly customers can make changeovers extremely fast this feature allows the customer to rapidly respond to diverse demands with very little downtime customers can optimize the ps family systems for any job to maximize throughput and when combined with fast changeover times and high reliability provide the highest levels of output during a production shift our ps integrates the same flashcore programmer we use in our ps ps flashcore prolineroadrunner and flashpak™ and builds on our connected strategy and common architecture the ps significantly improves throughput and lowers the cost per programmed part the ps family products range in price from approximately  to    data io’s automated solutions also include the flx our desktop automated programming and handling system the flx sets a new standard in the user experience for automation programming systems its graphical user interface eliminates the issue of language usage for the operator it was designed for “plug and play” operation and is based on a highly modular architectural design the flx significantly reduces the entry point for users seeking the benefits of automation without the previously assumed need for high volume part consumption the flx family ranges in price from approximately  to    during the fourth quarter of  the company introduced the flash media duplicator flxfmd the flash media duplicator is a solution designed to support flash media that uses the sd and mmc file formats for managed nand including small format portable media cards as well as bga package versions of this technology flash media duplicator is for oem users of flash media either in embedded applications or for duplication of inbox flash cards the flxfmd ranges in price from approximately  to               nonautomated programming systems   our line of nonautomated programming systems provides solutions for both engineering and low to mediumvolume manufacturing customers nonautomated programming systems require a user to physically handle the devices being programmed these types of programmers are also sometimes referred to as “manual” or “desktop” programmers we have three families of nonautomated programmers sprint unisystem and flashpak   engineering customers typically use singlesite programming systems during the prototype phase of a new design and may purchase inexpensive systems for limited volume device needs or more expensive systems to support more complex devices or a large variety of device packages singlesite programming systems can perform programming on only one programmable device at a time   data io offers refurbished universal single socket manual programming solutions through our unisystem family of programming systems our unisite and xpi programming systems offer the highest levels of signal integrity which ensure the highest programming standards popular in military aerospace telecommunications and other mission critical applications the systems range from approximately  to    for more cost constrained or higher volume applications the sprint family of products offers excellent value for the money and versatility the sprint quad and octal programming systems offer  and  socket universal programming configurations for higher volume applications the sprint family of products range in price from under  to  for the multiple socket solutions   our highest volume manual programmer the flashpak leverages the highspeed proprietary flashcore programming technology in the prolineroadrunner system we believe flashpak starting at approximately  is the world’s fastest programming architecture limited today only by the speed at which flash devices can accept data flashpak is another key element of

builds on our connected strategy and common architecture the ps significantly improves throughput and lowers the cost per programmed part the ps family products range in price from approximately  to    in the last quarter of  the company began shipping the flx the industrys first desktop automated programming and handling system the flx sets a new standard in the user experience for automation programming systems its graphical user interface eliminates the issue of language usage for the operator it was designed for plug and play operation and is based on a highly modular architectural design the flx significantly reduces the entry point for users seeking the benefits of automation without the previously assumed need for high volume part consumption the flx family ranges in price from approximately  to    data ios imagewriter and imagewriter are our solutions for insystems programming of programmable microcontrollers and serial memory mounted on the printed circuit board these solutions are designed to be integrated into the line generally in a test fixture the primary markets for imagewriter are microcontroller applications in automotive electronics industrial automation and consumer electronics pricing for the imagewriter starts at approximately  for the first unit with most installations requiring multiple units   nonautomated programming systems   our line of nonautomated programming systems provides solutions for both engineering and low to mediumvolume manufacturing customers nonautomated programming systems require a user to physically handle the devices being programmed these types of programmers are also sometimes referred to as manual or desktop programmers we now have three families of nonautomated programmers sprint unisystem and flashpak   engineering customers typically use singlesite programming systems during the prototype phase of a new design and may purchase inexpensive systems for limited volume device needs or more expensive systems to support more complex devices or a large variety of device packages singlesite programming systems can perform programming on only one programmable device at a time   data io offers a range of high quality universal single socket manual programming solutions through our unisystem family        of programming systems our unisite and xpi programming systems offer the highest

 products  current  legacy  model   system   unifamily  mass storage module  references  external links historyedit data io was incorporated in  before the ibm pc was introduced the company developed equipment that allowed electronic designers to program the nonvolatile semiconductor devices with data stored on punched cards or asciiencoded eightlevel punched paper tape over the next three decades the company rode the nonvolatile technology wave as bipolar eprom eeprom nor flash antifuse fram and most recently nand flash devices were introduced by semiconductor vendors while not manufacturing semiconductors itself data ios business is the design and manufacture of equipment that transfers data into various nonvolatile semiconductor devices these devices commonly are flash memory microcontroller devices and programmable logic devices productsedit currentedit introduced in  data io flashcore technology is optimized for programming of nand and nor based flash devices and flash microcontrollers and is sold in flashpak pssystem flx and prolineroadrunner programmer models spanning engineering to highvolume offline and inline justintime manufacturing data io provides tasklink for windows software to set up flashcore programmers and specify data sources in addition they develop software that manages automated and remote programming secures data and manages device serialization many of these work with tasklink while others are independent software packages data io manufactures two device programmers that can accommodate dip throughhole devices the plus and the optima both are aimed at the small relatively lowcost desktop programmer engineering market legacyedit data io model b universal programmer with a unipak  model edit one of their first attempts at a universal programmer was the model  model  ttlsequencer based model  microprocessor basedand the system  introduced in the late s it utilized interchangeable device sockets and configuration plugin printedcircuit cards consisting mainly of resistors diodes and jumpers to allow reading and programming of a variety of memory devices system edit in the early s the system  series emerged the first model the a added user ram and eliminated the need for configuration cards by offering keypadprogrammable family and pinout codes to configure the programmer introduced along with the a was the unipak a large plugin adapter that featured multiple sizes of zif sockets to reduce the need for changing socket modules since the unipak was limited to dealing with memory devices an additional accessory series called the logicpak was introduced to handle programmable logic devices pals gals etc later models featured a series of fixed sockets and an interchangeable socket module in one housing memory devices up to  pins in size could be read or programmed with the simple installation of the appropriate socket module the b chassis could accommodate up to mb of user ram unifamilyedit around  data io introduced the first of the unifamily programmers in the form of the unisite this was their first engineering programmer to feature softwareprogrammable pin drivers a technology that allows any pin of the device socket to be configured through software for power ground or nearly any type of programming waveform the first model in this line the unisite featured a removable module with a single pin dip zif socket called the site and space to install optional programming adapters to the right of this dip module such modules included the setsite a module containing eight pin zif sockets to allow gang programming of up to eight identical memory devices and the chipsite an early multisocket module accommodating several sizes of plcc and soic dip packages with clamshell zif sockets the final successor to the chipsite unit was the pinsite this featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters including those for chips packaged in pga qfp tsop and many others there was even a special connection module made available which could through the pinsites base allow the unisite to serve as the programming source in automated device handlers in factory floor environments the unifamily was the first series of data ios programmers to feature a builtin user menu all the programmer required for basic operation was a dumb terminal hooked up via an rs serial port facilities were also provided for computerbased remote control via a second serial port the early unifamily all booted and ran from software stored on k floppy diskettes in the case of the unisite or on mb floppies in the case of other unifamily members this software consists of the operators menu system selftest routines and device algorithms later in production an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided see msm or mass storage module below the unisite is the only programmer that still requires true k floppies for nonmsm operation or updating the msms software without the aid of external pcbased software the unisite was the flagship model of the unifamily line selling for over  in a typical configuration and staying in active production for at least  years data io in an effort to make the unifamily line more attractive to companies with tighter budgets introduced several other programmers utilizing the same pindriver technology as the unisite all selling for typically under  these included the model    and xpi these units varied in capability primarily in terms of the number of pin drivers the basic  featured  drivers while the xx series all had  data io developed a proprietary multiplexing scheme which allowed unifamily programmers equipped with their maximum number of hardware pin drivers to handle devices with up to  pins other differences in the series are minor models share a common base design and feature the ability to boot and run from floppy diskettes and provide an internal menu the differences are primarily in features the unisite less than a year of entering production was revised in the form of a new dip module referred to as the site this adapter had  pins in its dip socket and remained the standard for many years its successor the sitehs is functionally identical but utilizes solidstate switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the  and xx series the unisites featured k of user ram standard fieldinstallable upgrade kits consisting of a separate memory board an appropriate number of pin simms a mounting bracket and interconnecting cable were made available to upgrade these early units to mb or mb the price for the mb upgrade kit was around  in the mids these early kits required considerable labor to install including extensive disassembly of the programmer as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board in response to these difficulties as well as improvements in available technology the unisites main circuit board soon received major revisions these included the removal of most of the dipbased dram chips and the addition of two pin memory module sockets on the main board with these changes upgrading the programmers available ram became much easier requiring only the removal of the top cover installation of two simms and replacing one pal chip mass storage moduleedit the revisions to the unisite main board were done to support a new option data io created the mass storage module msm this consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive either a  inch pataide device or a pcmcia type iii card drive depending on revision level and appropriate interface circuitry all the programmers operating software and device algorithms could be transferred to the msms drive in less than a halfhour obsoleting floppy diskettes the latest revision is entirely solidstate consisting of a single large fpga chip as the boards glue logic an sprom serial programmable readonly memory chip containing the fpgas operating code a few sram chips for buffering and a solidstate or flash drive the msm remains an optional fieldinstallable module for the  and unisite unisite programmers require mb of user ram and controller board revision  or higher to utilize this option in addition the msm requires operating software revisions of  or above all  series programmers are msmcompatible at the hardware level successful installation of the msm in a  programmer automatically turns it into the model  msm adds another option a highspeed parallel port interface that supplements the programmers serial port in conjunction with a windowsbased pc and data ios tasklink software the parallel port greatly enhances the speed of data transfers to and from the programmer as one example a mb data file takes at least two minutes to be transferred into or out of a unifamily programmer via the serial port at its highest available speed  baud the same file transferred with the parallel ports help takes around – seconds any unifamily programmer with xpi after its name unisitexpi xpi already has the msm and parallel port options installed as standard equipment these

washington united states website wwwdataiocom data io corporation is a manufacturer of programming and automated device handling systems for programmable integrated circuits the company is headquartered in redmond washington with sales and engineering offices in multiple countries contents  history  products  current  legacy  model   system   unifamily  mass storage module  references  external links historyedit data io was incorporated in  before the ibm pc was introduced the company developed equipment that allowed electronic designers to program the nonvolatile semiconductor devices with data stored on punched cards or asciiencoded eightlevel punched paper tape over the next three decades the company rode the nonvolatile technology wave as bipolar eprom eeprom nor flash antifuse fram and most recently nand flash devices were introduced by semiconductor vendors while not manufacturing semiconductors itself data ios business is the design and manufacture of equipment that transfers data into various nonvolatile semiconductor devices these devices commonly are flash memory microcontroller devices and programmable logic devices productsedit currentedit introduced in  data io flashcore technology is optimized for programming of nand and nor based flash devices and flash microcontrollers and is sold in flashpak pssystem flx and prolineroadrunner programmer models spanning engineering to highvolume offline and inline justintime manufacturing data io provides tasklink for windows software to set up flashcore programmers and specify data sources in addition they develop software that manages automated and remote programming secures data and manages device serialization many of these work with tasklink while others are independent software packages data io manufactures two device programmers that can accommodate dip throughhole devices the plus and the optima both are aimed at the small relatively lowcost desktop programmer engineering market legacyedit data io model b universal programmer with a unipak  model edit one of their first attempts at a universal programmer was the model  model  ttlsequencer based model  microprocessor basedand the system  introduced in the late s it utilized interchangeable device sockets and configuration plugin printedcircuit cards consisting mainly of resistors diodes and jumpers to allow reading and programming of a variety of memory devices system edit in the early s the system  series emerged the first model the a added user ram and eliminated the need for configuration cards by offering keypadprogrammable family and pinout codes to configure the programmer introduced along with the a was the unipak a large plugin adapter that featured multiple sizes of zif sockets to reduce the need for changing socket modules since the unipak was limited to dealing with memory devices an additional accessory series called the logicpak was introduced to handle programmable logic devices pals gals etc later models featured a series of fixed sockets and an interchangeable socket module in one housing memory devices up to  pins in size could be read or programmed with the simple installation of the appropriate socket module the b chassis could accommodate up to mb of user ram unifamilyedit around  data io introduced the first of the unifamily programmers in the form of the unisite this was their first engineering programmer to feature softwareprogrammable pin drivers a technology that allows any pin of the device socket to be configured through software for power ground or nearly any type of programming waveform the first model in this line the unisite featured a removable module with a single pin dip zif socket called the site and space to install optional programming adapters to the right of this dip module such modules included the setsite a module containing eight pin zif sockets to allow gang programming of up to eight identical memory devices and the chipsite an early multisocket module accommodating several sizes of plcc and soic dip packages with clamshell zif sockets the final successor to the chipsite unit was the pinsite this featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters including those for chips packaged in pga qfp tsop and many others there was even a special connection module made available which could through the pinsites base allow the unisite to serve as the programming source in automated device handlers in factory floor environments the unifamily was the first series of data ios programmers to feature a builtin user menu all the programmer required for basic operation was a dumb terminal hooked up via an rs serial port facilities were also provided for computerbased remote control via a second serial port the early unifamily all booted and ran from software stored on k floppy diskettes in the case of the unisite or on mb floppies in the case of other unifamily members this software consists of the operators menu system selftest routines and device algorithms later in production an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided see msm or mass storage module below the unisite is the only programmer that still requires true k floppies for nonmsm operation or updating the msms software without the aid of external pcbased software the unisite was the flagship model of the unifamily line selling for over  in a typical configuration and staying in active production for at least  years data io in an effort to make the unifamily line more attractive to companies with tighter budgets introduced several other programmers utilizing the same pindriver technology as the unisite all selling for typically under  these included the model    and xpi these units varied in capability primarily in terms of the number of pin drivers the basic  featured  drivers while the xx series all had  data io developed a proprietary multiplexing scheme which allowed unifamily programmers equipped with their maximum number of hardware pin drivers to handle devices with up to  pins other differences in the series are minor models share a common base design and feature the ability to boot and run from floppy diskettes and provide an internal menu the differences are primarily in features the unisite less than a year of entering production was revised in the form of a new dip module referred to as the site this adapter had  pins in its dip socket and remained the standard for many years its successor the sitehs is functionally identical but utilizes solidstate switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the  and xx series the unisites featured k of user ram standard fieldinstallable upgrade kits consisting of a separate memory board an appropriate number of pin simms a mounting bracket and interconnecting cable were made available to upgrade these early units to mb or mb the price for the mb upgrade kit was around  in the mids these early kits required considerable labor to install including extensive disassembly of the programmer as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board in response to these difficulties as well as improvements in available technology the unisites main circuit board soon received major revisions these included the removal of most of the dipbased dram chips and the addition of two pin memory module sockets on the main board with these changes upgrading the programmers available ram became much easier requiring only the removal of the top cover installation of two simms and replacing one pal chip mass storage moduleedit the revisions to the unisite main board were done to support a new option data io created the mass storage module msm this consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive either a  inch pataide device or a pcmcia type iii card drive depending on revision level and appropriate interface circuitry all the programmers operating software and device algorithms could be transferred to the msms drive in less than a halfhour obsoleting floppy diskettes the latest revision is entirely solidstate consisting of a single large fpga chip as the boards glue logic an sprom serial programmable readonly memory chip containing the fpgas operating code a few sram chips for buffering and a solidstate or flash drive the msm remains an optional fieldinstallable module for the  and unisite unisite programmers require mb of user ram and controller board revision  or higher to utilize this option in addition the msm requires operating software revisions of  or above all  series programmers are msmcompatible at the hardware level successful installation of the msm in a  programmer automatically turns it into the model  msm adds another option a highspeed parallel port interface that supplements the programmers serial port in conjunction with a windowsbased pc and data ios tasklink software the parallel port greatly enhances the speed of data transfers to and from the programmer as one example a mb data file takes at least two minutes to be transferred into or out of a unifamily programmer via the serial port at its highest available speed  baud the same file transferred with the parallel ports help takes around – seconds any unifamily programmer with xpi after its name unisitexpi xpi already has the msm and parallel port options installed as standard equipment these programmers represent the end of the unifamily line and although no longer in production are
