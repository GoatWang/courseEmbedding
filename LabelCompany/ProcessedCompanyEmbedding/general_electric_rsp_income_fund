outlook for  for more information about the performance of a particular fund please turn to your portfolio managers commentaries and the specific fund data included later on in this report market overview most investors breathed a sigh of relief when the year was finally over however their expectations entering  had been more hopeful america was dealing resolutely with the implications of  and us stock markets had rallied strongly during the th quarter of  amid signs that the economy was about to recover its lost momentum inflation was under control the federal reserve had been extraordinarily accommodative in lowering interest rates a total of eleven times and consumers seemed willing to continue to spend their money these guarded hopes for an improved investing environment were doomed to be dashed on the rocks we all confronted in  what actually happened to investment performance the year  made its disappointing contribution to the worst us equity market decline experienced since the s by delivering a third consecutive year of negative performance after plumbing the depths in early october it continued to deliver bad news by posting the worst december monthly performance since  for stocks in the dow jones industrial average and the standard  poors  index sp  and the worst december ever recorded in the nasdaqs year history of tracking technology stocks from its peak in march  to the trough of october th  the sp  index lost just over half of its value for the full year of  the sp  index lost  the dow jones industrial index slid  and nasdaq declined by  major international equity markets in europe and the far east while outperforming the usa in dollar terms also suffered a rough ride which the weakening us dollar helped to mitigate a widely followed international equity index mscieafe declined  for the year when expressed in dollar terms but actually dropped  when expressed in local currency terms in the public security markets the only positive returns were delivered by fixed income which benefited from continued low interest rates as the federal reserve bank cut shortterm rates once more to the lowest levels seen in over  years and from funds spilling out of equities into the apparently safer harbor offered by fixed income even in fixed income there were pitfalls as the number of corporate downgrades rose to new heights as many companies struggled to perform in the tough economic environment the reasons underpinning this generally dismal investment picture are many they include a relatively anemic economy which started out the year with a strong quarter slowed in the second quarter reaccelerated in the rd quarter but then fizzled in the fourth quarter consumers continued to spend and refinancing mortgages proved a more profitable way to raise cash than selling stocks but even consumers showed signs of weariness as the year came to a close businesses unimpressed with the economy and unable to get price as capacity utilization fell in tandem with rises in inventories generally stayed on the sidelines in terms of investment spending in addition to the weak economic recovery other factors weighed on the markets chief among them the increasing drumbeat of geopolitical concerns in the war against terrorism and against countries suspected of having weapons of mass destruction overlaying these issues was a slew of disclosures in the corporate world regarding accounting scandals and conflicts of interest involving several large companies their auditors and corporate executives leading to decreased confidence by investors in the quality of reported earnings of companies in general a further concern was the declining health of the pension funds of many of the nations leading companies hit by both poor returns on their funded assets and higher liabilities driven by lower interest rates market outlook looking forward we see an investing environment filled with more than the usual array of pluses and minuses on the asset side of the balance sheet the federal reserve bank has certainly been accommodative and the bush administration is proposing a fiscal stimulus spending bill in the third year of its term a time when reelection realities usually translate into better equity returns the economy continues to benefit from low inflation along with good productivity gains and visible earnings growth should underpin the mood of the market finally the sheer duration and magnitude of the bear market  pndrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd a letter from the president continued coupled with the fact that market measures such as priceearnings multiples are returning to more normal levels suggests that  may demonstrate a moderate upward bias for the year driven by positive earnings geopolitical shocks remain a wildcard that clearly could derail a fragile recovery in addition to the wellknown global trouble spots other negatives include high levels of consumer debt continued weak capital spending growing government deficits and a weakening dollar which makes the us less attractive to foreign investors we also did not encounter the type of retail market capitulation that usually heralds a bottom but this may reflect the fact that alternatives to investing in stocks were not as convincingly attractive to investors as they have been in times past fund highlights despite an extremely challenging market environment i am very pleased to report that two of your funds have generated consistent returns that stand out from their peers ge ss program mutual fund and ge ss income fund both generated performances that ranked in the top  of their lipper competitive groups for the one three five and tenyear periods ending on december   choosing the right path for your investments theres little doubt that investor attitudes and expectations are far different now from those that prevailed during the s back then year after year of doubledigit returns triggered unbridled optimism and stock markets were complacently assumed to be able to continue to deliver doubledigit positive returns as far as the eye could see since then the markets have taught a painful lesson to those who invested too aggressively or who failed to diversify their portfolios effectively where do we go from here from our perspective we are cautiously optimistic that us stocks can deliver modest positive performance in  at least partly because a fouryear streak of losses is almost unprecedented only occurring once in the th century  and once in the th century  companies have generally done a good job in managing costs and when demand ultimately recovers operating leverage should provide a welcome boost to earnings in the international arena valuations combined with historic low interest rates should provide a platform for markets to rally and continued dollar weakness would serve to enhance dollarbased returns us fixed income rates are unlikely to fall much further unless the current low inflationary environment shifts to a much more pernicious deflationary mode and accordingly fixed income returns should reflect coupon returns with little or even negative capital appreciation overall we are expecting a moderate economic recovery laced with sufficient concerns to make careful bottomup security selection of vital importance this scenario can create attractive opportunities for thoughtful investors it makes sense to assess where you stand today recalibrate your comfort level with investment risk and structure a diversified portfolio to

lipper peer group for the twelvemonth period ended december   a the ge ss program mutual fund declined  in  compared to a decline of  for the sp  benchmark the lipper peer group consisting of  large cap core funds declined  for the same period q why did the fund outperform its benchmark for the period ended december   a the portfolio outperformed the benchmark due to solid stock selection in several sectors including technology healthcare industrials energy telecommunications and utilities in most of these sectors good stock selection included avoiding many of the companies that did poorly over the period in addition to selecting companies that had better relative performance q which stocks performed well over the period a in technology the sp  benchmark holdings were down almost  while the portfolio holdings declined  relative performance in this sector was driven by better industry performance in the portfolio in several groups such as software communications equipment and computers intuit a software company best known for its tax and accounting software products was up almost  for the year in healthcare better relative performance from healthcare provider stocks such as cardinal health lincare holdings and unitedhealth group helped performance in addition several pharmaceutical holdings including johnson  johnson merck and pharmacia contributed to relative performance over the period while industrials declined more than  for the sp  several holdings in our fund including first data emerson electric general dynamics and united technologies helped this sector of the portfolio post a better relative return of  for the year energy stocks representing a largerthanaverage position in the portfolio due to improving commodity prices and positive supplydemand fundamentals finished the year with better relative performance from holdings such as encana corp burlington resources exxon nabors industries and baker hughes in the telecommunications services sector better relative performance in the diversified telecommunications and the wireless industries helped to drive a positive contribution from this area a reduced position in the utilities sector was the primary driver of performance better than the benchmark as the sector was down more than  over the year a few electric utility companies held in the portfolio including entergy exelon and constellation energy all posted positive absolute performance amid a difficult environment  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th ge ss program mutual fund q how have the accounting scandals impacted the fund a there is no question that the corporate accounting scandals have had a negative impact on investor confidence in addition to the enron debacle several other high profile scandals including potential misappropriation of company funds at tyco and possible accounting fraud at worldcom have triggered investors fears regarding us companies corporate governance is an issue of increasing importance boards of directors are being scrutinized for independence following several high profile lapses in oversight while visibility of earnings was the mantra in recent years credibility of earnings has quickly supplanted this notion the trust and confidence in standard financial information has been called into question and a number of regulatory changes appear to be in the offing the fund has not been directly affected by the accounting scandals to date the fund did not own enron or worldcom and owned a very small position in tyco that said in our due diligence process we make every attempt to assess company managements along with their balance sheets and other financial factors but it is obviously very difficult to uncover fraudulent behavior q what is your outlook for the fund a following three straight down years the market is obviously overdue for a recovery and we do expect a modest positive return as corporate earnings slowly recover later in the year uncertainty relating to terrorism and other geopolitical concerns will probably limit the upside potential of the market and result in a continuing period of above average volatility this is the kind of environment where stock selection driven by strong fundamental research should pay off by helping us generate good returns relative to our benchmark measurement

the lipper peer group consisting of  intermediate taxable bond funds returned  for the same period q how did market conditions affect fund performance over the one year period ending december   a the us economy rebounded in  from the prior years recession supported by a drop in business inventory liquidation consumer spending and a strong housing market hopes of a typical postrecession boom were undermined by a hit to investor confidence brought on by corporate malfeasance accounting scandals and rising geopolitical risks not to mention a soft labor market and a third year of negative equity returns interest rates fell significantly during the year pushing bond prices up the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note hit a year low in early october before drifting back up to end the year at  down nearly  shortterm interest rates fell further as investors preferred the safety of short maturity treasury securities over riskier assets such as equities and corporate bonds the federal reserve the fed left their target for the federal funds rate unchanged until november when the rate was  to  reflecting concern over the pace of the economic recovery high quality assets performed best in  led by commercial mortgagebacked securities up  and us treasuries returning  corporate securities were heading for a disastrous yearly performance until they rebounded strongly in november sparked in part by the feds rate cutting moves and republicans winning control of congress the credit sector suffered from a record amount of fallen angels issuers downgraded from investment grade to below investment grade several of the largest such events in history occurred last year namely worldcom qwest el paso and tyco  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th ge ss income fund q what were the primary drivers of fund performance a fund performance in  benefited primarily from favorable security selection among corporate and mortgagebacked securities our defensive and welldiversified posture within our corporate holdings given the preponderance of negative event risk last year kept us clear of many poor performing issuers and prompted us to sell out of names such as worldcom qwest and aol before their prices significantly dropped due to ratings downgrades effective positioning in collateralized mortgage obligations and certain pass through securities contributed to the performance of the funds overall position in mortgagebacked issues allocation shifts across the various sectors throughout the year also added to the funds return q what is your outlook for the fund and the bond market a over the next few quarters we look for subpar economic growth of approximately  producing single digit earnings growth continued mortgage refinancing despite high debt levels should support consumer spending but business investment is expected to remain weak although further monetary stimulus in this environment is unlikely fiscal stimulus will come in the form of tax cuts and spending primarily military although a war with iraq may dampen economic growth the extent will depend on the duration of such a conflict the biggest risk to our outlook develops if low growth depresses corporate profits making debt service more onerous leading to more cuts in employment subsequently hurting confidence and consumer spending a recession most likely would be accompanied by lower inflation if not deflation although the risk of recession or deflation is real we give it at most a moderate probability of occurrence we cannot make a convincing case that interest rates will move significantly in either direction over the near term economic recovery typically pushes yields higher however geopolitical risks war with iraq a renewed nuclear risk in north korea should help to prop up investor demand for the safety of us treasuries limiting any upward trend in their yields we therefore begin  with a neutral interest rate sensitivity in the portfolio we have lightened our exposure to mortgagebacked securities in favor of government agency debt we continue to see value in commercial mortgagebacked securities and maintain our aboveaverage position in that sector although corporate securities had a great fourth quarter we remain cautious on the sector given our outlook for subpar growth plus the added uncertainties of war as was the case last year security selection will likely be the key to the funds success  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th ge ss income fund comparison of change in value of a  investment line chart omittedplot

program disclosure statement c more information on risks this section defines important risk terms that are used in this disclosure statement in addition be aware that an investment in any one or more investment options under the program should not be considered to be a complete investment program assetbacked securities risk assetbacked securities often are subject to more rapid repayment than their stated maturity dates indicate due to changing economic conditions to maintain its position in such securities a fund may reinvest the reductions in principal amounts resulting from the prepayments yields on those reinvested amounts are subject to prevailing market rates because prepayments of principal generally increase when rates are falling a fund generally has to reinvest proceeds from prepayments at lower rates also because assetbacked securities often are secured by the loans underlying the securities a fund may lose money if there are defaults in the loans underlying the securities credit risk the price of a bond is affected by the issuers or counterpartys credit quality changes in financial condition and general economic conditions can affect the ability to honor financial obligations and therefore credit quality lower quality bonds are generally more sensitive to these changes than higher quality bonds even within securities considered investment grade differences exist in credit quality and some investment grade debt securities may have speculative characteristics a securitys price may be adversely affected by the markets opinion of the securitys credit quality level even if the issuer or counterparty has suffered no degradation in ability to honor the obligation derivative securities risk a funds use of various investment techniques may involve derivative securities such as options futures and options on futures a fund may but is not required to use derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in an underlying asset to increase returns or as part of a hedging strategy a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on a funds performance the use of derivatives is speculative and involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid subject to counterparty risk and difficult to value and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by a fund will not correlate with a funds other investments a fund may chose not to invest in derivative securities because they may not be available may be too costly to be used effectively or may be unable to be used for other reasons foreign exposure risk investing in foreign securities including depositary receipts or securities of us entities with significant foreign operations involves additional risks which can affect a funds performance foreign markets particularly emerging markets may be less liquid more volatile and subject to less government supervision than us markets there may be difficulties enforcing contractual obligations and it may take more time for transactions to clear and settle in foreign countries than in the us less information may be available about foreign issuers the costs of buying and selling foreign securities including tax brokerage and custody costs generally are higher than those involving domestic transactions the specific risks of investing in foreign securities include currency risk the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control regulations if the local currency gains strength against the us dollar the value of the foreign security increases in us dollar terms conversely if the local currency weakens against the us dollar the value of the foreign security declines in us dollar terms us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers including depositary receipts also are subject to currency risk based on their related investments politicaleconomic risk changes in economic tax or foreign investment policies government stability war or other political or economic actions may

ss program disclosure statement cial reporting standards or to other regulatory practices and requirements common to us companies high yield securities risk below investment grade securities sometimes called junk bonds are considered speculative these securities have greater risk of default than higher rated securities the market value of below investment grade securities is more sensitive to individual corporate developments and economic changes than higher rated securities the market for below investment grade securities may be less active than for higher rated securities which can adversely affect the price at which these securities may be sold less active markets may diminish a funds ability to obtain accurate market quotations when valuing the portfolio securities and calculating a funds net asset value in addition a fund may incur additional expenses if a holding defaults and a fund has to seek recovery of its principal investment below investment grade securities may also present risks based on payment expectations for example these securities may contain redemption or call provisions if an issuer exercises these provisions in a declining interest rate market the fund would have to replace the security with a lower yielding security resulting in a decreased return for investors illiquid securities risk companies with nonpublicly traded securities are not subject to disclosure and other investor protection requirements and may be less liquid than publicly traded securities illiquid securities may be difficult to resell at approximately the price they are valued in the ordinary course of business in seven days or less when investments cannot be sold readily at the desired time or price a fund may have to accept a lower price or may not be able to sell the security at all or forego other investment opportunities all of which may have an impact on the fund interest rate risk bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and decline when interest rates rise the longer the duration of a bond the more a change in interest rates affects the bonds price shortterm and longterm interest rates may not move the same amount and may not move in the same direction prepayment risk prices and yields of mortgagebacked securities assume the securities will be redeemed at a given time when interest rates decline mortgagebacked securities experience higher prepayments because the underlying mortgages are repaid earlier than expected a funds portfolio manager may be forced to invest the proceeds from prepaid mortgagebacked securities at lower rates which results in a lower return for the fund when interest rates increase mortgagebacked securities experience lower prepayments because the underlying mortgages may be repaid later than expected this typically reduces the value of the underlying securities repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements risk a fund entering into a repurchase agreement may suffer a loss if the other party to the transaction defaults on its obligations and could be delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the underlying securities the value of the underlying securities might decline while the fund seeks to assert its rights the fund could incur additional expenses in asserting its rights or may lose all or part of the income from the agreement a reverse repurchase agreement involves the risk that the market value of the securities retained by a fund may decline below the price of the securities the fund has sold but is obligated to repurchase at a higher price under the agreement restricted securities risk restricted securities including rule a securities may be subject to legal restraints on resale and therefore are typically less liquid than other securities the prices received from reselling restricted securities in privately negotiated transactions may be less than those originally paid by a fund companies whose securities are restricted are

more established companies midcap companies tend to have more narrow product lines more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies
