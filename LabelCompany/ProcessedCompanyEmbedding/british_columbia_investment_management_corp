corporation bcimc was established under the authority of the public sector pension plans act which was passed by the british columbia legislature on july   through our predecessor organization we have a long history of providing prudent funds management services the reasons for establishing bcimc as an independently managed corporation were as follows to place the investment agency at arms length from government and thereby avoid potential conflicts that can develop between governments policy decisions and the management of public sector trust funds to increase the ability of bcimcs clients to manage the agency and ensure that the corporation has the necessary resources and flexibility to meet the challenges of global fund management to provide clients the advantages of a large public sector investment manager eg increased diversification economies of scale and a costbased fee system and to ensure a strong governance framework and proper accountability to bcimcs clients eg pension
