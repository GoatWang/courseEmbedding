colonel john pemberton who was wounded in the american civil war and became addicted to morphine began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug the prototype cocacola recipe was formulated at pembertons eagle drug and chemical house a drugstore in columbus georgia originally as a coca wine he may have been inspired by the formidable success of vin mariani a french coca wine it is also worth noting that a spanish drink called kola coca was presented at a contest in philadelphia in  a year before the official birth of cocacola the patent for this spanish drink was bought by cocacola in  in  pemberton registered his french wine coca nerve tonic in  when atlanta and fulton county passed prohibition legislation pemberton responded by developing cocacola a nonalcoholic version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the united states at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health pemberton claimed cocacola cured many diseases including morphine addiction indigestion nerve disorders headaches and impotence pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on may  of the same year in the atlanta journal by  three versions of cocacola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market a copartnership had been formed on january   between pemberton and four atlanta businessmen jc mayfield ao murphey co mullahy and eh bloodworth not codified by any signed document a verbal statement given by asa candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in pembertons company as early as  john pemberton declared that the name cocacola belonged to his son charley but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula charley pembertons record of control over the cocacola name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was actually between john pembertons son charley and walker candler  co – with john pemberton acting as cosigner for his son for  down and  in  days walker candler  co obtained all of the onethird

an additional  the cocacola company in  candler set out to incorporate a second company the cocacola company the current corporation when candler had the earliest records of the cocacola company burned in  the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time after candler had gained a better foothold on cocacola in april  he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at atlantas grady hospital at the age of  in charles howard candlers  book about his father he stated on august th  he asa candler became sole proprietor of cocacola a fact which was stated on letterheads invoice blanks and advertising copy with this action on august   candlers sole control became technically all true candler had negotiated with margaret dozier and her brother woolfolk walker a full payment amounting to  which all agreed candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span by may   candler was now claiming full ownership of the cocacola beverage

signature on the  cocacola company bill of sale had been forged subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated john pembertons signature was most likely a forgery as well

were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies effectively becoming parent bottlers this contract specified that bottles would be sold at ¢ each and had no fixed duration

  ira glass said on his pri radio show this american life that tal staffers had found a recipe in everett beals recipe book reproduced in the february   issue of the atlanta journalconstitution that they believed was either pembertons original formula for cocacola or a version that he made either before or after the product hit the market in  the formula basically matched the one found in

the same as the one used in the current product use of stimulants in formula an early coca cola advertisement when launched cocacolas two key ingredients were cocaine and caffeine the cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut leading to the name cocacola the k in kola was replaced with a c for marketing purposes coca – cocaine pemberton called for five ounces of

nine milligrams of cocaine per glass for comparison a typical dose or line of cocaine is – mg in  it was removed after  instead of using fresh leaves cocacola started using spent leaves – the leftovers of the cocaineextraction process with trace levels of cocaine since then cocacola uses a cocainefree coca leaf extract prepared at a stepan company plant in maywood new jersey in the united states the stepan company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the federal government to import and process the coca plant which it obtains mainly from peru and to a lesser extent bolivia besides producing the coca flavoring agent for cocacola the stepan company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which it sells to mallinckrodt a st louis missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is

the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production

colonel john pemberton who was wounded in the american civil war and became addicted to morphine began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug the prototype cocacola recipe was formulated at pembertons eagle drug and chemical house a drugstore in columbus georgia originally as a coca wine he may have been inspired by the formidable success of vin mariani a french coca wine it is also worth noting that a spanish drink called kola coca was presented at a contest in philadelphia in  a year before the official birth of cocacola the patent for this spanish drink was bought by cocacola in  in  pemberton registered his french wine coca nerve tonic in  when atlanta and fulton county passed prohibition legislation pemberton responded by developing cocacola a nonalcoholic version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the united states at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health pemberton claimed cocacola cured many diseases including morphine addiction indigestion nerve disorders headaches and impotence pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on may  of the same year in the atlanta journal by  three versions of cocacola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market a copartnership had been formed on january   between pemberton and four atlanta businessmen jc mayfield ao murphey co mullahy and eh bloodworth not codified by any signed document a verbal statement given by asa candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in pembertons company as early as  john pemberton declared that the name cocacola belonged to his son charley but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula charley pembertons record of control over the cocacola name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was actually between john pembertons son charley and walker candler  co – with john pemberton acting as cosigner for his son for  down and  in  days walker candler  co obtained all of the onethird

an additional  the cocacola company in  candler set out to incorporate a second company the cocacola company the current corporation when candler had the earliest records of the cocacola company burned in  the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time after candler had gained a better foothold on cocacola in april  he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at atlantas grady hospital at the age of  in charles howard candlers  book about his father he stated on august th  he asa candler became sole proprietor of cocacola a fact which was stated on letterheads invoice blanks and advertising copy with this action on august   candlers sole control became technically all true candler had negotiated with margaret dozier and her brother woolfolk walker a full payment amounting to  which all agreed candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span by may   candler was now claiming full ownership of the cocacola beverage

signature on the  cocacola company bill of sale had been forged subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated john pembertons signature was most likely a forgery as well

hobbleskirt design of  now so familiar it was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from chattanooga tennessee namely benjamin f thomas and joseph b whitehead proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies effectively becoming parent bottlers this contract specified that bottles would be sold at ¢ each and had no fixed duration

the same as the one used in the current product use of stimulants in formula an early coca cola advertisement when launched cocacolas two key ingredients were cocaine and caffeine the cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut leading to the name cocacola the k in kola was replaced with a c for marketing purposes coca – cocaine pemberton called for five ounces of

nine milligrams of cocaine per glass for comparison a typical dose or line of cocaine is – mg in  it was removed after  instead of using fresh leaves cocacola started using spent leaves – the leftovers of the cocaineextraction process with trace levels of cocaine since then cocacola uses a cocainefree coca leaf extract prepared at a stepan company plant in maywood new jersey in the united states the stepan company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the federal government to import and process the coca plant which it obtains mainly from peru and to a lesser extent bolivia besides producing the coca flavoring agent for cocacola the stepan company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which it sells to mallinckrodt a st louis missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is

suppliers to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark and so shaped that even if broken a person could tell at a glance what it was chapman j root president of the root glass company of terre haute indiana turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff including company auditor t clyde edwards plant superintendent alexander samuelsson and earl r dean bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room root and his subordinates decided to base the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base making it unstable on conveyor belts dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottles middle diameter during the  bottlers convention deans contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year by  the contour bottle became the standard for the cocacola company a revised version was also patented in  because the patent office releases the patent gazette on tuesday the bottle was patented on december   and was nicknamed the christmas bottle today the contour cocacola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planeteven in the dark as a reward for his efforts dean was offered a choice between a  bonus or a lifetime job at the root glass company he chose the lifetime job and kept it until the owensillinois glass company bought out the root glass company in the mids dean went on to work in other midwestern glass factoriescitation needed one alternative depiction has raymond loewy as the inventor of the unique design but while loewy did serve as a designer of coke cans and bottles in later years he was in the french army the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the united states until  others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod but to a victorian hooped dress in  associate justice roger j traynor of the supreme court of california

version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular

participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was

forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at

were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not

the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base making it unstable on conveyor belts dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottles middle diameter during the  bottlers convention deans contour

redeemed  million tickets this cocacola advertisement from  is still displayed in minden louisiana early cocacola bottling machine at biedenharn museum and gardens in monroe louisiana confederate colonel john pemberton who was wounded in the american civil war and became addicted to morphine began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug the prototype cocacola recipe was formulated at pembertons eagle drug and chemical house a drugstore in columbus georgia originally as a coca wine he may have been inspired by the formidable success of vin mariani a french coca wine it is also worth noting that a spanish drink called kola coca was presented at a contest in philadelphia in  a year before the official birth of cocacola the patent for this spanish drink was bought by cocacola in  in  pemberton registered his french wine coca nerve tonic in  when atlanta and fulton county passed prohibition legislation pemberton responded by developing cocacola a nonalcoholic version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the united states at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health pemberton claimed cocacola cured many diseases including morphine addiction indigestion nerve disorders headaches and impotence pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on may  of the same year in the atlanta journal by  three versions of cocacola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market a copartnership had been formed on january   between pemberton and four atlanta businessmen jc mayfield ao murphey co mullahy and eh bloodworth not codified by any signed document a verbal statement given by asa candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in pembertons company as early as  john pemberton declared that the name cocacola belonged to his son charley but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula charley pembertons record of control over the cocacola name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was actually between john pembertons son charley and walker candler  co – with john pemberton acting as cosigner for his son for  down and  in  days walker candler  co obtained all of the onethird interest in the cocacola company that charley held all while charley still held on to the name after the april  deal on april   onehalf of the walkerdozier interest shares were acquired by candler for an additional  the cocacola company in  candler set out to incorporate a second company the cocacola company the current corporation when candler had the earliest records of the cocacola company burned in  the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time after candler had gained a better foothold on cocacola in april  he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at atlantas grady hospital at the age of  in charles howard candlers  book about his father he stated on august th  he asa candler became sole proprietor of cocacola a fact which was stated on letterheads invoice blanks and advertising copy with this action on august   candlers sole control became technically all true candler had negotiated with margaret dozier and her brother woolfolk walker a full payment amounting to  which all agreed candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span by may   candler was now claiming full ownership of the cocacola beverage with a total investment outlay by candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to  in  margaret dozier as coowner of the original cocacola company in  came forward to claim that her signature on the  cocacola company bill of sale had been forged subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated john pembertons signature was most likely a forgery as well which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son charley on september   cocacola co was purchased by a group of investors for  million and reincorporated the company publicly offered  shares of the company for  a share in  the cocacola company merged with two of their bottling operators owned by jtl corporation and bci holding corporation to form cocacola enterprises inc cce in december

vicksburg mississippi at the biedenharn candy company in  the proprietor of the bottling works was joseph a biedenharn the original bottles were biedenharn bottles very different from the much later hobbleskirt design of  now so familiar it was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from chattanooga tennessee namely benjamin f thomas and joseph b whitehead proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies effectively becoming parent bottlers this contract specified that bottles would be sold at ¢ each and had no fixed duration leading to the fixed price of cocacola from  to  th century the first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the cocacola drink was painted in  in cartersville georgia cola syrup was sold as an

song see coke bottle song the cocacola bottle called the contour bottle within the company was created by bottle designer earl r dean in  the cocacola company launched a competition among its bottle suppliers to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark and so shaped that even if broken a person could tell at a glance what it was chapman j root president of the root glass company of terre haute indiana turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff including company auditor t clyde edwards plant superintendent alexander samuelsson and earl r dean bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room root and his subordinates decided to base the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base making it unstable on conveyor belts dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottles middle diameter during the  bottlers convention deans contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year by  the contour bottle became the standard for the cocacola company a revised version was also patented in  because the patent office releases the patent gazette on tuesday the bottle was patented on december   and was nicknamed the christmas bottle today the contour cocacola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on

owensillinois glass company bought out the root glass company in the mids dean went on to work in other midwestern glass factoriescitation needed one alternative depiction has raymond loewy as the inventor of the unique design but while loewy did serve as a designer of coke cans and bottles in later years he was in the french army the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the

redeemed  million tickets this cocacola advertisement from  is still displayed in minden louisiana early cocacola bottling machine at biedenharn museum and gardens in monroe louisiana confederate colonel john pemberton who was wounded in the american civil war and became addicted to morphine began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug the prototype cocacola recipe was formulated at pembertons eagle drug and chemical house a drugstore in columbus georgia originally as a coca wine he may have been inspired by the formidable success of vin mariani a french coca wine it is also worth noting that a spanish drink called kola coca was presented at a contest in philadelphia in  a year before the official birth of cocacola the patent for this spanish drink was bought by cocacola in  in  pemberton registered his french wine coca nerve tonic in  when atlanta and fulton county passed prohibition legislation pemberton responded by developing cocacola a nonalcoholic version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the united states at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health pemberton claimed cocacola cured many diseases including morphine addiction indigestion nerve disorders headaches and impotence pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on may  of the same year in the atlanta journal by  three versions of cocacola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market a copartnership had been formed on january   between pemberton and four atlanta businessmen jc mayfield ao murphey co mullahy and eh bloodworth not codified by any signed document a verbal statement given by asa candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in pembertons company as early as  john pemberton declared that the name cocacola belonged to his son charley but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula charley pembertons record of control over the cocacola name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was actually between john pembertons son charley and walker candler  co – with john pemberton acting as cosigner for his son for  down and  in  days walker candler  co obtained all of the onethird interest in the cocacola company that charley held all while charley still held on to the name after the april  deal on april   onehalf of the walkerdozier interest shares were acquired by candler for an additional  the cocacola company in  candler set out to incorporate a second company the cocacola company the current corporation when candler had the earliest records of the cocacola company burned in  the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time after candler had gained a better foothold on cocacola in april  he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at atlantas grady hospital at the age of  in charles howard candlers  book about his father he stated on august th  he asa candler became sole proprietor of cocacola a fact which was stated on letterheads invoice blanks and advertising copy with this action on august   candlers sole control became technically all true candler had negotiated with margaret dozier and her brother woolfolk walker a full payment amounting to  which all agreed candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span by may   candler was now claiming full ownership of the cocacola beverage with a total investment outlay by candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to  in  margaret dozier as coowner of the original cocacola company in  came forward to claim that her signature on the  cocacola company bill of sale had been forged subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated john pembertons signature was most likely a forgery as well which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son charley on september   cocacola co was purchased by a group of investors for  million and reincorporated the company publicly offered  shares of

vicksburg mississippi at the biedenharn candy company in  the proprietor of the bottling works was joseph a biedenharn the original bottles were biedenharn bottles very different from the much later hobbleskirt design of  now so familiar it was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from chattanooga tennessee namely benjamin f thomas and joseph b whitehead proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies effectively becoming parent bottlers this contract specified that bottles would be sold at ¢ each and had no fixed duration leading to the fixed price of cocacola from  to  th century the first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the cocacola drink was painted in  in cartersville georgia cola syrup was sold as an

to change the formula of the drink with new coke followup taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of new coke to both coke and pepsi but cocacola management was unprepared for the publics nostalgia for the old drink leading to a backlash the company gave in to protests and returned to a variation of the old formula using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar as the main sweetener under the name cocacola classic on july   st century on july   it was revealed that cocacola would resume operations in iraq for the first time since the arab league boycotted the company in  in april  in canada the name cocacola classic was changed back to cocacola the word classic was removed because new coke was no longer in production eliminating the need to differentiate between the two the formula remained unchanged in january  cocacola stopped printing the word classic on the labels of usfluidounce  ml bottles sold in parts of the southeastern united states the change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the products image the word classic was removed from all cocacola products by  in november  due to a dispute over wholesale prices of cocacola

cocacola formula the exact formula of cocacolas natural flavorings but not its other ingredients which are listed on the side of the bottle or can is a trade secret the original copy of the formula

secret formula was moved from the vault at suntrust banks to a new vault containing the formula which will be on display for visitors to its world of cocacola museum in downtown atlanta cocacola museum in atlanta georgia according to snopes a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula with each executive having only half the formula however several sources state that while cocacola does have a rule restricting access to only two executives each knows the entire formula and others in addition to the prescribed duo have known the formulation process on february   ira glass said on his pri radio show this american life that tal staffers had found a recipe in everett beals recipe book reproduced in the february   issue of the atlanta journalconstitution that they believed was either pembertons original formula for cocacola or a version that he made either before or after the product hit the market in  the formula basically matched the one found in pembertons diary cocacola archivist phil mooney acknowledged that the recipe could  be a precursor to the formula used in the original  product but emphasized that pembertons original formula is not the same as the one used in the current product use of stimulants in formula an early coca cola advertisement when launched cocacolas two key ingredients were cocaine and caffeine the cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut leading to the name cocacola the k in kola was replaced with a c for marketing purposes coca – cocaine pemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup a significant dose in  candler claimed his formula altered extensively from pembertons original contained only a tenth of this amount cocacola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass for comparison a typical dose or line of cocaine is – mg in  it was removed after  instead of using fresh leaves cocacola started using spent leaves – the leftovers of the cocaineextraction process with trace levels of cocaine since then cocacola uses a cocainefree coca leaf extract prepared at a stepan company plant in maywood new jersey in the united states the stepan company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the federal government to import and process the coca plant which it obtains mainly from peru and to a lesser extent bolivia besides producing the coca flavoring agent for cocacola the stepan company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which it sells to mallinckrodt a st louis missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in the united states licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use long after the syrup had ceased to contain any significant amount of cocaine in the southeastern us dope remained a common colloquialism for cocacola and dopewagons were trucks that transported it kola nuts – caffeine kola nuts act as a flavoring and the source of caffeine in cocacola in britain for example the

states v forty barrels and twenty kegs of cocacola hoping to force cocacola to remove caffeine from its formula the case was decided in favor of cocacola subsequently in  the us pure food and drug act was amended adding caffeine to the list of habitforming and deleterious substances which must be listed on a products label cocacola contains  mg of caffeine per  fluid ounces  mg per  ml franchised production model the actual production and distribution of cocacola follows a franchising model the cocacola company only produces a syrup concentrate which it sells to bottlers throughout the world who hold cocacola franchises for one or more geographical areas the bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores vending machines restaurants and food service distributors the cocacola company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises such as cocacola enterprises cocacola amatil cocacola hellenic bottling company and cocacola femsa but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world

even if broken a person could tell at a glance what it was chapman j root president of the root glass company of terre haute indiana turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff including company auditor t clyde edwards plant superintendent alexander samuelsson and earl r dean bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room root and his subordinates decided to base the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base making it unstable on conveyor belts dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottles middle diameter during the  bottlers convention deans contour

inventor of the unique design but while loewy did serve as a designer of coke cans and bottles in later years he was in the french army the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the

colonel john pemberton who was wounded in the american civil war and became addicted to morphine began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug the prototype cocacola recipe was formulated at pembertons eagle drug and chemical house a drugstore in columbus georgia originally as a coca wine he may have been inspired by the formidable success of vin mariani a french coca wine it is also worth noting that a spanish drink called kola coca was presented at a contest in philadelphia in  a year before the official birth of cocacola the patent for this spanish drink was bought by cocacola in  in  pemberton registered his french wine coca nerve tonic in  when atlanta and fulton county passed prohibition legislation pemberton responded by developing cocacola a nonalcoholic version of french wine coca the first sales were at jacobs pharmacy in atlanta georgia on may   it was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the united states at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health pemberton claimed cocacola cured many diseases including morphine addiction indigestion nerve disorders headaches and impotence pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on may  of the same year in the atlanta journal by  three versions of cocacola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market a copartnership had been formed on january   between pemberton and four atlanta businessmen jc mayfield ao murphey co mullahy and eh bloodworth not codified by any signed document a verbal statement given by asa candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in pembertons company as early as  john pemberton declared that the name cocacola belonged to his son charley but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula charley pembertons record of control over the cocacola name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the march  cocacola company incorporation filing made in his fathers place charleys exclusive control over the coca cola name became a continual thorn in asa candlers side candlers oldest son charles howard candler authored a book in  published by emory university in this definitive biography about his father candler specifically states  on april   the young druggist asa griggs candler purchased a onethird interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as cocacola old german cocacola bottle opener the deal was actually between john pembertons son charley and walker candler  co – with john pemberton acting as cosigner for his son for  down and  in  days walker candler  co obtained all of the onethird

an additional  the cocacola company in  candler set out to incorporate a second company the cocacola company the current corporation when candler had the earliest records of the cocacola company burned in  the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time after candler had gained a better foothold on cocacola in april  he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names yum yum and koke this was while charley pemberton was selling the elixir although a cruder mixture under the name cocacola all with his fathers blessing after both names failed to catch on for candler by the middle of  the atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to cocacola and hoped he could force his two competitors walker and dozier completely out of the business as well on august   dr john stith pemberton suddenly died asa g candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole cocacola operation charley pemberton an alcoholic was the one obstacle who unnerved asa candler more than anyone else candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name cocacola from pembertons son charley right after dr pembertons death one of several stories was that candler bought the title to the name from charleys mother for  approaching her at dr pembertons funeral eventually charley pemberton was found on june   unconscious with a stick of opium by his side ten days later charley died at atlantas grady hospital at the age of  in charles howard candlers  book about his father he stated on august th  he asa candler became sole proprietor of cocacola a fact which was stated on letterheads invoice blanks and advertising copy with this action on august   candlers sole control became technically all true candler had negotiated with margaret dozier and her brother woolfolk walker a full payment amounting to  which all agreed candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span by may   candler was now claiming full ownership of the cocacola beverage with a total investment outlay by candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to  in  margaret dozier as coowner of the original cocacola company in  came forward to claim that her signature on the  cocacola company bill of sale had been forged subsequent analysis of certain similar transfer documents had also indicated john pembertons signature was most likely a forgery as well

hobbleskirt design of  now so familiar it was then a few years later that two entrepreneurs from chattanooga tennessee namely benjamin f thomas and joseph b whitehead proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar candler never collected his dollar but in  chattanooga became the site of the first cocacola bottling company candler remained very content just selling his companys syrup the loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the cocacola company for decades to come legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies effectively becoming parent bottlers this contract specified that bottles would be sold at ¢ each and had no fixed duration leading to the fixed price of cocacola from  to  th century the first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the cocacola drink was painted in  in cartersville georgia cola syrup was sold as an

museum in atlanta georgia according to snopes a popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula with each executive having only half the formula however several sources state that while cocacola does have a rule restricting access to only two executives each knows the entire formula and others in addition to the prescribed duo have known the formulation process on february   ira glass said on his pri radio show this american life that tal staffers had found a recipe in everett beals recipe book reproduced in the february   issue of the atlanta journalconstitution that they believed was either pembertons original formula for cocacola or a version that he made either before or after the product hit the market in  the formula basically matched the one found in pembertons diary cocacola archivist phil mooney acknowledged that the recipe could  be a precursor to the formula used in the original  product but emphasized that pembertons original formula is not the same as the one used in the current product use of stimulants in formula an early coca cola advertisement when launched cocacolas two key ingredients were cocaine and caffeine the cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut leading to the name cocacola the k in kola was replaced with a c for marketing purposes coca – cocaine pemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup a significant dose in  candler claimed his formula altered extensively from pembertons original contained only a tenth of this amount cocacola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass for comparison a typical dose or line of cocaine is – mg in  it was removed after  instead of using fresh leaves cocacola started using spent leaves – the leftovers of the cocaineextraction process with trace levels of cocaine since then cocacola uses a cocainefree coca leaf extract prepared at a stepan company plant in maywood new jersey in the united states the stepan company is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the federal government to import and process the coca plant which it obtains mainly from peru and to a lesser extent bolivia besides producing the coca flavoring agent for cocacola the stepan company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which it sells to mallinckrodt a st louis missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in the united states licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use long after the syrup had ceased to contain any significant amount of cocaine in the southeastern us dope remained a

production model the actual production and distribution of cocacola follows a franchising model the cocacola company only produces a syrup concentrate which it sells to bottlers throughout the world who hold cocacola franchises for one or more geographical areas the bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores vending machines restaurants and food service distributors the cocacola company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises such as cocacola enterprises cocacola amatil cocacola hellenic bottling company and cocacola femsa but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world

permitted to drink cocacola and pepsi cola the fatwa states according to the muslim hanefite shafiite etc the rule in islamic law of forbidding or allowing foods and beverages is based on the presumption that such things are permitted unless it can be shown that they are forbidden on the basis of the quran the muslim jurists stated that unless the quran specifically prohibits the consumption of a particular product it is permissible to consume another clause was discussed whereby the same rules apply if a person is unaware of the condition or ingredients of the item in

to pemberton included giving away thousands of free drink coupons and plastering the city of atlanta with publicity banners and streetcar signs contour bottle design coke bottle redirects here for the song see coke bottle song the cocacola bottle called the contour bottle within the company was created by bottle designer earl r dean in  the cocacola company launched a competition among its bottle suppliers to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark and so shaped that even if broken a person could tell at a glance what it was chapman j root president of the root glass company of terre haute indiana turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff including company auditor t clyde edwards plant superintendent alexander samuelsson and earl r dean bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room root and his subordinates decided to base the bottles design on one of the sodas two ingredients the coca leaf or the kola nut but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like dean and edwards went to the emeline fairbanks memorial library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola instead dean was inspired by a picture of the gourdshaped cocoa pod in the encyclopædia britannica dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show root he explained to root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle root gave dean his approval faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the moldmaking machinery over the next  hours dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by root the next morning dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glassmolding machinery was turned off chapman root approved the prototype bottle and a design patent was issued on the bottle in november  the prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base making it unstable on conveyor belts dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottles middle diameter during the  bottlers convention deans contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year by  the contour bottle became the standard for the cocacola company a revised version was also patented in  because the patent office releases the patent gazette on tuesday the bottle was patented on december   and was nicknamed the christmas bottle today the contour cocacola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planeteven in the dark as a reward for his efforts dean was offered a choice between a  bonus or a lifetime job at the root glass company he chose the lifetime job and kept it until the owensillinois glass company bought out the root glass company in the mids dean went on to work in other midwestern glass factoriescitation needed one alternative depiction has raymond loewy as the inventor of the unique design but while loewy did serve as a designer of coke cans and bottles in later years he was in the french army the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the united states until  others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod but to a victorian hooped dress in  associate justice roger j traynor of the supreme court of california
