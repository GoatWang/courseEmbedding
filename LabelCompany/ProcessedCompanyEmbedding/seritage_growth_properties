page tick tock says the clock  seritage growth properties nysesrg  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»tick tock says the clockmay  about seritage growth srg brad thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummarysears has a piggy bank called seritage realty group that was formed as a reit to allow the struggling department store company to monetize its vast real estate holdingsthe k question in the eyes of most real estate investors involves the timing of the eventual sears bankruptcy filing  floris van dijkumit certainly seems like seritage is a time bomb tick tick tick tock says the clockif you decide to roll the dice be prepared to lose it allaccording to haley paterson with business insider time is running out for sears nasdaqshld the business reporter recently wrote that sp global market intelligence has identified sears as the most vulnerable public retail company in the us saying it has a  chance of default with a year paterson went on to explain that this comes after sears revealed in april that it has lost its second chief financial officer in six months just as it begins talks with lender over a looming  million debt payment talk about a hot seat wait though sears has a piggy bank called seritage realty group nysesrg that was formed as a reit to allow the struggling department store company to monetize its vast real estate holdings if you may recall billionaire investor edward lambert the hedge fund titan has been working feverishly to keep sears afloat and by selling off the pieces lands end sears canada sears hometown etc he has kept the lights on at least for now seritage formed by lambert was just another outlet for sears to liquidate its real estate portfolio essentially obtaining  billion in capital for sears in return for a promise to pay in the form of a largescale saleleaseback according to reit analyst floris van dijkum with boenning and scattergood inc the k question in the eyes of most real estate investors involves the timing of the eventual sears bankruptcy filing dijkum went on to explain even sears recent sec filing has said it may not last as a going concern but clearly eddie lampert the largest shareholder and unsecured debtholder has defied expectations before so it seems that in the game of musical chairs the song is almost in the last stanza the key question for seritage property investors is whether or not there are adequate returns to compensate investors for the outsized risk according to dijkum there are shrinking options and he adds that a delayed bankruptcy scenario for sears buys seritage time to commence as many redevelopments as possible to boost third party income cautioning that with approximately  of seritage shares sold short the company could have significant potential equity demand for an equity raise as hedge funds cover their short position it certainly seems like seritage is a time bomb tick tick tick tock says the clock the looming cash squeeze in a research report dijkum suggests that seritage has a looming cash squeeze as the company continues to burn through its remaining cash before completing its existing recaptured sears space he writes the company is in a race to hasten redevelopment of former shldleased space in order to prepare for its lead tenants widely anticipated demise while management continues to deliver strong releasing spreads and attractive returns we see a looming cash shortfall without a major capital raise the recent recapture notices that top properties will require larger development capital outlays exacerbating an imminent liquidity crunch did you say liquidity crunch i thought lambert and fellow billionaire warren buffett were funding the seritage redevelopment story as i wrote in a previous article buffett is an investor in seritage he also owned tanger nyseskt at one point of time but he appears to be a passive investor lambert is kind of wearing two hats here  hes the landlord and the tenant  and he has never been a big fan of raising equity because it dilutes his ownership stake also according to dijkum seritage missed the opportunity to raise fresh equity at much higher levels investors have asked what options the company has remaining to refinance either the  million esl lamberts fund facility that matures in december or its  billion restrictive cmbs facility that matures in july of  dijkum believes management is undoubtedly trying to obtain other debt funding but banks and the capital markets appear closed for sears credit the company however could look to combine refinancing its stabilized assets with select asset sales to pay down its cmbs at the end of q seritages remaining unrestricted cash went from  million to  million during the quarter while total outstanding debt of  billion rose by  million the company has  million of cash available from its  million line  million of restricted cash including  million for environmental remediation and  million in staged drawdowns from the esl facility according to dijkum the simple math suggests approximately  million of available cash  million if we include two years of estimated free cash flow of  million with  million to spend on committed whollyowned projects dijkum points out that seritage is also doing at least nine jv projects in its ggp jv all  at roughly  million while it has newly committed to at least another  million spend on its seven recapture boxes he expects costs for the ggp jv and newly recaptured boxes could be significantly higher than these estimates so even with approximately  million of annual retained free cash the reit analyst suggests there is a looming shortfall of over  million tick tock tick tock says the clock who wants a ticking time bomb mr markets alarm clock appears to have no alarm button in other words seritage remains the only mall reit that trades at a premium to estimated nav and a massive nav relative premium i just dont get it seritage leases a majority  of its space to a junk bond tenant and mr market thinks seritage is a tiffanys  seritage trades at more than a  relative nav premium to its a mall peers even more telling seritage reported firstquarter ffo of  per share overhead costs increased by  million compared to the previous quarter while reimbursements declined by  million excluding the  million sears lease termination payment company ffo came in at  per share i get it seritage is chopping wood in an attempt to redevelop as many sears stores before the fat lady sings during the quarter the reit signed  square feet of space at  per square foot or  times rent multiple over previous rent also seritage generates around  returns on capital spent to redevelop sears recaptured space but again its a game of musical chairs and if sears files for bankruptcy seritage will have to scramble to put the wheels back on the bus as dijkum explains seritage has insufficient third party rental income to service its debt at the time sears files eddie lampert becomes part of any debt restructuring through his unsecured loan with approximately  of srg’s shares sold short the company could have significant potential equity demand for an equity raise as hedge funds cover their short position dijkum adds that large shareholder fairholme capital has continued to add to its srg position having bought over  shares since esl has distributed  million units tick tock tick tock dont be too cute i know you get tired of me saying dont get too cute but im simply trying to steer investors to safety and that means always reminding folks to protect their hardearned principal at all costs some have criticized me for not jumping on the washington prime group nysewpg bandwagon but given the continued volatility in the retail sector i am just becoming a more defensive investor most all retail reits except for srg are trading at deep discounts so when the blue light specials are flashing why not buy the best instead of the worst as i explained sears days are numbered and jc penney nysejcp is not too far behind although wpg does appear to have a wellprotected dividend a loss of rent from sears means the landlord will also have to fund taxes insurance and maintenance expenses in addition many leases have cotenant clauses so the loss of an anchor store could set off a chain reaction that could erode the margin of safety of the dividend my point is i consider srg to be highly speculative and wpg to be speculative if you decide to roll the dice be prepared to lose it all theres a reason that buffett owns shares in wpg he is rich he can afford to take a hit can you i have provided a list of mall reits based on projected ffoshare data obtained from fast graphs as you can see srgs forecasted growth is above average in  if the company can successfully execute on its development pipeline however if sears bites the dust the music could end and you could be standing with no chair tick tock says the

important thing missing in the article and i decided that instead of editing the content and changing the title it would be best to take a deeper dive into the content in hindsight i believe that if i would have included a more balanced paper some of the more loyal buffett fans would have been more forgiving as it relates to the title that i selected so hopefully the title to my article today serves a purpose  to drive page views and to clearly articulate the content that you are about to read i am in no way trying to compare my writing with the analysis of warren buffett instead i am hoping that by the time you finish reading this article you will give me the mulligan and gain better insight into why the heck did warren buffett buy seritage what is seritage seritage growth properties nysesrg is a fully integrated selfmanaged commercial real estate investment company that is focused on the management development leasing and acquisition of diversified retail real estate throughout the us at formation on july   sears holdings nasdaqshld completed a rights offering to help fund seritages  billion saleleaseback acquisition of  wholly owned properties and  joint venture properties from shld as such srgs largest tenants are sears kmart and lands end nasdaqle the subscription price for the rights offering was set at  per share and srg opened at  on its first day of trading the portfolio encompasses  million square feet of gross leasable area and all properties are owned fee simple with the exception of one wholly owned ground lease one joint venture ground lease and two joint venture leases upon acquisition of the wholly owned properties  were operated under the kmart brand  operated under the sears brand and  were leased entirely to third parties all joint venture properties were operated under the sears brand the three joint venture transactions with simon property group nysespg general growth nyseggp and macerich nysemac were completed in q prior to the seritage saleleaseback transaction a summary of the ownership structure at the time of the rights offering is shown below how safe is sears sears represents one of the most storied retailers in the us although the relevance of sears as a retailer has faded the company was the predominant retailer for the best part of the th century and amassed an immense enterprise over that time the sears story began in  when richard sears started selling watches in a minnesota train station mr sears soon after teamed up with alvah roebuck a watchmaker to publish a catalog featuring watches and jewelry the catalog quickly expanded to include as many as  pages of merchandise across all retail categories even including kits to build a home the company opened its first retail store in chicago in  and sales topped  billion in  as the preeminent retailer during the construction of many of the countrys first and best located shopping centers sears is generally well positioned in prime locations which bodes well for the real estate value of the seritage portfolio as sears expanded its robust retail operations it also invested in product development with kenmore  and craftsman  insurance with allstate  financial services with dean witter reynolds  coldwell banker  and discover  as recently as  sears was the number one retailer in the us but in the early s its retail business became a smaller part of revenues amid intensifying competition from walmart nysewmt kmart and others the company shifted its focus to its core retail business with a series of spinoffs and sales as detailed below in  kmart acquired sears for  billion and in  kmart and sears merged to form sears holding corporation the thirdlargest us retailer at that time kmart shares a similar backstory to sears as it was one of the leading retailers during the suburban big box retail revolution in the s kmart expanded rapidly through the s but succumbed to competitive pressures and filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection in  in the largest retailer bankruptcy in us history as of ye sears holdings operated  kmart stores and  sears stores of which  and  are owned by shld respectively following the seritage transaction shld continues to use its owned real estate as a source of liquidity amid flagging sales and may seek to monetize its kenmore and craftsman brands as well according to rbc capital markets sears has a greater chance of survival with a smaller footprint sears struggles as a retailer are well documented and we summarize below the rise and fall of this once dominant retailer rbc explains that sears history includes the fact that it was early and essential in the formation of both regional malls and larger community centers as such the companys sears and kmart stores are often located on some of the best infill real estate in a given submarket to that end sears has used the value of its real estate as a cash lifeline and is now using that value as a tool with seritage to try to reshape the operating platform of the retailer rbc suggests a more bullish view of sears as explained below by focusing on its core brands including kenmore and craftsman  both of which are highly regarded  and shrinking nonessential merchandise lines sears could ultimately create a stronger retail platform importantly each of the assets in the seritage portfolio has a predefined breakup plan that should provide both seritage and sears with a potential for value creation rbc suggests that srg could ultimately become the consolidator by creating a unique opportunity to repurpose largeformat retail boxes into higher uses the seritage structure as it currently stands is summarized below the balance sheet the seritage balance sheet is well positioned to support growth the company currently has only a single piece of debt a  billion mortgage loan that is crosscollateralized by the companys entire property portfolio and bears interest at libor that loan comes due in july of  but is prepayable without penalty in january of  paying off the loan today would generate  million of prepayment penalty with that level falling  millionmonth through january of  seritage also has a  million future funding facility that currently carries no balance the company does not have a line of credit nor unsecured bond ratings rbc expects seritage to replace the large mortgage with individual mortgages and perhaps a bond if the company becomes rated leading up to  overall debt is low with key debt metrics of x net debtebitda x fixedcharge coverage and  net debttotal capitalization as of q depending on the ultimate strategic design behind each redeveloped asset the company could fund future redevelopments with either asset sales or new debt and equity the most compelling catalyst seritage is primarily a development play and according to rbc the existing operating assets are sitting atop some of the best underlying land in the retail real estate world continued demand by retailers for space in the highestquality mall and community centers should drive outsized cash flow growth for this company over the next  years the redevelopment story is compelling at the asset level the heart of the seritage growth story is the companys access to a significant pipeline of redevelopments the company has the right to require sears to vacate  of the  million sf of space represented by the sears and kmart boxes in the portfolio rbc believes the company can build out the majority of this space over the next  years according to rbc the longterm portfolio development story is also appealing the companys existing portfolio includes over  acres or some  acresbox of land as a result seritage has the opportunity to reimagine its sears and kmart locations with an eye toward adding entertainment residential units office space or even hotels rbcs year timeline suggests that seritage must redevelop some  assets annually  a tall order for any regional mall company at the same time seritage is making use of joint venture partners to help drive redevelopment which could help accelerate the process rbc has modeled the year projections using the return profile that seritage expects on the first  redevelopment projects these first  projects represent properties from the middle of the companys portfolio by projecting  projects annually over  years and assuming  development returns on each site rbc estimates that srg shares could easily double in ten years buffett is no dummy now as i said at the outset my previous article was not written to insult warren buffett fans i recognize the longterm potential for seritage however i consider the security speculative assume the worst bear case  that sears goes belly up in twelve months twenty months or thirtysix months as far as im concerned the wager on seritage is whether or not sears goes bk clearly the struggling retailer has a few more levers to pull but bankruptcy is a true option seritages portfolio composition is heavily weighted towards sears holdings as a tenant  accounts for  of portfolio gla and  of portfolio abr with an additional  of abr coming from lands end a shld spinoff rbcs  forward year target for seritage is attractive and im sure buffett understands perfectly the potential for the redevelopment pipeline would i consider seritage at any price possibly but i would own shares in a speculative account with the understanding that i am taking outsized risks and that my time horizon is much longer as compared with my investment in wpg currently seritage pays an annual common dividend of share which produces a yield of  e fad payout ratio is a very low  again much lower than i would want in my core durable income portfolio the bottom line warren buffett and i are different and the most obvious being that he is an ultrahigh net worth investor and i am not the less obvious is that his time horizon is much longer and he is willing to ride out the sears drama while waiting on seritage to create value by leasing up vacant space at a much higher rent multiple as always i look forward to your comments also keep in mind i will be traveling back from nyc today

against seritage growth properties  heres why theyre not wrong the real estate investment trust is inextricably tied to sears holdings rich duprey tmfcop jul   at am it may be guilt by association but investors are betting big that real estate investment trust reit seritage growth properties nysesrg is set to fall it has one of the largest short positions as a percentage of a stocks float of any company on the nyse and one of the highest days to cover for a stock thats already fallen  this year and is down nearly  over the last  months thats an awful lot of investors thinking it may fall further but that may have more to do with the poor prospects of sears holdings nasdaqshld with which it is inextricably linked image source getty images an reit for all the wrong reasons the reit was spun off from sears in  by chairman and ceo eddie lampert to buy the stores the retailer was shedding in an attempt to stay solvent while it has a number of highprofile investors backing it including bruce berkowitz and his fairholme capital management it also managed to raise some eyebrows when warren buffett disclosed he was a significant investor after acquiring an  stake in the reit the millionshare stake was worth about  million at the time which is a seemingly small sum for the multibillionaire investor it was an odd departure nonetheless which appeared to run counter to his value investing bona fides even so since the investment was disclosed in november  buffett is still presumably sitting on a  profit more recent investors havent been so lucky and theyre not likely to see luck turn their way anytime soon having been seeded with several hundred stores from sears substantial real estate portfolio the reit collects rents from the retailer while it still occupies them or from other companies if the department store chain has abandoned them its usually better if sears doesnt occupy the space anymore because it can jack up the rents it charges to other retailers get out and stay out in an investor presentation last month seritage noted that sears pays deeply discounted rental rates of only  per square foot if it can get another retailer to occupy the space instead its able to realize rates of anywhere from  to  per square foot currently though sears occupies  of the square footage seritage leases yet because its rents are so low it accounts for only  of the annual rent the reit collects thats better than when it first started third party tenants only accounted for  of the rent on some level there could be the hope that sears goes bankrupt so it can convert more real estate to profitable usage image source getty images yet its a doubleedged sword because the state of the shopping mall is in a serious downward spiral with real estate information firm costar estimating that nearly  billion square feet of retail space will need to be rationalized over the next few years if sears were to go under and liquidate its retail space that would put a lot of inventory on the market all at once which would depress pricing and that already seems to be happening a year ago seritage reported annual rents that averaged  per square foot but that has been halved now to just  per square foot while the spread for the rent released from space previously occupied by sears had narrowed from  times to  times dumping sears properties wholesale onto the market would cause rents to crash a downward spiral but its possible that could happen sears financial condition continues to worsen and it reports ever larger losses although lampert has come up with a number of good ideas this year to try to salvage whats left of the retailer it really is too little too late there is also the possibility that investors were betting sears would go bankrupt around the first week of july lampert had sold his stores to seritage in july  and some analysts suspected he was keeping sears afloat simply to make it over that finish line as he had just enough cash on hand to reach the deadline now that the july  threshold has come and gone and sears remains operational its possible well see the short sellers cover their bets considering the condition of the retailer though theres still good reason to believe seritage growth properties own finances wont markedly improve in the near future rich duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool

investment trust is inextricably tied to sears holdings rich duprey tmfcop jul   at am it may be guilt by association but investors are betting big that real estate investment trust reit seritage growth properties nysesrg is set to fall it has one of the largest short positions as a percentage of a stocks float of any company on the nyse and one of the highest days to cover for a stock thats already fallen  this year and is down nearly  over the last  months thats an awful lot of investors thinking it may fall further but that may have more to do with the poor prospects of sears holdings nasdaqshld with which it is inextricably linked image source getty images an reit for all the wrong reasons the reit was spun off from sears in  by chairman and ceo eddie lampert to buy the stores the retailer was shedding in an attempt to stay solvent while it has a number of highprofile investors backing it including bruce berkowitz and his fairholme capital management it also managed to raise some eyebrows when warren buffett disclosed he was a significant investor after acquiring an  stake in the reit the millionshare stake was worth about  million at the time which is a seemingly small sum for the multibillionaire investor it was an odd departure nonetheless which appeared to run counter to his value investing bona fides even so since the investment was disclosed in november  buffett is still presumably sitting on a  profit more recent investors havent been so lucky and theyre not likely to see luck turn their way anytime soon having been seeded with several hundred stores from sears substantial real estate portfolio the reit collects rents from the retailer while it still occupies them or from other companies if the department store chain has abandoned them its usually better if sears doesnt occupy the space anymore because it can jack up the rents it charges to other retailers get out and stay out in an investor presentation last month seritage noted that sears pays deeply discounted rental rates of only  per square foot if it can get another retailer to occupy the space instead its able to realize rates of anywhere from  to  per square foot currently though sears occupies  of the square footage seritage leases yet because its rents are so low it accounts for only  of the annual rent the reit collects thats better than when it first started third party tenants only accounted for  of the rent on some level there could be the hope that sears goes bankrupt so it can convert more real estate to profitable usage image source getty images yet its a doubleedged sword because the state of the shopping mall is in a serious downward spiral with real estate information firm costar estimating that nearly  billion square feet of retail space will need to be rationalized over the next few years if sears were to go under and liquidate its retail space that would put a lot of inventory on the market all at once which would depress pricing and that already seems to be happening a year ago seritage reported annual rents that averaged  per square foot but that has been halved now to just  per square foot while the spread for the rent released from space previously occupied by sears had narrowed from  times to  times dumping sears properties wholesale onto the market would cause rents to crash a downward spiral but its possible that could happen sears financial condition continues to worsen and it reports ever larger losses although lampert has come up with a number of good ideas this year to try to salvage whats left of the retailer it really is too little too late there is also the possibility that investors were betting sears would go bankrupt around the first week of july lampert had sold his stores to seritage in july  and some analysts suspected he was keeping sears afloat simply to make it over that finish line as he had just enough cash on hand to reach the deadline now that the july  threshold has come and gone and sears remains operational its possible well see the short sellers cover their bets considering the condition of the retailer though theres still good reason to believe seritage growth properties own
