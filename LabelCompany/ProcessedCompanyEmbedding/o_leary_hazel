fisk university president hazel r o’leary to retire in december  higher education higher education news and jobs category black issuesfeaturednews  fisk university president hazel r o’leary to retire in december february     tweet by reginald stuarthazel r o’leary the embattled president of financially strapped fisk university will retire from her post in december the school said in a surprise announcement issued late friday   news of o’leary departure comes as the school manages to maintain a small solid academic program while continuing to lose enrollment and thirst for a huge infusion of money to keep its door open o’leary was appointed president of fisk in august    a member of the university’s board of trustees says the search for a successor to o’leary would begin immediately   in recent years the southern association of colleges and schools sacs increasingly expressed concern about the university’s long term viability sending one signal after another it placed the historic institution on warning status then last december placed fisk on probation   fisk has been given until this fall to file its fourth monitoring report to the sacs commission on colleges coc demonstrating sufficient financial footing to ensure its longterm financial prospects and evidence that it has a qualified leadership team in place to run the school   some critics have pointed to o’leary and her board of trustees as key reasons for the school’s troubles   sacs says it will decide at its december  meeting whether the school has made a case for removal from probation or if harsher sanctions are in order the person selected to succeed o’leary is likely to weigh heavily on the minds of sacs’ decision makers in reaching their conclusions next fall   “president o’leary stands as one of the most accomplished american women of her generation” robert w norton chairman of the fisk board of trustees is quoted as saying in a statement released by the university   “she served at fisk during a difficult time in its history including cuts in student loans a tightening of credit markets and a decline in new student enrollment” norton is quoted as saying “for eight years she has brought the needed vision leadership and stability to enhance fisk’s position as a highly ranked liberal arts university” norton says   andrew patterson vice chairman of the fisk board of trustees and chairman of its presidential search committee was quoted as saying a search for a successor to o’leary would “begin immediately to ensure a smooth transition”   early response to the announcement of o’leary’s departure was largely mute there was no comment from the school’s alumni association it has been increasingly called upon by o’leary to bring more funds to the university as other sources of money have dried up   there was no comment from fisk’s faculty senate it never took a formal vote of confidence supporting or criticizing her leadership although some of its members have complained privately over the years as the school’s other key leadership roles – provost chief financial officer and chief of development – have churned several times since o’leary assumed the presidency   the fisk statement offered a shopping list of “accomplishments” at fisk under o’leary’s tenure ranging from receipt of increased amounts of research grant funding and impressive standings of its academic programs among liberal arts schools to boosting student retention efforts   aside from norton’s mention of the decline in new student enrollment the fisk statement did not address the school’s precarious financial condition or the contentious year court battle the school has waged with various parties and the state of tennessee over the university’s proposed sale of half ownership in its treasured alfred stieglitz collection of art and photographs the collection of original paintings was given the school half a century ago by the late artist georgia o’keeffe with strict written covenants barring the sale of the collection   o’leary who inherited a school in debt and was never able to devise a successful plan for turning it around quickly embraced the school’s effort to raise money quickly by selling ownership interest in the stieglitz art and photograph collection   despite early setbacks she eventually championed a plan to sell half its ownership and partial control of the collection for  million to the new crystal bridges museum in arkansas that plan remains mired in the state’s courts with the tennessee attorney general robert cooper asserting fisk must be required to honor the intent of the donor   for more than a year a splinter group of legacy alumni upset over the proposed sale has advocated o’leary’s firing and the resignation of some trustees asserting the art sale idea is wrongheaded and little else has been done during her tenure to raise significant amounts of money or reverse the school’s enrollment decline   the alumni splinter group had no initial comment although one member echoed others interviewed in asserting o’leary should have made her departure immediate as a way of helping fisk ready itself for the next round of sacs scrutiny   “in my opinion the board of trustees must intervene now in the executive and management activities of the university…by immediately hiring competent compliance executives as other schools have done to turn things around to ensure a successful outcome in december” says fisk alum and attorney cassandra teague walker “this must be the first order of business by the trustees before anything else is done they too take responsibility for their lack of oversight” says walker noting the fisk problems “…didn’t just happen overnight”   while alumni giving is up in recent years many alumni have stopped giving to the school in protest of the art sale proposal and other potential big donors have privately moved to the sidelines pending the outcome of the art collection dispute while stating publicly the lingering poor economy has curbed their giving appetite   outside observers and fisk insiders say o’leary a fisk graduate who earned her law degree at rutgers has been a generous personal donor to fisk and its students in need by the same token what they describe as o’leary’s aversion to “begging” for money explains in large part why the university has been only marginally successful in bringing in money when compared with presidents of other schools with comparable impressive histories   several higher education observers familiar with the fisk story of the past decade say it will be hard for the university to attract the kind of president it needs to restore fisk to its black ivy league’ school standing given the institution’s plight   “a lot of people will look at the prize the fisk brand name but when they open the box” says one former fisk administrator familiar with the school’s situation referring to the daunting challenges that would face o’leary’s successor   “you’re stepping into a sea of debt” the observer says “even if you turn that art sale around as in get it finally approved by the courts you can’t get that money in the system that fast i hope our new president has a honeymoon’ ” the observer adds   in making its case nearly two years ago for monetizing the stieglitz collection of photographs and art fisk officials told a tennessee court the institution was essentially running on empty it had mortgaged all of its property used much of its endowment before o’leary became president and was running annual deficits of  million the school has not updated that assertion since that disclosure nor has it reported raising any significant amounts of money to address those major issues   the school says it needs some  million to appropriately position itself for the future and says the  million from the art collection ownership sharing agreement could serve as seed money a long promised capital campaign has yet to materialize    in the fisk statement announcing o’leary’s retirement she is quoted as saying fisk “…is in better shape than when i arrived and it will continue to enjoy a long and distinguished legacy” one response to fisk university president hazel r o’leary to retire in december wonderful article my hopes is that the new president will consider using that  million to invest in a stronger athletic program for fisk including new construction or facility renovations collaborative partnerships with vandy  tsu athleticwise and bringing the big money maker back–football rachel m j ray
