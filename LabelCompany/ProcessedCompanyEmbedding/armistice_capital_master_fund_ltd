positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

      s steven boyd exhibit b june   rajesh c shrotriya md chairman and chief executive officer spectrum pharmaceuticals inc  south eastern avenue suite  henderson nv  cc board of directors dr shrotriya i appreciate you traveling to new york to meet with me on tuesday may th and i appreciate our subsequent phone conversations however saying that the board takes its fiduciary responsibility seriously and that the company will evaluate any serious offer it receives is not good enough how does the board of directors define a serious offer after losing the sandoz litigation and deferring fusilev revenue in the first quarter earnings release the market said sppi was worth  per share even at that price  of the shares were sold short  in our meetings it became clear that you believe my reference to a  premium or  per share is too low a purchase price for the company why should your biased view outweigh an efficient market as a longterm shareholder i am positively biased too and i believe that the company will fetch more than  but i recognize that the market is the ultimate weighing machine to ignore it is both irresponsible and indefensible your bias extends beyond share ownership as discussed executive compensation at spectrum has been deplorable for more than ten years your board has ignored two consecutive negative shareholder votes on the annual say on pay not coincidentally they are overpaid too the average board member at spectrum earns nearly the same compensation as board members of eli lilly lly and merck  co mrk companies greater than x the size of sppi over the last three years spectrum board members have earned x the compensation of board members of truly comparable hematologyoncology companies such as amag pharmaceuticals amag array biopharma arry infinity pharmaceuticals infi and tg therapeutics tgtx each of these companies has a market capitalization twice as large as sppi of the seven board members at spectrum three have at one point or another had their primary income come from the company we believe all but one have worked with you in some capacity in the past two have had family members employed at the company beyond bias not one of your board members has valuation expertise not one of your board members has shepherded an exit greater than  million in fact from the dates your board members have become affiliated with public companies not including sppi through the end of may  the median share price performance of those companies is  not surprisingly they are unwilling to engage in a conversation with me about creating shareholder value armistice reiterates our request for spectrum to immediately disclose any formal or informal expressions of interest andor nonbinding offers to acquire the company we are aware of multiple parties interested in acquiring sppi some of these companies have an outward strategy to make and integrate acquisitions and have completed purchases significantly larger than sppi we request that the board of directors immediately engage a toptier investment bank and initiate a formal process to sell the company we are happy to provide any bank a list of potential suitors or to make the introductions personally i want to be clear our interest in selling the company is not driven by shortterm thinking it is the logical conclusion to years of unfulfilled promises to your credit you have amassed a collection of valuable assets however you have demonstrated an indifference to execution that puts the value of these assets at risk take folotyn as an example you made a tremendous bargain purchase of allos therapeutics alth in  at the time you projected folotyn sales could eventually reach  million alth had given guidance of  million of sales for  in spectrums hands folotyn has yet to achieve  million of annual sales you referenced combination studies with fusilev those have been cancelled due to patient preference for an oral rinse like mugard you referenced label expansion into indications like breast lung and acute lymphoblastic leukemia all no work has been done not pursuing nonsmall cell lung cancer is most disappointing given the positive proofofconcept data generated by alth look at marqibo once again you made a tremendous bargain purchase of talon therapeutics tlon once again you touted the benefits of the drug – the ability to give higher doses and the reduction of peripheral neuropathy you talked about twenty indications of use for traditional vincristine yet you have not taken any concrete steps to capture the opportunity we believe the all trial is enrolling slowly and the german nonhodgkins lymphoma nhl trial is years from completion the company seems barely aware of the  fda oncologic drugs advisory committee meeting to discuss the marqibo data then generated by inex and enzon pharmaceuticals armistice believes there is an accelerated path to nccn compendium listing your indifference to execution impairs marqibos value the elephant in the room is fusilev on february   you stated our product revenue will grow and operating income will grow…we expect yearoveryear fusilev sales to continue to grow thirteen days later on march th the company lowered its annual revenue guidance to an estimated decline of  to  you ended up delivering less than the bottom end of the range fusilev sales which you said would grow declined from  million in  to  million in  a decline of  in early  you touted zevalins growth and said you expect sales of the drug to eventually reach  million in  sales of zevalin were  million a  decline from the previous year nine months ago you said you would outlicense renazorb more than two years ago you said you were planning its phase ii program nothing has happened the apaziquone phase iii studies failed in  three years later you released the data upon reacquiring the rights to apaziquone from allergan you announced you would submit a new drug application in  more than two years later nothing has happened the list goes on and on trials are announced and never completed drugs like ozarelix and spi are highlighted and then never spoken of again the recent patent litigation on fusilev was mismanaged and immediately swept under the rug the company recently uploaded a new investor presentation in which there is no mention of sppis revenue financial position or commercial operations these are the companys most valuable assets your indifference puts their value at risk in the right hands spectrum could be transformed into an exciting pure play specialty oncology company potential acquirers have greater access to capital manufacturing  distributor synergies tax advantaged corporate structures demonstrated abilities to capture overhead synergies track records of rd success and finally investor trust they give guidance which spectrum has not done since q  and most importantly they execute against it armistice is committed to affecting change at spectrum we encourage fellow shareholders to make their voices heard we will not hesitate to nominate qualified directors to the sppi board and we are evaluating all options to ensure our requests are met for the avoidance of doubt armistice does not support a potential spinoff of the companys development stage assets nor do we support the companys commercial infrastructure being dismantled we are steadfast in our belief that the company needs to be sold immediately i welcome further discussion with you and the board sincerely steve boyd managing member armistice capital llc          ∙           fifth avenue st floor

returns” said margie lindsay editor of hedge funds review adding “the list of winners should help convince doubters that hedge funds are more than capable of producing double digit returns on a consistent basis” a portfolio consisting of the winning funds in the oneyear single manager performance categories would have returned nearly  in the  months to the end of march  – the period under
