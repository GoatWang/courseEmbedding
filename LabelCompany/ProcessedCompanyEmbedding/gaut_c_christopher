the current market conditions and outlook and talk about our plan for forum going forward and then i will turn it over to jim who will discuss our financial results and liquidity position followed by prady who will address our business improvement and operational excellence initiatives although oil prices have improved from the very low levels in the first quarter of  industry activity in q reached extremely depressed levels as evidenced by the  drop in the average north america rig count from the first quarter the low level of drilling and completions activity resulted in lower volumes for us but just a  decline in our revenue to  million in the second quarter our net loss per share was  excluding special items the steps we have taken to reduce our cost structure and improve our operating efficiency are working we continue to streamline our cost structure and as a result we were able to hold our decremental margins to just  in the second quarter with these cost and efficiency initiatives we believe we could achieve incremental margins of as much as  in the early stages of a recovery despite the very challenging environment we strengthened our financial position during the second quarter forum generated free cash flow after capital expenditures of  million during the second quarter our strong balance sheet provides us with stability but also allows us to pursue disciplined acquisition and product development strategies forums total inbound orders during the second quarter were  million a  decrease from the level in the first quarter the second quarter booktobill ratio was  for the company as a whole  for the drilling  subsea segment  for the completions segment and  for the production  infrastructure segment the rig count continued its decline during the quarter and our service company customers remained reluctant to spend on anything that is not absolutely necessary this further destocking of their inventory of consumable items should lead to pentup demand for our products in our production equipment product line orders were up  in the second quarter as operators made plans to complete their backlog of drilledbutuncompleted wells we continue to see improved quoting activity for our well side surface production equipment orders for subsea equipment were up sequentially as we received an order to supply three remotely operated vehicles for a multipurpose iceclass vessel the order includes two perry work class rov systems and one subatlantic observation class rov when oil prices approached  in the second quarter we saw an increase in inquiries as customers put drilling rigs back to work as we now look ahead to the third quarter we expect our orders to increase and our financial results to be in line with or slightly better than the second quarter level provided oil prices are not less than last quarters  average there are market indications that this historical down cycle has bottomed although the timing and pace of a true recovery are not yet clear forums strong balance sheet cash flow and leverage to north america drilling and completions consumable products and our improved cost structure and operational capability all position us well for the market upturn our plans for forum going forward are geared around preparing for the upturn as prady will describe we have our streamlined organization and facility plan in place and we have redeployed resources to emphasize business development and a focus on our early cycle businesses we are also busy working on potential acquisition opportunities that would complement and expand our existing businesses let me ask jim to take you through our financials and our balance sheet position jim james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you cris and good morning everyone i will summarize our results for the quarter comparing the second quarter  with the first quarter of  consolidated revenue of  million for the second quarter was down  sequentially in line with our expectations as global drilling and completions activity levels continues to decline our drilling  subsea segment revenue of  million was down  due to the decline in working drilling rigs and lower demand for subsea robotics and equipment the completions segment revenue of  million declined  sequentially due to lower well construction and completions activity in north america our production  infrastructure segment revenue of  million was up  on increased sales of valves to the midstream gas transmission industry partially offset by lower surface production equipment deliveries in the united states the net loss for the second quarter was  million or  per diluted share the quarter included special items totaling  million on a pretax basis the adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was  per diluted share the special items were comprised of pretax charges of  million for inventory reserves restructuring charges and other items partially offset by  million in currency translation gains our second quarter adjusted operating loss was  million excluding special items compared to an adjusted operating loss of  million from the first quarter our decremental operating margins of  for the quarter on the reduced revenue were better than our guidance of a percentage in the s are we are benefiting from our cost reduction and efficiency initiatives at these significantly lower industry activity levels our revenue is even lower than our  plan our evaluation of inventory conducted at the end of  was based on the  plan we reevaluated all of our inventories according to our excess and slowmoving policy guidelines in light of the current slower moving environment most of the  million addition to the inventory reserves is attributable to the mechanical application of this policy overlaid by management judgment where we deemed appropriate we generated  million of free cash flow in the second quarter which includes operating cash flow less capital expenditures net of ppe sales proceeds but before acquisitions our cash balances did not increase as much as this free cash flow would indicate primarily because of the impact of exchange rates at the end of the quarter on our nonus cash balances and the acquisition consideration we expect to use nonus cash to cover local costs and investments in those respective currencies and therefore there is no economic impact we have demonstrated our ability to continue to generate free cash flows throughout the downturn at these lower activity levels however we are liquidating our inventories at a slower pace and we will not have the continued benefit of reducing accounts receivable as the business stabilizes we now expect to generate about  million of free cash flow over the second half of  as activity levels pick up in the recovery we should benefit from the opportunities to sell more out of our existing inventory stock drilling  subsea recorded an adjusted operating loss of  million completions  million and production  infrastructure had adjusted operating income of  million on these extremely low plant volumes we are continuing to experience labor and overhead absorption issues but we believe that maintaining the current capability will be critical to our response to the upturn we expect incremental operating margins to be higher than normal in the early stages of the recovery as the load on our plants increases and we achieve better absorption of these costs our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was  million shares net debt at the end of the second quarter was  million bringing our debt to total capitalization ratio to  interest expense was  million in the second quarter corporate expenses were  million and we expect corporate expenses to continue to be around  million per quarter capital expenditures were  million in the quarter offset by  million in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment our  capex budget remains approximately  million which is sufficient for maintenance and select investments depreciation and amortization expense was  million in the quarter and should be similar throughout  our effective tax rate on the second quarter loss was  and our estimated annual effective tax rate is now  the higher effective tax rate is attributable to losses incurred in the us and benefited at a higher statutory rate offset by earnings outside the us taxed at lower rates for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website i will now turn the call over to prady to update you on several of our initiatives prady prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer thanks jim good morning everyone i will discuss the progress we made during the quarter in positioning forum to take advantage of a market recovery including the streamlining of our operations product development and new market penetration with the consolidation of our operations having been substantially completed by the end of first quarter we are now seeing the full benefit of our efforts in the companys second quarter results with decremental margins of  versus the previous quarter results as an example of our consolidation efforts we have now achieved an approximately  reduction in our global manufacturing footprint without sacrificing manufacturing capability and have gained similar significant efficiencies in other areas of our operations in terms of our procurement initiative we are on track for a yearend savings rate of  to  compared to  pricing levels as a result the procurement savings will be substantial enough for choosing volumes increase during the recovery and we believe there will significant additional saving opportunities in the coming years we are making good progress on lean and value engineering across the company and even at these reduced activity levels we expect significant savings in  we also continued to streamline our organization structure and have completed the consolidation of our completions segment by combining the stimulation and intervention in downhole product lines under one executive leader similar to our consolidation of the production  infrastructure segment during the first quarter we believe this new structure will provide greater focus on customer synergies and operational efficiencies in addition we have simplified and resized the organization of our subsea product line although this products line continues to execute backlog gain market share and diversifying to nonoil and gas markets we are expecting a slower recovery in this area for business which is in line with offshore market trends these initiatives will significantly reduce our permanent cost structure we expect that the benefit of the company will be magnified as activity increases positioning forum for high incremental margins in the eventual recovery now i would like to discuss our investments in the middle east our new commercial organization and product development we believe these focus areas will increase our market share and revenue i recently visited several countries in the middle east and im excited about our opportunities in the region our focus in the middle east over the next few quarters will be on evaluating and developing manufacturing operations in saudi arabia in order to allow us to localize the products and qualify them with nocs national oil companies and build our sales team in the region we believe theres an opportunity to more than double the companys market share over the next three to four years we also recently appointed an executive leader for strategic marketing and business development with responsibility across all product lines this newlycreated position will be responsible for strategic marketing and account management to improve our market share with current customers and develop new customers globally and will lead our entry into new markets another area of focus for us is new product development as the market turns and activity picks up we expect this aspect of our business to continue to be one of our predominant areas of investment we plan to introduce about  new products in  and i already introduced several new products yeartodate one example of a recently introduced product that is gaining significant interest from our customers is our innovative frac missile trailer this new trailer has a single large diameter with high pressure piping and  fewer connections these features increase reliability and durability and significantly reduce the operating cost for our customers another example is our drilling product lines  psi mud pump upgrade package that continues to gain momentum with the customers as they plan to upgrade rigs to handle longer lateral wells and higher pressures required in todays drilling environment im pleased with our teams work in all the focus areas ive discussed and believe that our efforts will help differentiate forum and significantly improve the companys market presence during the recovery now ill hand it back it to – ill now turn the call over to cris for – moderate qa c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks prady i want to recognize the entire team at forum for their hard work and determination which has allowed us to reduce our cost structure very significantly and improve our efficiency the impact of these changes is evident in our second quarter results with our excellent performance on decremental margins and continued strong cash flow forum is wellpositioned at this point in the market cycle we have much exposure to the early cycle completions business and to the upturn in north america activity we are not burdened by high exposure to the offshore deepwater market or a need to wait for the next capital build cycle i like our position at this point we will open the line for questions neesy questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question will come from the line of george oleary from tudor your line is open george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hi george george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc impressive quarterly results and the  times booktobill stood out but in your commentary highlighting the  booktobill in the completions segment was particularly interesting any incremental color on what within the completions segment was really the driver there was it more on the downhole side ie bridge plug type products or more consumable equipment associated with pressure pumping spreads just curious on what drove that impressive booktobill c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so i think the booktobill ratio was actually higher in the pressure pumping consumable as some of our customers as they talked about in our conference calls are putting some equipment back to work now they are of course very concerned about the pricing in their business and that puts a lot of information on their cash flow so theyre still cautious in their spending and holding off until they absolutely need to spend but it is a case that they have now gotten to the point where they need to – they have a stable or increasing level of activity which is going to drive more utilization and more need for replacement products but it was not just in the stimulation and intervention product line the downhole business also had a booktobill ratio in excess of  george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thats very helpful color thank you on the middle east i heard there was some interesting commentary from you prady i guess talking about breaking further into that saudi market could you discuss a little bit or help frame for us kind of what the size of that market is to you guys from a revenue or from an earnings standpoint just so we can understand how much kind of a doubling in penetration over a three to fouryear period would mean for forum prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer yeah ill talk specific to saudi george and then ill expand on the middle east region i think our focus in saudi arabia right now over the next few quarters is primarily how do we localize our manufacturing operation to take advantage of some of things which the kingdom is trying do to get some local content into saudi arabia and – which gives you also a preferential treatment from a pricing standpoint so we would like to take advantage of that and we are evaluating our options of how do we set the manufacturing operation in saudi arabia you got to go through the approval processes and all that which were going through as we speak but speaking of the region in general we expect to double our market share in the middle east i mean this year probably well do about plus million in the region in the middle east and we can easily double our market share over the next three to four years i think over the next two quarters our priorities are how do we get all the products qualified in the region through the noc process which is a pretty long process and then once the products get qualified i think well start gaining our market share and i think we can easily double our market share maybe theres more opportunity but we are evaluating as we speak we need to put a lot of boots on the ground we are working through all that as we speak george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thats really helpful color maybe if i can just sneak in one more the cost improvements in the decrementals were really solid in the second quarter and it sounds like you have the roofline situation essentially complete at this point so if i heard you right it sounded like q revenues could be sort of flattish quarteronquarter given the cost side of the equation could there be some margin improvement or were you also guiding sort of expectations at the ebitda or operating income line flattish quarteronquarter just want to make sure i have that all squared away prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer the activity level remains the way it was in the second quarter one of the things which cris talked about is as long as the oil price was at a  average and the activity remains at that level with the revenue which is what we expect to be about flattish versus second quarter we do expect to see some margin improvement in third quarter primarily because of all the cost actions weve taken and as jim mentioned we do expect our incrementals to be higher george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great that was very helpful thanks for the color guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer very good operator thank you our next question will come from the line of david anderson from barclays your line is open j david anderson  barclays capital inc hey good morning cris just getting back on that completions business can you just talk about kind of – i think most of your kind of short cycle us exposure is in that business has anything kind of changed in your outlook from the last quarter if i recall correctly youve been talking about kind of a yearend inflection point yearend kind of pick up in that has anything kind of changed in your outlook so far c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah david when we talk about our short cycle activity based businesses that are early to pick up lets not lose sight of the production equipment business within our production  infrastructure segment thats probably the first one to pick up because operators need to place the orders for that equipment in advance of bringing on a new well on production and thats why we did see a pickup a handsome pickup in orders in that product line during the second quarter and we expect that trend to continue if operators are going to complete these docks our business is kind of analogous to a well head meaning you cannot complete that well without having that well site production equipment so that was i think a bright spot in q and one we expect going forward and is an early indicator for us yes youre right about our pressure pumping consumables and other completion products but those are – dont have much – as much lead time associated with them theyre kind of bought as needed so we do expect a continued improvement in our orders there and our booktobill there during the third quarter provided more wells are being completed and this increase in frac activity this trend continues i think the other downhole products business within our completions segment which also had a good booktobill ratio in q would be another beneficiary of these as longer laterals but again it is a business thats kind of bought on an as needed basis and doesnt have a lead time associated with it so it doesnt have as much kind of advanced notice of an upturn as the production equipment does but you add those three businesses together for us and thats about  of our revenue or so j david anderson  barclays capital inc so probably a little early to call kind of the bottom in completions i guess because youre saying  just in time is kind of on the quarter so you probably cannot make that statement quite yet c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer right j david anderson  barclays capital inc okay i just have a question on the ma kind of curious as to when youre going after these smaller companies which has sort of been what youve been going after what does that competition look like how many people are showing up for these i mean i know a lot of this is tends to be kind of more conversations are not acquisitions are up for sale necessarily but im just wondering kind of what your competition looks like in some of these and how thats changed over lets say the last i dont know six months or so c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well david if you wait until the business broker or the investment bank sends out the book youre going to have a lot of competition right j david anderson  barclays capital inc right c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer so the key for us is to try to identify opportunities that are earlier staged than that were not wanting to go through that process and that takes a lot of beating the bushes and going out to meet the entrepreneurs and develop a relationship over time and many of the –  or  deals that we – completed acquisitions that weve done over the past several years have had a very long gestation period so weve got a pipeline of those that were working on and thats how we try to differentiate our story than others now thats not to say that even if weve developed a relationship that the seller is not going to want to do a market check they probably will and there will be some competition and it often involves private equity but we know how to handle that and weve been relatively successful with it were not going to win every deal you certainly – its kind of like baseball youre not going to bat more than  right and far from it but i think our batting average is decent here j david anderson  barclays capital inc i know we talked yesterday about going after smaller acquisitions and kind of building up the business that way is that a concern at all do they kind of play in a different pond than you does that alter your views at all in the ma market c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer whats small to nov is big for us still when they talk about a deal of  million being small that would be big for us so we havent done many deals of that size so yeah they are looking what they call smaller deals but those would still qualify as big deals for us its not to say that theres not the potential overlap there at the margin but – and we have crossed paths with them from time to time but the small end of their range is the big end of our range i would say j david anderson  barclays capital inc okay great thank you cris c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks david operator thank you our next question will come from the line of james west from evercore isi your line is open samantha hoh  evercore isi hey this is actually samantha hoh filling in for james so most of my questions have been addressed but i did wanted to hear more about this new mud pump upgrade package that prady introduced just kind of curious is this a strategy that you guys are – have used before to sort of go after the various trends in the longer laterals and what not and just adjusting some pieces of equipment not the whole new capital equipment but just a part that is essential that needs to be upgraded and then can you qualify just sort of how the whole upgrade work what sort of pieces are you selling in and then also what the aftermarket opportunity is going forward prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer yeah well i think thats a great question samantha as you mentioned i think the trend in the market is longer lateral walls and higher pressure as a result one of the things the drilling operators do need to position themselves for the upturn is to have higher power mud pump upgrades and we have already seen several of those orders come through and our pipeline is pretty strong as the activity picks up we expect all the drilling operators most of them will upgrade their drill rigs with the mud pump upgrades now we are already competitive on the mud pump upgrade we expect our reliability and the durability and the operating cost to be much better as a result we are gaining a lot of traction in the marketplace so for your question now samantha yes as we see the market trends we are developing a product portfolio to be aligned with those trends and another good example is if we look on the completions side we have a pretty strong portfolio of products which were going to introduce and we have already introduced in the first half and were going to further introduce in the second half the other example i talked about the missile trailer frac missile trailer is another good example where were reducing the operating cost for our customers significantly again following the same trend in the space now to answer your question on whats the market potential and where do we go from here as we talked about we are expecting about  new products to be commercialized in  we have commercialized a few already our pipeline is pretty strong theres a pretty good portfolio of products were going to introduce on the completions segment pretty much compared to  frac plugs more on the pressure pumping side the valves and seats weve reduced the operating cost significantly for our customers theyre looking for efficiency plays which reduced not only the operating cost but improves the life of the product which improves the durability and reliability in most of the product portfolio we are aligned and we are developing is in that direction c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer i will just samantha hoh  evercore isi okay c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer add on the pump upgrade that with these long laterals to drive the mud motors you need more hydraulic horsepower and theres still a substantial amount of the tier  rigs that need that  psi upgrade which involves a change out of the fluid end side of the drilling rigs mud pumps and all the associated hardware on the fluid end side and it costs several hundred thousand dollars per rig typically to do that upgrade and there is a significant aftermarket component to that that once we would do the capital side we would also be in the prime position to do the ongoing work with maintaining the mud components up on the rig associated with that higher pressure and higher working and have more intensive work that is still prevalent in many areas of the service and drilling side these days prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer and the probably the first phase of our opportunity will be north america which is where the upgrades will happen but all the international market most of the international market will also follow north america down the road which will also give us further opportunities samantha hoh  evercore isi thats really great and i was just wondering during when you – i mean well i know were still a far from being at the point where customers are probably worrying about getting the aftermarket piece reliably but is there any sort of contracts associated with that sort of like a service agreement afterwards and then is that something thats going to be booked into orders or is it just so short cycled that its just out the door the minute you get these orders c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer if youre the primary provider of the mud pump consumables for a drilling contractor theyre going to want to maintain some consistency in the consumables for the mud pumps for that rig and across their rigs so that – its more of that type of relationship than it is a contract samantha hoh  evercore isi okay great thank you so much prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer thank you samantha operator thank you our next question will come from the line of marc bianchi from cowen your line is open marc bianchi  cowen  co llc thank you c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hey marc marc bianchi  cowen  co llc maybe just – hey maybe just following up on that last line of questioning and the discussion there what do you see is the market opportunity for upgrading rigs at higher capacity mud pumps or how do we think about the addressable market there for you guys and maybe how many are you tracking in the near term as business opportunities c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well as i say there are still quite a few whether its  of the tier  rigs or not i – that might be a rough guess as to the number of tier  rigs that are out there not just working rigs but tier  rigs working and not working that are not upgraded to the  psi so there are still quite a few to do and we would have good relationships with a number of the leading drilling contractors i dont want to go into who those are and who those arent but theyre still – that is clearly a competitive need out there to do these long laterals some of the other areas for upgrades that were particularly exposed to the handling tools and of course the catwalks and everythings about walking rigs now and mobility and that is an upgrade that were doing also with our catwalks another product that were introducing is one of the i guess the largest catwalks out there and were working with a rig builder to deliver that for some new rigs as well so the catwalks is a continued strength for us both onshore and offshore both onshore on tier  drilling rigs but even down to our little tripper for the workover and well service market marc bianchi  cowen  co llc great okay okay great thanks maybe just switching over to the commentary about incremental margins of something in the  range in the recovery i think previously we talked about something in the mids there im just kind of curious is that all cost cut thats driving that and any other kind of comments you can have about sort of how youre getting that  is pretty impressive c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well the primary drivers as jim was saying is the absorption of a – the better absorption of our manufacturing costs so clearly our manufacturing plans are not busy today we are carrying a large amount of unabsorbed costs and we in other words can produce significantly more products at the same costs we have today and that leads to obviously a very high contributor to our overall margins and that would be the one big factor and then thinking about that what our incremental margins are its driven by volumes marc and were not really including the pricing recovery there so that is a different assumption and when that comes that is obviously – that would be a big adder to incremental margins when and if that comes james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer marc id like to just make sure were clear that these higher incremental margins that were talking are assetturn so the early quarters as activity improves and we see this absorption improve well seen incremental margins in that higher up to  kind of range but the range you are commenting on in the concept called highs lows is more of a steady state once weve gone through that inflection point well settle down to incrementals more in the range prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer and marc probably the other thing ill add is as the efficiency gains which is were not buying much from a material standpoint even though our savings are by the end of the year will be  to  and theres still further a lot of opportunity in the procurement front and as we have mentioned the lean savings will be very significant in  too so the efficiency gains as the activity picks up will be magnified apart from the absorption issues which cris was talking about c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah that procurement benefit will be significant marc bianchi  cowen  co llc okay thanks i guess just maybe one more on that is there a way to think about how much revenue could increase before you go back to those high s to  type range c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well we have significantly underutilized our manufacturing plan as you can imagine so i think we have some good running room here to get to fully utilization and until we can fully absorb all of our manufacturing and overhead that we have i think weve got a good running room marc its not a nearterm issue there marc bianchi  cowen  co llc okay fair enough thanks very much c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks marc operator thank you our next question will come from the line of jake lundberg from credit suisse your line is open jacob lundberg  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hey guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hi hi jake jacob lundberg  credit suisse securities usa llc broker just kind of following up on the same line of questions so i think you said in the past that in terms of manhours you were currently operating at something like  of capacity so i mean should we think that maybe revenues could quadruple from here before you would run out of that the operating leverage driving those higher amount of margins prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer i would say most of the operations are running on a reduced work schedule not at the  as you mentioned but from a people standpoint jacob theyre running at anywhere from  to  hours depending on where the plant is so i think the first phase as the market turns is to get back to the full schedule first which gives another   of – from a people standpoint and then the overtime before we start adding any people c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yes prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer from a people standpoint c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yes but i think jakes point is once we get to full schedule overtime and then staff up to fully utilize our facility yeah weve got a lot of increase in potential there so before we have to think about certainly adding roofline but thats when youre running your plant most efficiently is when youre running your first shift at  hours   hours a week and youve got a second shift then you can say that youre at an efficient production rate and gosh yeah were a long way from there jacob lundberg  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great thats really helpful and then so kind of thinking about the second half if i think rig count is up today something like  versus second quarter average or so if we were up a little more than that overall for the third quarter and then say that we sort of stay there up slightly again in the fourth quarter i mean do you think you could hit ebitda breakeven in all of the businesses by the end of the year under that scenario james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the businesses that recover early which cris has described as the production equipment product line and the completions and those businesses have been at least the completions more book and ship businesses as we see those improve were going to see the most improvement in ebitda from those product lines in the early days and id say by the end of the year we could be in a good place drilling maybe a little bit more delayed because even though rigs are going back to work theres still the destocking thats taking place and it usually takes a couple of quarters before that starts converting to orders and revenue but the other early cycle product lines should come back more quickly jacob lundberg  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great and if i could sneak one more in are you guys able to share what you think your current market share is of mud pumps in the us and maybe where you think you could bring that level to in the next cycle james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we think were probably number two or three in that space jacob lundberg  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay very helpful thanks guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer great operator thank you our next question will come from the line of martin malloy from johnson rice your line is open martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc good morning c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hey marty martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc ive got a question on the rov segment and with the technip and fmc pending merger i just wanted to maybe get your comments about how that might change the dynamics for – in the rov market maybe some of technips competitors might not want to buy rovs from them as much as they previously might be inclined to c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its a good question and we dont know the answer to it but youre pointing to the fact that one of our primary competitors in this consolidated space of building and selling rovs is fmc with their schilling brand and of course our perry brand years and years ago was owned by technip and who knows whether they want to – what their feeling is about that business on a combined basis going forward but youre raising a separate issue which is we sell our rovs to the offshore contractors technip and others and if the schilling brand of fti is owned by a competitor how does that change the feelings for some of the other customers out there about buying from a competitor its a good question dont know the answer to it but time will tell in other spaces that is often – in other sectors of the industry that is often an issue as to wed rather buy from an independent supplier rather than from a competitor and that is why forum does kind of draw a pretty bright line that we are an independent provider of manufactured products and equipment we dont compete with our customers and they can take some confidence in that martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc okay and then my second question if – i was wondering if you could maybe talk about differences in the inquiries or orders that youre seeing between the international and the us market the international market how that compares to what youre seeing in the domestic market prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer the international market has also slowed off marty same as north america depending on what the product lines are in the case of – for example the capital equipment i would say we are seeing more from the international standpoint that – in the north america but on the consumables front i think we are seeing the same pressure from the international market as we are seeing in north america now the middle east obviously is very buoyant with all the activity and the amount of investments theyre going to make in the region and thats one of the reasons why were focusing on the middle east to improve our presence and also improve our market share c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer and when youre talking about capital equipment i think youre primarily referring probably to the drilling capital equipment and we are seeing some good opportunities there in the middle east for instance martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc great thank you c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question will come from the line robin shoemaker from keybanc capital market your line is open robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc thanks cris i wanted to ask on your – going back to your incremental margin prediction how much if anything is required in terms of a pricing recovery to meet those margins i totally understand that its all about utilization of your fixed costs but have you conceded pricing in any of your product lines and does pricing recovery factor into those incrementals c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer robin we have definitely like everyone in this downturn conceded pricing no question about that our assumption is that it will not be easy to recover the pricing so that is not the basis of our feeling about the high incremental margins in the early stage of a recovery what drives that is volume better utilization of our facilities and importantly as prady pointed out the efficiencies that were gaining for example on the procurement side and the progress that prady and darin harvey and our procurement team has done a great job as we for the first time at forum have really brought kind of st century procurement methodology to bear on forum supply chain robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc right okay prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer robin over a period of time what were expecting is over the next two years even if it fall back  of the pricing the rest of it will be offset with the cost initiatives and the efficiency and we can get back the margins to about  plus robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc okay understood just a specific question on whats happening with regard to sales of fluid ends to your pressure pumping customers and some of them are talking about reactivating some fleets in response to higher demand so are you selling new kind of your  horsepower quintuplex pumps is it mainly an aftermarket business right now just wondering if you can give us an update on jmac and how you perceived the upturn that youre describing in inquiries affecting them c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah the number of power ends were starting at this point robin is low were selling some but not many because you really have to talk about a pressure pumping company wanting to bring a stacked fleet out of cold stack and put it back to work before youd be talking about really selling many power ends the fluid ends or complete pumps – the fluid ends that were selling today are primarily the replacement fluid ends when one becomes unusable out in the field now as stacked equipment goes back to work when that does happen and its not happening yet then the number of fluid ends that would be required would be substantially higher and of course as we move to higher utilization even for the fleet thats out there working today all of the pressure pumping companies are saying gosh we first like to get to full utilization of equipments in the field well that would be great from our standpoint because that means more hours on the pump per week per month which means more demand for these consumable products of treating iron and fluid adds so there would be demand – both for the – driven by how many hours the existing equipment is working but then a step change when youre talking about redeploying and reequipping a stack spread robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc yeah yeah okay good well thanks a lot cris c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer very good robin operator thank you our next question will come from the line of sean meakim from jpmorgan your line is open sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hi sean sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc i just want to touch a little bit on the valves you highlighted some strength in that business during the quarter particularly in the midstream transmission side capex budget is pretty tough there this year particularly in the early part just curious if you can give us a sense of is that just some seasonal strength could you see some good project work or just kind of typical stocking a little more detail on what was driving that opportunity prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer the midstream part of the segment at least from our standpoint has been pretty stable sean in fact we have a secured few orders in the first half of  and we expect at least based on our reports in one of the products we are commercializing in fact we just in the second quarter we commercialized a slab gate valve which is a new product for us which is a distributed valve in the midstream space and we have secured some customers already so we do expect the midstream space primarily stable for us primarily because were gaining market share in that space in the case of downstream even though its stable we are seeing a lot of pressure or market softness on the refinery side even the petrochemical part of the segment is pretty resilient c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer pretty resilient yep sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc okay and i guess on midstream i guess could you – is there any more detail about the types of customers i mean the transmission folks versus selling gas utility or anything – any more detail of how thats underlying or even on the transmission projects you find thats very stable prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer actually both on the transmission side and on the gas utility side we have secured orders in the first half of  so even though there could be market softness there we are gaining market share in both areas c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah theres the ongoing work of utilities of having to kind of rebuild their system as its quite old and unsafe and then of course there are these transmission lines trying to debottleneck this system out there and then those feeder lines going into these new all these new petrochemical plants that are being built sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you for that and then just maybe circle back on the middle east as you think about that opportunity set can you give us a sense of how the capital commitments deploy over time maybe capex or working capital how much you may need to deploy to take advantage of that opportunity prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer yeah we are not capex – most of the capex investments we make are in – are pretty small numbers so the capital investment were going to make in saudi arabia will be a small number if i have to give you a range probably i would say less than  million also significantly less than  million for sure c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its probably in the prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer probably the  million range c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yes prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer may be even less c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer lease of facility probably prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer correct c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer and move some equipment so it will be pretty insignificant actually prady iyyanki  president  chief operating officer correct but the key there is the supply chain development for us to take the benefit of the localization part of saudi arabia and what theyre looking at is not to localize the whole product but the parts of the localization of product which is assembly test and maybe painting which qualifies us from a localization standpoint to take the benefit of the localization initiative in the kingdom sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc right okay great thank you very much c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well take one more question operator thank you our final question will come from the line of john daniel from simmons  company your line is open john daniel  simmons  company international hi gentlemen thank you for fitting me in first question is just relates to the inventory writedown can you – was the  inventory work in process and just some color on the types of inventory that were impacted would be helpful james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer so john it includes the full span of inventory so the way our policy works we look at inventory as it moves and traditionally weve always looked at the way the policys been applied just look at historical movement the way weve applied it this year both midyear and at the end of the last year has been to look forward because of the severe downturn and the change in the outlook going forward weve applied that policy looking forward but it has – it does cut across all ranges of the inventory john daniel  simmons  company international okay given that the writedown is driven more by if you will the mechanical application of that policy im assuming you can still use or sell some of those products in the future and if thats the case – i mean im assuming that would lead to higher potential artificial margin improvement if you will on future sales is that right james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer so we only took  reserves on inventory that we had plans to scrap and there is some of that in the reserve that weve added and the rest weve limited it to what we felt brought the inventory down to a lower cost of market type of value so we will be watching as these inventories come out how that reserve reverses i wouldnt expect it to come back too quickly but it is fair to say that weve got inventory now what we consider to be a faircarrying value and should be reflective of market margins on a goforward basis john daniel  simmons  company international okay all right another one here for you is lets assume you have a customer that enters your restructuring process or it looks like its apparent they will be entering that process to the extent you have a receivable then at what point would you take a reserve against that james w harris  executive vice president and chief financial officer very good question so we have had heightened procedures this year for monitoring the credit that we extend to customers and have tightened that credit as weve seen customers reaching positions of potentially having to go into a restructuring so our policy does work on an aging basis but we will judgmentally – add the reserves if we think theres risk i would say given the tightness of our processes this year weve had very good fortune thus far to not have to take significant charges for bad debt reserves despite some of our customers being in difficult positions and thats been a matter of keeping receivables current and a lot of effort to make sure that the collections are taking place on a timely basis john daniel  simmons  company international okay c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer and john also some these restructurings particularly for the public companies have been restructurings debt or equity swaps but we have been able to continue business and continue to get paid john daniel  simmons  company international okay and thats – thats the reason were going down this path because theres been some speculation by the better capitalized service companies that vendors will be less likely to work with those that are distressed given their potential risk if you will of the receivables risk so since youre a vendor to these guys youre a good person to ask and it seems like this is not – youre not going to abandon your relationships with these distressed companies and in fact they might is that a fair statement youre still going to work with them and then certainly once they come out of a restructuring process c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah yeah that wouldnt be a good assumption on their part john daniel  simmons  company international okay just want to confirm that and then the last one i dont know if you would be willing to answer this one but ill ask anyways is whats the revenue opportunity for you for each  psi system upgrade c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah several hundred thousand dollars per rig john daniel  simmons  company international all right okay thanks guys thanks for your time c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks john c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well thank you very much for good questions and your attention and your interest in forum and well talk to you next quarter mark s traylor  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you neesy you can end the call operator thank you ladies and gentlemen

the call over to cris gaut our chief executive officer c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks mark good morning i will start with some highlights of our third quarter performance but i then would like to talk about our strategy going forward afterwards i will turn it over to prady who will discuss our business improvement and operational excellence initiatives and then jim will provide more detail on our financial results the unexpected  sequential decline in oil prices and lower us land rig count in the third quarter continued to put downward pressure on drilling and completion activity we have delivered much of our backlog that we had going into the downturn most of our businesses are an early cycle play on oilfield activity so given the severe decline in rig count and completions activity forums third quarter revenue of  million decreased  sequentially we earned  per share and ebitda for the third quarter was  million or  of revenue forum generated free cash flow after capital expenditures of  million during the third quarter and once again our decremental margins were less than our gross margins demonstrating the benefits of our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives with oil prices returning to levels below  we have seen a much greater reluctance by our customers to spend money although total inbound orders during the third quarter were  million a  increase from the level in the second quarter we expect a slowing trend as we near yearend the third quarter booktobill ratio was  for the company as a whole  for the drilling  subsea segment and  for the production  infrastructure segment within our drilling  subsea segment our subsea product line performed well delivering on the backlog from the record orders we received last year third quarter revenue and orders increased over the second quarter including an order we received for two newbuild rovs during the quarter moving to our production  infrastructure segment inbound orders increased by  compared to the second quarter as higher orders for our downstreamrelated products in production equipment and valves were partially offset by lower orders for our upstream products during the quarter we were pleased to announce that we were awarded a contract to engineer design and build eight edge ii desalters for egypt our valve product line continues to perform well in this market as revenue and orders improved in the third quarter due to strong demand in the downstream process sector as we look to the fourth quarter the us rig count continues to drop each week ep budgets have been exhausted customer spending momentum is slowing and we expect more yearend delivery deferrals by our customers as a result we could see our fourth quarter revenues drop to as low as  million which would be below our earnings breakeven point of about  million in revenue clearly the bottom of the rig count has been pushed out in time and will be at a lower level but we think that will occur over the next few quarters for us at forum we expect orders will improve soon after the rig count bottoms and the destocking runs its course it has been forums strategy to be an early cycle activitydriven and scalable company with a strong balance sheet and low capital intensity we have also said we will not sacrifice our ability to benefit in the upturn therefore we are shifting gears so far during this down cycle we have been scaling down operations and cutting costs in line with activity and protecting operating margins in the shortterm going forward we will focus on ensuring that we are prepared to benefit from the recovery we intend to be a leadingedge beneficiary of the upturn and gain from our early cycle exposure our emphasis will shift to competitiveness in the upturn while maintaining our strong financial position and generating cash for future flexibility we will retain our core capabilities expand our product portfolio through new product development broaden our customer base and improve customer responsiveness we will also streamline our operations and expect to deliver  million improvement in our cost structure which will increase our margins in a recovery scenario by  basis points with that let me ask prady to update you on several of these initiatives prady prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president thanks cris good morning everyone let me talk more about streamlining our operations to provide operational efficiencies and update you on our initiatives regarding new product development and expanding our customer base in terms of operational efficiencies we are streamlining into fewer manufacturing facilities and the widespread use of lean techniques will provide more efficient processes and better cycle times for example as a result of our lean initiatives in production equipment we are able to consolidate our gainesville production equipment location into other facilities we are well on our way to a  reduction of our global manufacturing footprint without sacrificing capacity and with greater efficiency we will have manufacturing centers of excellence of products and processes like machine fabrication and assembly in fewer facilities were also exploring opportunities in the areas of distributions logistics and field service and we expect to gain operational efficiencies we also see potential benefits of further integrating our product lines and we will share more details on our fourth quarter call our procurement efforts are yielding high singledigit percentage savings across our operations and reducing cycle times of our suppliers we expect all these initiatives will result in at least  million of permanent cost savings as cris mentioned in his earliest script we have commercialized several new products this year and we continue to gain momentum in our product development efforts our example – one example is our new enhanced edge ii desalter technology which was instrumental for forum winning the recently announced contract to provide eight units for egypt this technology is used for treating feedstock at higher throughput rates and downstream refinery applications this is one of the few products that will provide us the opportunity to capitalize on the reinvestment in the refining industry well also look to grow our product portfolio through acquisitions we have expanded our customer base by adding more than  new customers this year in addition we have leveraged existing relationships with strategic customers to pull through other product offerings in the forum portfolio we expect to continue to broaden our customer base through our operational initiatives new products and customer focus our team has responded decisively during this downturn by scaling down operations reducing costs and maintaining margins im confident that focusing on our efficiency initiatives expanding our product offerings growing our customer base and leveraging our balance sheet to pursue acquisitions will improve forums ability to successfully compete in a consolidated market during the recovery jim harris our cfo will now discuss the financial results jim james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you prady and good morning i will summarize our quarterly results comparing the third quarter  sequentially with the second quarter  consolidated revenue of  million for the third quarter was down  sequentially as the severe drop in oil prices from mid has continued to have a significant impact on spending by our customers across our product lines our drilling  subsea segment revenue of  million was down  on softer demand for drilling capital equipment and activitybased consumable products as a drilling activity especially in the us continued to decline throughout the quarter our subsea business had a modest increase in revenue as we continued to deliver rovs ordered in  and as we successfully delivered on recent significant project orders for our moffat subsea pipeline inspection systems and rov hot stabs our production  infrastructure segment generated revenue of  million declining  on reduced completions activity in the us land market which drove lower sales of our surface production equipment and pressure pumping consumable products partially offset by increased valve sales to the midstream and processing industries net income for the third quarter was  million including  million in translation gains on the stronger us dollar relative to the british pound and euro and  million of restructuring charges associated with actions we took in the quarter to further reduce our cost structure in the face of declining market activity in addition to our direct cost initiatives preserving our gross margins we are on track to reduce our sga by over  million on an annualized basis from our  second half run rate to right size the organization through the downturn even while continuing to make select investments in product development and systems integration operating income excluding the nonoperational items was  million down  million or  from the second quarter with decremental margins of  on the reduced revenue drilling  subsea operating income of  million was down  sequentially on the lower drilling and downhole product revenues production  infrastructure operating income of  million was down  sequentially primarily from the decreased shipments of our pressure pumping consumable products and lower demand for surface production processing equipment adjusted ebitda margins in the third quarter were  a decrease of  basis points from the prior quarter we came in at the bottom of our ebitda margin guidance range of lowtomid teens as oil prices dipped precipitously in august driving further activity decline through the quarter we have taken the necessary actions to adjust our cost base in line with our outlook for revenue which has continued to come down with the declining activity levels with many customers expecting to shut down nonessential operations through the entire holiday season on these extremely low plant volumes we are fighting against pervasive labor and overhead absorption issues due to these additional headwinds in the fourth quarter we are now expecting ebitda margins around  for the quarter as we continue to implement facility consolidations we expect to incur restructuring charges of about  million over the next two quarters threefourths of which will be noncash charges these expenses will yield recurring annual pl benefits going forward of over  million we will also continue to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles related to prior acquisitions and the inventories in light of the expected longer duration of these lower activity levels adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were  achieved on the lowerthanexpected revenue with additional cost containment measures throughout the company and the lower effective tax rates our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was  million shares net debt at the end of the third quarter was  million down  million from the second quarter as free cash flow after capital expenditures was  million in the quarter we expect good free cash flow again in the fourth quarter and in  as we achieve further reductions in inventory we paid off the balance on our  million revolver during the quarter leaving only our unsecured bonds outstanding which mature in six years our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter on a netdebt basis was  times trailing months ebitda a top priority for us remains acquisitions although with the uncertainty around the duration of this downturn we expect closing transactions will be challenging we also have  million remaining on the authorization for share repurchases interest expense was  million in the third quarter corporate expenses were  million we expect corporate expenses to be around  million in the fourth quarter now down  from  levels after implementing our cost reductions capital expenditures were  million in the quarter and  million yeartodate weve held our budget for fullyear  capital expenditures at approximately  million depreciation and amortization expense was  million for the quarter and should be approximately  million for the fullyear we lowered our estimated annual effective tax rate to  from the prior estimate of  as weve continued to see a greater decline in us profits relative to our international operations in line with a steeper decline in us activity levels as a result a higher proportion of our earnings are subject to the lower statutory tax rates and jurisdictions outside the us the  effective tax rate reported for the third quarter is attributable to catch up of the two percentage point drop in the rate applied to yeartodate earnings for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website i will now turn the call back over to cris for concluding remarks and to moderate qa c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks jim the primary driver of forums results is drilling and completion activity the downturn in this activity has been reflected in our revenue directly and in real time i believe our team has done an excellent job of managing costs down in line with falling activity and has limited the negative impact of declining revenue on our margins as we look ahead to  we believe the decline in drilling and completion activity will be bottoming out and then stabilizing which will lead to an upturn in our orders we are turning our focus to preparing for a recovery in our business and we believe we will be well positioned for this recovery due to more strong balance sheet and liquidity our free cash flow generation and the progress we have made in improving our operational efficiency given our weighting to short cycle consumable products we believe forum will be among the first to see financial results benefit from an increase in drilling and completion activity thanks for your interest and at this point we will open the line for questions nicole lets take the first question questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of blake hutchinson of howard weil your line is now open blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil good morning guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hey blake blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil first question just to kind of understand where we are baselinewise with the drilling technology subsegment given your commentary on the subsea subsegment would it be correct to assume that drilling technologies on a sequential basis was off something on the top line perhaps greater than  and was that representative primarily of the capital equipment running off or would you suggest that thats just kind of what the market is bearing right now james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president yes blake so no we werent down  it was down significantly in the quarter but not to that level and we did deliver on a lot of the capital equipment in the first half of the year so we have had fewer deliveries there and we are subject more to the lower activity levels so as we saw the rig count coming down of course that had an impact on the consumable products that we sold in the quarter and thats reflected in drilling results c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah and then first the well construction downhole products were down as well during the quarter with just fewer consumable products being sold as our customers really are trying to preserve their cash and not spend when they dont have to particularly on items that needs to be expensed blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil and maybe just sticking with this so we can kind of tuck this away for the recovery scenario over the initial part of the quarter were there portions of the order flow in your shortcycle businesses that were showing particular promise or responsiveness to what were higher price decks at the time c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well i think the main point is this blake that with the additional decline in oil prices since the end of the second quarter that was driven by concern about demand for oil that   additional decline in oil prices did change the mindset of operators service companies and drilling contractors across the board and it changed that mindset to really protecting balance sheet and cash through the downturn and not wanting to spend money where they didnt have to so i think that that trend gathered force as the oil price fell and we saw that reflected in the declining rig activity that is still going on as rigs roll off their contracts and were going to see that through yearend blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil okay and then just if i could sneak one more in there for jim you called out the fact that the restructuring – or excuse me just adjusting the cost base and the absorption of labor and overhead especially as we see declines in the fourth quarter are going to be tough to deal with from a margin perspective would you call out certain businesses that we were really hitting that kind of biting cantcutanymore decremental as we saw them in q james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah id say i guess the one that i would call out as not having this impact is valves with the activity levels staying up those margins have been very resilient but probably the most pervasive would be in the drilling and the downhole side as activity levels really are reaching that level where weve taken out a significant amount of the variable cost and in order to achieve greater savings we are going to have to turn more towards these consolidations to take out that base layer of cost prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president and also the pressure of pumping part of the business which has the same dynamics in fact more acute than some of the other product lines will have also the same issues blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil thanks thats very helpful ill turn it back thanks guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer and our point blake is that there are some things we can do on the cost side but we are not going to do things that hurt our capacity capability going forward prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president and on the flip side blake also if we look at the pressure pumping the downhole and the consumable products on the drilling side those product lines will be the first beneficiary when the market stabilizes and we will see the orders in our portfolio c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer right thanks blake allen hutchinson  scotia howard weil great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sean meakim of jpmorgan your line is now open sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hi sean sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc so id like to talk a little bit more about the valves and just really more broadly on the midstream and downstream itd be great to hear a little bit more about how those end markets are holding up for your product lines and it sounds like downstream has been a nice partial offset for upstream and do you think you are seeing it – do you have any better visibility for those end markets obviously relative to whats a pretty foggy upstream outlook prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president the downstream part of the portfolio sean and the markets are pretty stable and we expect that stability on a moveforward basis too the upstream part of the portfolio has seen lot of softness and we expect to see that softness on a moveforward basis too now the refinery part of the market has reached a saturation and at some point they need to upgrade the refineries in canada north america also across the globe we just dont know when that uptick is going to happen but we are seeing some signs very spotty at this point of time sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc yeah c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer were seeing more downstream investment in the middle east and thats evidenced by this one contract we have but there are others there as well as producers in those regions want to be able to sell more products not just crude sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc right yeah it seems like weve been waiting for that downstream pickup forever but hopefully at some point it will come through the other thing i wanted to touch on was sga you mentioned the  million reduction at some point when we do get into a recovery how do we think about growth of sga how much of that would you characterize as structural or efficiency gains as youre improving through the down cycle and how much is cyclical that you think would need to come back to support the business c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah clearly a large part of our sga reductions are cyclical and would come back in a recovery scenario but we will have in a recovery scenario other costs that will generate better savings for instance on the procurement side obviously were not buying so much in goods coming in at this point in the cycle so although were negotiating good percentage savings on our purchasing side the dollar savings arent so much now but they would be greater then so thats why were saying at least  million in cost savings in a strong recovery scenario and then as we add back sga costs as the company grows well be able to offset that cost increase with more savings on the operational side right prady prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president yes of course sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc and then just one last quick one in a similar vein just thinking about working capital how do you think about the drawdown possibilities in the yearend and if we stay at current activity levels what are the additional opportunities through  in terms of what wed expect from a cash basis james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president so two comments first we do have a fair amount of noncash charges in our earnings so even as earnings approach breakeven we have the opportunity to generate good free cash flow even in that scenario without pulling down working capital we feel like our biggest opportunity going into  is in the inventory area our turns have come down from around  times to this last quarter of about  times on the much lower activity we did see in the quarter our first reduction of about  million of inventory which was a good move its hard to get that engine going from growing to shrinking but we have turned that corner and wed expect to see that accelerate into  and its fair to say at these activity levels we believe that over the next – im going to call it twoyear period because it takes a while to move the inventory at slower when activity is slower theres probably  million of opportunity to take inventory or working capital off of our books over the next two years c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer and i would just add sean that weve been averaging so far this year  million per quarter in free cash flow after capital spending and we think that we can maintain that average rate of free cash flow per quarter – clearly through  and through  sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc the free cash flow generation has definitely been impressive yeah thank you for all the detail i appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of george oleary of tph  co your line is now open george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc morning guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer morning george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc just wanted to drill down a little bit into the drilling  subsea segment a little bit further if i could and then i had a pressure pumping question in there so i guess if you compare and contrast the drilling with downhole the two reporting units that were down sequentially which was down more materially on the quarter im not looking for quantitative guidance but just qualitatively which was c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer they were down pretty close and both being tied to drilling and completion activity george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc and was flow equipment essentially in line with those in terms of the magnitude quarteronquarter c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer flow equipment – the pressure pumping obviously whats going on in the pressure pumping market out there for the service companies and as we all know really struggling on the pricing standpoint i think those companies are doing whatever they can not to spend money and particularly on maintenance items that need to be expensed so that business is a struggle for our customers and as a result theyre not wanting to spend any money they dont have to so were seeing demand down there more sharply george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer all right thats shortterm right at some point you need to start maintaining that equipment if its going to continue to work george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thats helpful color and then you guys have done a great job on the free cash flow generation and it looks like theres still a good bit more for you guys to do from an inventory standpoint i guess how much running room do you see is left there to blow down inventories as we move forward c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer a lot james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so we have about  million in inventory and by our best assessments we could bring that down to around  million so its a lot of room george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc and then maybe one more just kind of a qualitative question and there are a lot of customers in some of your end markets that we would consider sort of distressed or at ebitda breakeven levels how are just customer conversations going now versus three months ago and how are customers behaving today c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so as i said that there has been a real paradigm shift in customer attitudes and its across the board and the emphasis is on preserving cash and balance sheets the biggest customers are wanting to protect their dividend and then they want to protect their credit rating or as we move down they want to stay within their debt covenants or they express it in terms of staying within their cash flow or not outspending their resources they all express it depending on their particular position differently but the result is the same a great reluctance to spend money at these oil price levels and so thats accelerating the destocking its deferring maintenance and consumable items deferring whatever one can but that as we say that cant go on for a long and once we get to a sustainable level of activity then the spending would need to increase also to a sustainable level george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thanks for the color guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob mackenzie of iberia capital partners your line is now open rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc thank you i guess jim question is probably for you but anyone else feel free to jump in from a standpoint of ma with you guys kind of hovering at or below breakeven levels of revenue does that change how you think about potentially buying companies in order to consolidate facilities and put more volume through your existing plants c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer acquisitions are a key part of our strategy we have a strong financial position so we continue to view ourselves as acquirers and consolidators and i think we have a stronger financial position than many other companies of our size so we think were entering a phase in the cycle where more opportunities for acquisition are developing but our experience has been that in order to actually reach agreements on valuation and get things done that has more often happened as the recovery begins to kickin and as folks have better visibility on the end of a downturn rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc okay thanks in terms of your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter would we expect to see kind of the distribution of where the fall comes from to be similar to what we saw from q to q c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer i think the important thing about q is a lot of it is driven by this paradigm of not wanting to spend money budgets being exhausted lets wait until next year things slowing down in a way its going to be a twomonth quarter were going to get to mid thanksgiving – midnovember and theres going to be a lot more discussion we think with our customers and their customers about the two hs hunting and holidays and i think that is going to cause and be associated with not much going on from a business standpoint and a lot more discussion of the two hs and low activity as we go into the year and just waiting for next year coupled with not wanting to take delivery of a lot and put it on your balance sheet at yearend and just help your working capital as everybody is trying to show the best cash flow they can right rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc right but i guess so my question is more along the lines of which – are the same product lines we saw weakness in likely to stay being weak and for example would valves remain fairly defensive on a goforward basis prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president we expect the valves business to be still stable in the fourth quarter the product lines which are exposed on the completion side which is the pressure pumping the downhole part of the portfolio will see a decline and also the drilling consumables side the customers are trying to preserve cash i think we expect to see some decline also our backlog is also depleting over the year and we will see some backlog depleting too in the fourth quarter rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc is most of the backlog still in subsea prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president subsea and drilling rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc okay thank you ill turn it back operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of david anderson of barclays your line is now open j david anderson  barclays capital inc hey cris i guess first kind of a little bit biggerpicture question obviously weve been hearing about the thanksgiving slowdown happen from a lot of people here so i dont think thats a huge surprise but in your experience on the other side of this somebody earlier today said they were expecting a huge firstquarter pickup – hearing about socalled budgets being reloaded and people going right back to work others are talking about a delay as budgets kind of do come out people kind of look at balance sheets you kind of hinted about that a little bit a few minutes ago how are you kind of thinking about how  could progress so lets just take oil prices out of this but right now the way budgets kind of get set when do you think people actually do start getting back in activity would that be kind of later first quarter from what you can tell for right now c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah david i think its going to be a slow start to the year i think we end the year with low momentum and that carries over to the first quarter but its going to be low people are going to kind of be waiting to see what happens with oil prices so startout slow and were hopeful that we kind of reach the bottom here things level outs and then gather momentum as the year goes on j david anderson  barclays capital inc and then if we think about your drilling technologies business and sort of the consumables in there obviously were going to have a lot less rigs being active probably structurally going forward how does your business kind of reposition itself going forward i guess i would just assume theres going to be – obviously will be a lot more tier  rigs can you talk about maybe the opportunity in the consumables side on that tier  side i think a lot of people are just kind of wondering how this – with the mix shifting of the rigs in the market how does that kind of impact your business as we think about kind of a recovery here c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer for our products tier  rigs use the same kind of handling tools pump consumables pump packages as other types of rigs maybe higher pressures but the key point is these newer more capable tier  rigs drove faster right so theyre handling more pipe theyre pumping more fluids so its all about how many feet are drilled and as were drilling longer laterals as were doing more pad side drilling unless moving the rigs more uptime on the pumps and more turning to the right so that intensity is probably a good thing for us and it provides some offset to the fact that there would be fewer rigs working but the important thing for us is the trend the rate of change so when the rate of change is rapidly down as it is now there is not a need for consumables because they can be used off rigs that are being stacked but once that flattens out and then particularly when it inflects and begins to go up and you need to resupply a rig thats been stripped thats very good for our business j david anderson  barclays capital inc and i guess one last question on the consumables side maybe this is a little bit more on kind of flow equipment im wondering about weatherford was talking about artificial lift sort of hitting that getting close to that inflection point on customer inventory levels and their own inventory levels this has been a bit of a subject weve talked about over the years with you guys can you help us understand a little bit of kind of – i guess this is more of a flow equipment question where kind of the customer inventory is versus your inventory and the rest of the market and where we are in that cycle c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well i think we as manufacturers we and others probably have plenty of inventory thats not an issue but as weve been saying i think the customers are doing whatever they can to avoid or defer purchasing and so they are definitely working down their inventories j david anderson  barclays capital inc still more okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of martin malloy of johnson rice your line is now open c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hey marty martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc good morning just along the lines of shifting focus to prepare for an upturn can you maybe talk to us about any new products that you are introducing that youd like to highlight that we should pay attention to prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president sure marty i think the products which will see the first benefit of the market stabilization would be in the area of pressure pumping downhole and the drilling consumable products and they also commercialized several new products this year for example in the case of downhole were just launching our thirdbody centralizer and also a shorty frac plug which reduces the operational cost for our customers in the case of pressure pumping our objective is to reduce the maintenance cost of our customers and were going to launch a couple of new products in that space in the next few quarters and as you know during the otc we commercialized our  horsepower pump which were going to take the benefit of that during the upscale also the powerends of jmac – the jmac acquisition which we did early part of the year is gaining momentum on the powerends even during the downturn we have sold several powerends which improves the life of the powerend which is available in the marketplace so our play during the up cycle is not only to take the benefit of the market stabilization but also commercializing these products which improves the efficiency and the operating cost for our customers c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah on the drilling side our complete pump packages now for the replacement fluid and to the liners and our pquip system for making a liner replacement more efficient and selling that as a complete system now i think were doing a better job of supplying packages for our customers and theyre beginning to realize that as well and across each of these businesses there are new products and packages that were introducing and i think that will go over well prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president and just this year alone marty weve commercialized about  new products across all product lines and most of them are focused on improving the operational efficiency and the operating cost for the customers martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc okay and if i could ask a question on the subsea side i think in the past youve said for  that aftermarket or nonnew rov orders or revenues were about  million about  can you talk about maybe how we should think about the trends there in a downturn when you dont have a lot of new rovs being ordered for the aftermarket side c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah we have some but not a lot of new rovs being ordered and so a greater part of our subsea revenue will be more the operating expense spend by our customers whether that is on tooling or positioning equipment or on spares and refurbishment for our rovs martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc relative to  million run rate during  would you expect that to still trend down some or do you potentially c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that will trend down some because utilization of rovs is declining but its not declining as fast as the rov capital side so the rov part of our business is our probably latest cycle of our businesses and tends to follow by a year the downturn in other parts prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president probably the only thing ill add to that marty is as you know our subsea business has the capex and the opex part the opex part of the business seemed to have stabilized over for the last several months but also one of the product lines in subsea which we expect to be stable going into  is the moffat the moffat product line had a record year in  and we expect them to be stable going into  too martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc great thank you c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of james wicklund of credit suisse your line is now open james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning guys c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer hey jim james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker cris you talk about strategy and you made a point of youre shifting your strategy – and you made it sound serious and important and comprehensive and im just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that i know youre going to lean manufacturing and youre consolidating and closing facilities and putting things together and the integration and efficiency but it sounded like more than that and you made a point of it being a change and shift in strategy going forward c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so let me be clear jim that forums strategy is that we are a capitallight high cash flow generating consumableoriented company with strong brands serving the drillingsubsea completions markets the emphasis change in our strategy is a change from managing for the downturn to instead managing for a recovery and i think that how one manages for those two things is a bit different so streamlining our costs but with an emphasis on how were going to get ongoing benefits from those cuts while preserving and hopefully enhancing our capabilities from a technical product development standpoint and ability to respond to our customers shorter cycle process right so thats i think the main point jim is a shift from managing for a downturn to managing and positioning for an upturn james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thank you thats very helpful also if i could you talk about how ma is one of the core competencies of your business and it has been in the past and you also noticed that its awful hard to get deals closed in the current market when do you think ma really will start to occur c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think that the active period for ma will be as recovery – the early stages of a recovery and the reason for that is the seller doesnt feel like they are at the – selling at the bottom as a buyer we have visibility that of how long the downturn is going to last and can bake in some more positive aspects into our valuation and at that point valuations are more likely to come into line and also from the sellers standpoint having made it through death valley there an opportunity to sell without having to go through that again is attractive james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay gentlemen thanks very much appreciate it c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks jim operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of robin shoemaker of keybanc capital markets your line is now open robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc yes thanks so cris going back to your statement about how youve delivered most of your backlog that you had going into the downturn and now youre i guess going forward delivering more recently booked backlog so wanted to ask the question about what youve seen during this downturn in terms of pricing weakness or pricing discounts i think of your products as not having meaningful pricing deterioration in the downturn but i wanted to see if you would comment on it c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah thats right far less than the service companies or certainly nothing like drilling contractors and thats just true of the manufacturing business in general prady you can comment on what were seeing from a pricing standpoint prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president i think if you look across the product lines depending on what the product line is the impact of pricing we are seeing is in singledigits to doubledigits in some product lines if i had to give you the extremes of it i would say valves where we have not seen any impact on pricing or even if we have seen its been a minimal impact on pricing and then on the extreme end probably the pressure pumping and the downhole products again the products where we will see them which are forced are the ones where we are seeing the impact of pricing however weve been able to offset part of the pricing pressure with some of the initiatives we have on the operational front which is the procurement savings and our procurement savings are in high singledigits across the operations and some of the things weve done on the operational side of consolidation of plans and using lean and some of the other initiatives that weve been talking about all thats helping to offset the pricing pressure and thats one of the reasons why weve been able to hold our margins still in doubledigits c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yes right and then just to put a pin in it probably the average price reduction across the company is upper singledigits prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president correct robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc okay okay good so then in terms of this recovery that were kind of preparing for – basically with all that youre doing now if we assume that you went back to something like the  million to  million revenue per quarter run rate where you were in  are you saying that  basis points that youre getting now is that what we would expect in a revenue run rate versus those kind of highteens margins c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer robin that is what were saying that in a recovery scenario where revenue does recover that we feel with this streamline cost structure that were now working towards we will be able to save in that scenario  basis points prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president with no impact of – positive impact of any pricing clawback so as the market turns and when we start pulling back the pricing thats on the top robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc okay all right that answered my question thank you c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thats what were managing for thanks for the question robin robin e shoemaker  keybanc capital markets inc yes yeah thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mike urban of deutsche bank your line is now open michael urban  deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning wanted to come back to your comments around the change in focus and how youre managing the company here going forward so certainly seems like a shift from playing defense a little bit to maybe a more offensive kind of approach youve gone through some of what that entails kind of interested in why and whats the – you know what gives you the confidence that now is the time to do that i would actually tend to agree with you you kind of want to zig when others are zagging but it seems like everyone else is still zagging and playing defense and kind of settling in for a potentially protracted downturn here so again just wondering kind of why youre taking a bit of a different course c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well i think one important point is we have the advantage of a strong balance sheet strong cash flow and dont have to worry about the existential questions right so that gives us the luxury of looking ahead and planning for what we should be doing rather than what we have to be doing thats an important element of it secondly we view ourselves right at the forefront right at the leading edge of our business being tied to whats happening in activity levels or even the trend in activity levels in real time so unlike say some of our big capital equipment brethren who have very long lead times for their equipment and long cycle backlogs we work in a very realtime shorter response on this basis so we will be able to through our products see the benefits much more quickly but we need to position the company to realize those benefits and to have a better cost structure going forward weve given up price through this downturn as an industry as a service and equipment industry unlike any other that i can recall we cant count on getting that back anytime soon so having a better cost structure is an important element for competitiveness forum for better words has the position of as a young company of having many levers that we can pull of the things that prady has been talking about of implementing better procurement lean systems that we really havent had before and have a real impact for us but weve got to get those things in place now if theyre going to give us that leverage as the market turns and we dont know exactly when that is but we do know its getting closer and we expect as we said that the bottom to the inflection point is in  prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president from an operational standpoint if we can have three things accomplished going into the stabilization mode and the uptick is better cost position and all the operational initiatives we have will position us to go have that stronger cost position that what we had in  broader customer portfolio and broader product portfolio michael urban  deutsche bank securities inc and if it is turns out that youre wrong in that view and we are settling in for an extended downturn here perhaps lasting well into if not all of the next year do you have to shift gears again is there an incremental level of retrenchment or do you feel like with what youve already done plus the initiatives you announced today that youve got a sustainable cost structure anyway and youre still okay – again given some of the things you highlighted you have a good balance sheet and you are pretty comfortably free cash flow positive c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer were definitely free cash flow positive and we have a strong balance sheet and i think as we said just getting to a point of stability even if its at a low activity level that would be better than this constant deceleration that weve been in here for a long time so at some point it does need to bottom out and we think that were getting closer to that i would be very surprised if we continue to see the rig count declined the way it is for another year i think it might be at zero by that point michael urban  deutsche bank securities inc thats the good news it can only go to zero thats all for me thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chase mulvehill of suntrust your line is now open b chase mulvehill  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks good morning so lets see just one last question most everything else has been answered and you hit on this on the working capital i think – did i hear the number that your inventories – you thought you could get them down by  million was that right james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president yes chase over a twoyear period with activity as low as it is i dont want to imply that thats easy obviously customers have to demand it but we do believe that we have that much in terms of inventory that we can bring down and at these activity levels where we should be so it is the  million opportunity b chase mulvehill  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and so i guess if we kind of look at that over the next couple of quarters how should we be thinking about inventories and total cash from working capital james w harris  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i think that probably the best way to think in terms of cash flow chase is as cris said earlier that  million run rate on free cash flow after capex there may be some quarters that would be a little better and some a little less but it will average around that  million number b chase mulvehill  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay all right thats all i have thank you c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer thanks chase operator thank you and our last c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer one more question operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of brandon dobell of william blair your line is now open brandon b dobell  william blair  co llc hey good morning guys thanks just two quick ones did you guys think about the performance in north america versus international markets how do you expect that to look as you work through qq and is there a concern that theres going to be a longer duration on how long it takes the international market to find a bottom or some stability c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think were closer on the north america market particularly us market here and i think that will reach bottom first international there are a lot more forces in play including national oil companies that have bigger countrywide issues to deal with particularly in areas outside the middle east big economic issues that could impact their spending plans for longer so yeah i think there is that difference prady iyyanki  chief operating officer  executive vice president in the costs of international theyre still stable and the middle east is still pretty stable west africa and north africa are still seem to be stable the deal we have – the egypt deal which we received in the third quarter is another good sign so theyre spotty markets in international which are still pretty stable operator thank you im showing no further questions at this time ill turn the call back over to cris gaut for any closing remarks c christopher gaut  chairman  chief executive officer well we
