misunderstood businessjun  about pangaea logistics panl reid hudson value special situationssummarypanl is a unique business that hasnt really been affected by the downturn in the shipping industryi believe a mischaracterization of the company is responsible for its mispricingpangaea has an effective management team with aligned incentivesoccasionally you can find a company that may be incorrectly labeled or viewed as being part of an industry that doesnt truly reflect the value of its operations on even rarer occasions you can find that this company is included in a distressed industry that would cause it to be further mispriced i believe pangaea logistics solutions ltd panl may be an example of this kind of company pangaea logistics is a global shipping and logistics company that employs a unique business model which focuses on customer relationships instead of vessel ownership and shipping rates pangaea which describes itself as a provider of seaborne drybulk transportation services contracts with industrial customers for the transportation of materials such as iron ore coal pig iron grains bauxite hot briquetted iron alumina cement clinker limestone and dolomite the company derives most of its revenue through contracts of affreightment coas which are usually long term contracts to transport a specified amount of materials from one port to the other pangaea extends its efficiency by focusing on backhaul routes in which it carries cargo that will bring in cash while it is returning to a primary port that it is usually contracted to load and move goods from pangaea lets its fronthaul routes take care of themselves because they are confident those can be acquired more easily in a march  interview edward coll pangaeas ceo said they will even turn down contracts if they dont present good backhaul opportunities edward coll contrasted their coacentric business model with that of the rest of the industry by way of real estate examples he stated that most shipping companies are floating apartment buildings that will charge their customers the going rate to live in their rooms whatever the market determines it to be they buy ships and let other people manage and run them while they collect the checks pangaea on the other hand contracts for the sure payments ahead of time and then uses a variety of methodschartered in owned vessels etcto earn the money they provide a service instead of just tonnage being one of the only dry bulk companies i could find that actually made money throughout  and  pangaeas approach looked very interesting while most shipping companies are tying up their capital in the ownership of ships to capitalize on the operating leverage that accrues when rates increase substantially pangaea prefers to invest in its business and is content with hitting triples instead of home runs as long as that means growing the business organically and generating consistent cash flows most of the ships it utilizes are chartered in on a short term basis usually less than  months to service its contracts in pangaeas  st quarter q it states that it owns and partially owns  dry bulk carriers on a given day in  pangaea is usually operating around  carriers so as you can see the majority of its fleet is chartered in pangaea bought its first dry bulk carrier in  to generate a higher number of coas since then pangaea has opportunistically acquired ships only when necessary and only when it had a coa ready to be utilized pangaea began building and buying ice class carriers because it saw a niche opportunity where it could compete in a market with very few competitors in  nordic bulk carriers a pangaea subsidiary was the first company to traverse the northwest passage nwp and was the first nonrussian company to transit the northern sea route nsr in  both of which shorten shipping days substantially provide tremendous cost savings for clients and are expected to be utilized more as the industry matures while staying true to its effective strategy pangaea has quickly become a major player in the niche panamax ice class subsector pangaea came public through a reverse merger in  that was written about extensively on seeking alpha mainly because of the involvement of joel greenblatt quartet merger corp a special acquisition company spac set up by successful value and activist investor eric rosenfeld not the one involved in long term capital management acquired pangaea which was then a private company shortly thereafter dry bulk rates tanked and the market cap of the company tanked as well while i do not know when rates will increase i believe that they eventually will i dont expect anything close to the earlytomid s rate environment but with pangaeas stable cash flows now seems like a good time to be a buyer it is obviously not a peak i do not pretend to possess any knowledge related to macro trends but the last few years have been a perfect storm of oversupply and decreasing demand the number of dry bulk carriers increased dramatically to take advantage of the high rates a few years ago while global trade and dry bulk volume has been growing steadily it suddenly stalled in  chart from openseapro during what is widely considered to be the most distressed shipping market in history pangaea generated about a  and  fcf roic in  and  respectively because the new coas it enters into are based upon the prevailing dry bulk rates panls revenue has decreased since  it has had to take a few asset impairments but since it is mostly an operator instead of an owner these have not been substantial another interesting fact about pangaea logistics is that they do not pay any income taxes they are incorporated in bermuda and utilize section  of the internal revenue code which states that the revenue of certain corporations that are incorporated in certain foreign countries is exempt from taxation relating to shipping operations pangaeas st quarter  results dont appear as impressive as they actually were net income of  million was roughly in line with the first quarter of  but was actually depressed by a  million charge for a saleleaseback expense that normally does not occur with that added back and income attributable to noncontrolling interest taken into account net income for the quarter should be about  million valuation i believe pangaeas balance sheet does not accurately reflect the value of the assets it owns sure the ships it owns are included but what are the real assets attributable to pangaea the coas are pangaeas true assets it just utilizes the ships it owns and charters in to monetize these assets this then begs the question of what the value of these coas actually are sadly we are not provided details about most of pangaeas contracts in its filings or press releases to try to gain somewhat of a perspective i look to pangaeas free cash flow to get this number i use operating cash flow minus stock compensation expense because i consider this to be a true expense income attributable to noncontrolling interest and capital expenditures most years panl does not list any capital expenditures besides the small amounts required for the upkeep of its offices and owned real estate property looking back through pangaeas financial statements which unfortunately only go back a few years because of its fairly recent public listing i was able to find an investing expense on the cash flow statements listed as drydocking costs pangaea describes these costs as expenses for upgrades and improvements to owned operating vessels that is the only expense listed on the cash flow statements that i could find that appears to represent what would normally be called maintenance capital expenditures the largest expense listed was  million in  since this is the highest expense listed and since there is not a drydocking cost recorded most years i have chosen to use  million for the capex number this puts fcf at about  million and  million for the full years of  and  respectively with pangaeas market cap around  million it appears to trade only at around x its current depressed fcf and x its  fcf pangaea is priced slightly below its current net asset value but as i said earlier it is most likely priced substantially below its true nav in their  s filing quartet provides details about what they think the intrinsic value of pangaea really is in this analysis they primarily value pangaea on a relative value basis comparing it to what they consider to be its most comparable competitors through this process quartet comes to the conclusion that panls equity value is somewhere between  million and  million before they took any cash from the transaction into consideration obviously this is substantially above what pangaea is currently selling for but the discount is understandable given panls current cash flow profile despite pangaeas resistance to the inherent cyclicality of its business it is still somewhat susceptible to rate swings even if the effects are minimal furthermore pangaea is valued upon this basis and is discounted because of the fact even though its operations tell a different story i believe it would be wise to try to replicate this valuation method even if it was used almost  years ago quartet believed that there were no companies in the us that exactly resembled panls unique business model that being said it did lay what it believed to be the most comparable companies it could find i think using this list of mostly logistics companies will be beneficial in deciding on an intrinsic value for pangaea a few notes on the following chart all numbers are from the full year  financial statements except for debt and shares outstanding i have made an adjustment to echo global logistics fcf number for  because it possessed what i considered to be an extraordinary capex number recorded for  also for navios maritime holdings i could not find an indepth presentation of its fcf so i decided to exclude those blocks from the chart in the graphic above it is obvious that pangaea is valued lower than all of the logistics companies that are displayed that is expected considering it is not a full fledged logistics company and still is somewhat more assetintensive than these companies one thing that is apparent however is that it is not in the same class as most shipping companies the  results above do not necessarily tell the whole story for pangaea while most of the logistics companies listed have been growing and some are even at peak earnings pangaeas results were from what is considered one of the worst years in its history panls  fcf roe is respectable but its  fcf roe puts it well in line with the logistics companies it is being compared to with a fcf roe of  in  pangaea demonstrates that it can generate results similar to assetlight logistics companies that are known for their high returns on equity looking into the past and future it is also apparent that since this is a trough free cash flow year for pangaea its normalized fcf would be substantially higher than what it is now free cash flow of around  million is an entirely reasonable expectation considering panl has achieved  million multiple times in the past this would put the current share price at about x that cash flow number looking at the comparable companies i think it is entirely reasonable to apply a x to x multiple to pangaeas free cash flows but until the market realizes what kind of company it is this might not happen what is also apparent is that pangaea has substantially more debt than most logistics companies this was expected and was even talked about in the  s a time during which pangaea had very little debt pangaea had been planning to take on debt and access capital markets to increase its ownership of vessels what is encouraging is that although pangaea has a substantial amount of debt it is not very large when compared to the rest of the shipping industry pangaeas interest coverage is at about x for  even with a relatively depressed ebitda normalized ebitda would also cause the evebitda multiple to be substantially lower than the other companies on the list s evebitda was actually around x another thing to keep in mind is that growth is not taken into account in this valuation pangaea has been generating substantial fcf that it can plow back into its business to generate growth in the future growth of around  was actually expected when quartet made the acquisition what wasnt expected was that the dry bulk shipping environment would descend into what could be the worst few years in its history i really do think pangaea has handled the last few years better than any dry bulk shipping company i have ever seen and i am confident in its management to reinstate its growth in the upcoming years risks major risks for pangaea logistics include rapid increases in dry bulk carrier charter rates although it does hedge its exposure with forward freight agreements ffa its debt extreme fluctuations in dry bulk shipping rates extreme fluctuations in bunker fuel costs antitrade measures geopolitical issues and the obsolescence of its trade routes or the way it does business pangaeas debt appears to be manageable and it seems to have sufficient access to lenders and capital markets their interest coverage ratio is in check and if dry bulk shipping rates rise high enough maybe newly completed coas will allow pangaea to pay down substantial parts of its debt about  of its debt is floating rate but it has been entered into interest rate swaps until this year i know nothing about united states or international tax law but the reinstatement of income taxes on pangaea is cited as a risk in its k although its lawyers conclude that pangaea meets all the necessary requirements the implementation of taxes would cause a substantial drop in pangaeas net income and free cash flow the question of a sustainable moat has come to mind multiple times and like most companies operating in a commodity sector it is a hard one to answer through its ice class carriers pangaea is operating in an area of the dry bulk market where it has and probably will see the least amount of competition this isnt to say that competition cant increase as the arctic routes become more wellknown and used i assume more companies will build and operate ice class carriers this could be years away which will help pangaea tremendously in the meantime as for the rest of its business pangaea seems to operate very differently than almost every other shipping company out there edward coll appears to value relationships and curiosity tremendously its hard to quantify but a culture can increase a companys value exponentially furthermore pangaea has adopted a customer and service centric business persona and has branched out into logistics operations this helps to keep customers renewing contracts and will undoubtedly increase the amount of customers that want to do business with pangaea pangaea has assisted customers in cargo loading and discharge vessel chartering technical vessel management and voyage planning although these operations are not a substantial portion of pangaeas revenue one can see how they can help to draw in repeat business this sounds like things that traditional logistics companies do to help their customers achieve their desired shipping experience pangaea has gone as far as to assist in the construction of a new port recently matching the two parties and transporting about  million tons of construction material to the port since entering the contract the thing that has bothered me the most about pangaea has been their recent equity private placement at a share price below the share price at the time and well below what i consider to be panls intrinsic value through this offering pangaea raised  million for the acquisition of new vessels but added about  million new shares as every good value investor knows dilution below intrinsic value is an inherently value destructive action the majority of the time this action seems to lump panl in with the rest of the distressed and overleveraged shipping companies that have had to issue equity at the bottom of the market although this is troubling at first glance i would suggest a deeper look into pangaeas goals and how this offering might allow them to be accomplished why would pangaea issue equity at the price that it did which was  a share from what management has said it was to buy a ship perhaps pangaea views this current environment as the most opportune time to be a buyer of ships with dry bulk rates still extremely low the value of ships for sale has dropped dramatically no longer are the thousands of other companies scrambling to add to their fleet by the day and take advantage of elevated rates no longer is there a massive order of ships being built for future use as the rates decrease so do the prices maybe pangaea views this as a valueadded acquisition because of the price of the ship compared to the revenue it may generate in the future i agree with panl that debt doesnt need to increase very much but issuing equity below intrinsic value for whatever reason has come to be seen as the one sin no management can overcome i would suggest that the reason and context of the situation matter very much issuing equity during a rising interest rate environment to buy a ship at a depressed price that can help to add accretive free cash flows in the future may not be such a bad thing im not saying this should be overlooked but i guess what i am saying is that it comes down to how well you trust the management conclusion the last sentence leads me directly into a discussion of pangaeas management pangaeas management is experienced and has interests that are very much aligned with shareholders considering all directors and executive officers as a group own about  of the company this is very encouraging to me the current management has been running and growing pangaea for a long time and considering they have a large amount of their net worth tied up in it will continue to run and grow it as efficiently as they can they were not looking for a cash out when they took the company public they were looking for a partner to help them access the capital markets management compensation is very reasonable and having people like eric rosenfeld on the board is very encouraging eric invested a large amount in the company through his spac and has built a reputation of fighting for shareholders rights and values also jacob maweaver of cable car capital a fund that has achieved spectacular returns owns panl and has written about it extensively i would encourage all readers to go read his investor letters and see what he has to say about pangaea like i have said in the past having people smarter than you on your side is always helpful and encouraging pangaea logistics is a very interesting and unique company that appears to be overlooked and mispriced because of its perceived position in a distressed industry while the risks are very real i believe pangaea offers the opportunity for a double whammy type of return brought on by fcf growth and a revaluation as always feedback is welcome disclosure i amwe are long panl i wrote this
