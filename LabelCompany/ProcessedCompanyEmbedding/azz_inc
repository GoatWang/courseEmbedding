nyse   hot dip galvanizingproven performance and significant cost savingshot dip galvanizing has been utilized for over  years to protect steel and iron from the destruction of corrosion  the process which has evolved over the years entails dipping fabricated steel into a kettle of molten zinc  the iron in the steel reacts with the zinc to form a tightly bonded alloy coating which protects the steel from corrosion galvanized steel has a significantly lower life cycle cost than other materials such as painted steel or epoxy coated surfaces and requires no coating maintenance over its service

missed guidance the galvanizing and electrical products company failed to meet its own expectations and lowered guidance lee samaha tmfsaintgermain apr   at am its never a good thing when a company misses its current fullyear guidance and then promptly reduces its guidance for the coming fiscal year but thats the reality of azz incs nyseazz fourthquarter earnings report a combination of weak ongoing endmarket conditions and the bankruptcy of westinghouse hit azz hard in short it was another difficult quarter for the company lets take a closer look at what went wrong azz inc fourthquarter earnings the raw numbers starting with the headline numbers for the full year fullyear fiscal  revenue of  million compared to previous guidance for revenue slightly below a guidance range of  million to  million fullyear eps of  compared to previous guidance for slightly below a guidance range of  to   that previous guidance was last given on the secondquarter earnings release in october fastforward to the disappointing set of thirdquarter earnings released in january and ceo tom ferguson said we are working toward issuing guidance for fiscal year  within a few weeks we will update our fiscal year  fullyear outlook at that time management promptly gave its fullyear fiscal  guidance in february but made no mention of  guidance on the release azz galvanizing operation image source azz inc guidance for  reduced  in addition to missing  guidance management reduced the  guidance it gave just a couple of months ago here is the updated guidance compared to what was given in february fiscal  revenue of  million to  million compared to  million to  million fiscal  diluted eps of  to  compared to  to  clearly somethings going wrong but what what happened in azz incs fourth quarter heres a breakout of segment sales income and margin in the quarter segmentsalesyearoveryear changeoperating incomeyearoveryear changemarginyearoveryear change energy  million   million    bp galvanizing  million   million    bp total  million   million    bp data source azz inc presentations bp  basis points  on the earnings call ferguson referred to generally weak endmarket conditions for both segments thanks to continued contraction in our markets due to the economic fallout of the low oil patch activity lower solar opportunities and a continued low level of major refinery turnarounds but the pain doesnt stop there there were significant declines in energy revenue income and margin a major cause of this was the bankruptcy of westinghouse  a company ferguson described as being a fairsized customer of the energy segment turning to the galvanizing segment endmarket demand was weak but there were also cost pressures from the rising price of zinc essentially azz tried to pass the cost increase on but as senior vp tim pendley put it on the earnings call competition has been reluctant to move in that direction which has challenged some of our volume the end result was a significant loss of revenue and operating income in the galvanizing segment though operating margin was held to a small decline looking ahead on a more positive note pendley said of galvanizing we finally feel like we have hit the bottom there and then are bouncing back up moreover managements overall guidance still implies revenue growth of  to  there is not a lot azzs management can do about lost revenue in the energy segment due to the westinghouse bankruptcy or ongoing weakness in oil and gas so most hopes will likely rest on an improvement in galvanizing in the back half of the year
