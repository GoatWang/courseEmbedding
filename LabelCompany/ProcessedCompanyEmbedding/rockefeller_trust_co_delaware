time in france is visiting provence in the springtime lisi and her family moved back to new york city after her freshman year of high school on her time in africa after taking the bar exam lisi decided to take a little time off her idea of “time off” however was a tad more adventurous than others as she embarked on a journey to africa for a month lisi was hosted by a family in arusha tanzania and spent time visiting various communities on attending law school at vanderbilt university lisi loved everything about going to law school in nashville tennessee one of her favorite places to spend time was the blue bird café which is an iconic spot that features performances by country music singers and songwriters perhaps this is why lisi can always be found listening to country music
