of america msn in psychiatric mental health nursing from the catholic university of america bsn from villa maria college first job waitress at richard’s a local diner what i’m reading “memory man” by david baldacci words i live by treat others as you would like to be treated   the most important quality a woman leader should have is… …selfconfidence and a high degree of pride in herself and in what she’s doing this is especially critical when building relationships providing mentorship for others and making decisions it becomes evident if a woman leader does not believe in herself the career advice i’d give my former self be open to an unscripted journey you cannot plan every aspect of your career or you may miss important opportunities also make decisions and comments based on logical reasoning and support as opposed to emotion the one thing i’d do differently in my career knowing what i know now is… …to find a way to finance my initial nursing credentials at the creditbased baccalaureate level as opposed to a hospitalbased training program it wasn’t an option for me at the time so now i work on building nursing curriculum so adult learners who are in my shoes have the opportunity  when i really need to focus on a project i… …work backward i start at the end product and mentally organize the pieces then process what is needed i let it sit for a while then return and further develop it over the course of a few hours overnight or a couple of days or weeks depending on the project my biggest career leap and what i learned from it was… …choosing an academic position over becoming a director of nursing practice a hospital ceo told me i couldn’t be in both worlds this formed my continuing stance to bridge the gap between them advocating for strong partnerships as a dean and pastpresident of the american association of colleges of nursing being a woman in my profession has been… …selfactualizing—a process of choices as a nurse i provide care health promotion and education as a leader i advocate for and mentor future nurses faculty and deans as an academic i educate students and work with faculty to impact healthcare including the development of nursing programs at walden university i’ve learned that failure is… …an opportunity to learn i haven’t had many failures in my life or career because i work hard not to make mistakes but i try to look at the positive and learn admit the failure and you will respect yourself more and earn respect from others i maintain a healthy personal life by… …separating work from family life whenever possible i am a voracious reader of nonindustry books and remain very active outside of the house whether it’s through daily walks weekly dancing lessons with my husband tennis water skiing camping or fishing my grandchildren and their many activities also keep me active i knew my present career was what i wanted to do when… …after an impulse decision to become a nurse a yearold with a lacerated liver was placed in my student care i saw and cared for her through my pediatric surgical and criticalcare rotations i felt like i died when she died but that’s when i knew nursing was for me   comments rosemary tilley april    author thank you for your coments in this article i have been a nurse for  years and over this time i have never wanted to do anythink else years ago i was assaulted at work i injured my right hand  i can not go back to clinicle practise i am now  years old i have just started study again i am doing a dipolma in community services at management level and psychology after this i will complete my bachelor studies in frensic psychology i here what you have said that sometimes we miss oportunities i know that it took me along time to believe that i could be a exellent nurse it was back in  i took up a position as a connecting care nurse at blacktown hospital it was a fairly new concept looking after copd  heart dibeties ht renial mental health and aboriginal care in the community after being discharged from hospital  we did all our assemments and follow ups by phoneit was quite a jump from working in the clinical setting in the wards there was computer programes to learn wealth of information to take in about all the services in the community how different referrals were done all documentation had to be done on chime which was a completely new computer system which had to be learnt off course there was training given but it was not easy system to learn during this whole process i was stretched to the max the cases i had always seemed so complex to sort out the first months i was always asking and checking everything i did then i had to come to a place where i began to trust my own experiences that i had learned over many years this position that i was thrown in made me realised that i could be truly effective in helping these clients and fostering diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace at management level after doing this for  months i became quite sick and was unable to remain in this sector of work due to the severity of my illness at the time again i felt something was robed from me that day after i recovered i still had work cover issues to deal with i then decided to complete my bachalor of nursing which was only months to do my work at connecting care was considered all the clinical placements that i had to do these were all marked off with all of my other nursing experience so by me sharing all of this i believed that i was ready to take that next step to be a role model and to be able to encourage and build good solid relationships at work and in the community sector it has been a challenge at times because in my early days of nursing it was hospital based but the nursing i had in the country was stricted  you knew where you stood the sequence of command from matron to sister to nurse was always profreshional and therefore you knew what was expected of you there was respect for rank and i do believe this has gone out to some degree today and needs to be fostered once again however i do not like the way some nures use power in the wrong way in there postion of influence thankyou again for sharing your experiences in nursing you have achieved so much in your life and you should be very proud of your achievments you have inspired me to do all i can and do it well kind regards
