theoretically unlimited risk of loss  the smaller capitalization companies the fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies therefore small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies the fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments  foreign investments may be riskier than us investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions changes in currency exchange rates incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities and political or economic instability  foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than us stocks the risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment the fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options including  the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates  there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of

companies › turner  newall turner  newall company history turner  newall an asbestos product manufacturer and mine operator was founded in rochdale england in  by brothers john robert and samuel turner originally known as turner brothers the company started off manufacturing cotton clothbased packaging and as one of its claims to fame was the first company in the united kingdom to weave asbestos fibers into cloth after that  innovation turner brothers changed its name to turner brothers asbestos company a  merger with washington chemical company newalls insulation company and jw roberts led the company to change its name to turner  newall the company grew rapidly throughout the s and s by acquiring bell’s united asbestos companies and several other asbestos insulation companies throughout the uk starting in  turner  newall operated an asbestos mine in the country of swaziland in southern africa the company continued operating the mine until  after world war ii turner  newall became involved in other areas of asbestos product manufacturing the company acquired the zimbabwebased porters cement industries in  and renamed it turnall fibre cement ltd – “turnall” being a combination of the two names “turner” and “newall” in  the michiganbased automotive supplier federalmogul corporation acquired turner  newall but federalmogul was overwhelmed by asbestosrelated lawsuits against its new subsidiary and put turner  newall into chapter  bankruptcy protection in  products manufactured by turner  newall that contained asbestos when turner  newall got its start in the asbestos business the health risks associated with the mineral were relatively unknown while there had been an inkling that asbestos could be harmful as early as the st century ad – when greeks and romans noticed that slaved forced to weave asbestos cloth frequently came down with lung afflictions – it would be nearly two millennia before anything was done about it however there is evidence that leaders at turner  newall were aware of the health risks for decades and allowed their workers to get sick anyway in  the company’s director reportedly wrote “all asbestos fibre dust is a danger to the lungs if we can provide evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims we may be able to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk” asbestos – a naturally occurring mineral mined from deposits like the one operated by turner  newall in africa – was used in a wide range of products starting in the late s its strength resistance to heat and fire and its low price tag made it a popular choice for manufacturers but we now know that asbestos is comprised of long crystalline fibers that when inhaled can cause debilitating lung diseases like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis one of the products made by turner  newall that contained asbestos was limpet spray a spray used for structural fireproofing acoustical ceiling treatments and for insulating turbines and other heatgenerating equipment the company also manufactured tafford tile asbestos cement sheets a product used in the walls and roofing of industrial and agricultural buildings the following is a list of turner  newall products believed to have contained asbestos along with the years they were manufactured if

three particles per cubic centimeter workers recalled regularly sweeping asbestos dust off the floor and even spitting the substance out of their mouths in this type of environment all workers were at risk individuals who worked on sites where turner  newall products were used were also at high risk of exposure turner  newall limpet spray was used “all over the world for acoustical treatment in public buildings industrial plant railway rolling stock road vehicles ships etc” according to a  product catalogue airports underground tunnels and even the rotating restaurant at the top of the space needle in seattle washington were sprayed with the substance turner  newall newsletters said in the early s workers who applied this spray worked on demolition at these sites or who simply worked in the vicinity of the product could have been exposed and of course anyone who labored in one of turner  newall’s asbestos mines in africa was put at an extremely high risk of being diagnosed with an asbestosrelated disease recent news facing an overwhelming number of asbestosrelated lawsuits turner  newall filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection in  the company emerged from bankruptcy protection

contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos what is asbestos long considered a miracle material asbestos boasts excellent fire and heat resistant properties this naturallyoccurring mineral now known to be a human carcinogen cancercausing agent has a history that dates back to ancient greece asbestos was used as a building material even as far back as during the roman empire asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles during the industrial revolution asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the united states asbestos was used not only in factories but also in oil refineries chemical plants on railroad cars and in shipyards asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives to line tanks and ovens in refineries and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships from engine rooms to galleys as the twentieth century progressed more uses for asbestos were found it was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles insulated america’s new skyscrapers and was used extensively in the construction industry where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds cements roofing shingles ceiling and floor tiles siding stucco plaster and much more those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestosheavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products by the middle of the twentieth century it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma this asbestosrelated cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium this thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface this scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous yet continued to allow its use over time as stories of sick employees became commonplace the american government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos asbestos exposure in the united states exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites in shipyards aboard navy vessels and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings people working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk in addition teachers students and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products such as ceiling or floor tiles equally at risk are families of these workers as asbestos often was carried home on clothing asbestos exposure across the united states

branches of the military for many years navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving on ships aircraft carriers destroyers submarines battleships warships etc in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country army veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and while working on military vehicles air force veterans were exposed while working with military aircraft marine corps veterans that spent time at sea aboard navy ships were exposed to asbestos all veterans exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma commercial and industrial exposure many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer the types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries power plants steel mills and chemical plants to name a few they all have “high heat” environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas ie fireproof gloves and aprons today even though the use of asbestos has been banned in the united states many existing industrial and commercial structures may still contain a certain level of asbestos it is important that appropriate safety precautions be taken where necessary to prevent harmful exposure and to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma commercial product exposure doityourself home renovation enthusiasts as well as those who worked in the construction trade may have been exposed to asbestos while working with popular building and construction products many of these products were made with asbestos through the late ’s as the projects they were to be used in required that they be heat and fire resistant they included insulation roofing material siding joint compound ceiling tiles flooring and more unfortunately when any of these products were cut sawed filed or sanded asbestos fibers were released into the air in the majority of cases those working with the products did not use appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information about the health hazards of asbestos for many years today as a result construction workers and doityourselfers are at risk for developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases second hand exposure direct onthejob asbestos exposure did not affect american workers alone their family members were also at risk of developing an asbestosrelated disease as a result of second hand asbestos exposure this type of exposure occurred when workers brought asbestos fibers home on their hair clothing or shoes at the end of the work day those responsible for laundering their work clothes day in and day out were most commonly affected but even small children who spent time with their parent before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at risk of developing an asbestosrelated illness talc exposure talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits due to this some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos while talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure some consumer products namely baby powder and more recently children’s art supplies have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users mostly women to be exposed to asbestos today products using talc are tested for asbestos but that was not always the case because mesothelioma has a long latency period miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestoscontaining talc products unions protect workers from asbestos exposure throughout the united states and across the world hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries from steel workers to plumbers to electricians unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job unions have organized witnesses for court cases have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by megacompanies to compensate asbestos victims compensation for workers exposed to asbestos if you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure you may be

october  share this pagefacebooktwitterlinkedin click to view pdf version since fall  colleges churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry inspired by these actions individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal oil and gas companies green century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy this moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change while saving for their future here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies  get your investments in line with your values climate change is a serious threat to our society and burning

fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations through lobbying in state capitols and congress for years this power has helped thwart progress on the policy solutions to climate change the fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful south african divestment campaign and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change  strengthen the climate movement climate change is so profound and the solutions so wideranging that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference the divestment strategy is successfully engaging the public a coordinated and organized climate change network – that includes mayors church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies  may reduce exposure to stranded carbon assets the fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal oil and gas that – if extracted and burned – will release five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe if governments restrict carbon emissions companies owning those fossil fuel reserves may not be able to extract and sell them the reserves may become stranded assets and investors may then be left with devalued assets divesting now could allow investors to reduce their exposure to a possible collapse of the socalled “carbon bubble”  reinvest

a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can    investing in sustainable companies  leading shareholder advocacy program  supporting environmental and public health nonprofits  sustainable investment strategy for  years green century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values green century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental social and governance esg performance may offer financial advantages for example we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment communities in which they operate and public health they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation green century offers three mutual funds the green century msci international index fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental social and governance performance the green century equity fund invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longestrunning socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index the green century balanced fund invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide sri and valuesbased exclusions fossil fuel companies – coal oil and gas nuclear power companies military weapons and civilian firearm companies producers of genetically modified organisms gmos tobacco companies examples of sustainable companies with outstanding esg ratings energy efficiency renewables water treatment  conservation air pollution control sustainable infrastructure and transportation companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts sustainable agriculture companies including organic and natural food suppliers companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain green century uses valuesbased or socially responsible and impact sri investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries this aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal oil and gas companies green century also employs environmental social and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector while some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies green century uses both to deliver high impact investments fossil fuel free investing green century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the us our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest  fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves green century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical andor financial reasons they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for extract process and refine and transmit coal oil and gas as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves as more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind “low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free it might be but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment  since there is no standardized characterization of the term you should review the prospectus see below for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption review the prospectus marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion such as avoiding fossil fuel companies and should be spelled out in the prospectus the prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives investment strategies risks as well as other details without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in green century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus you can review the prospectus of the green century funds by clicking here our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets httpgreencenturystagingwpenginecomwpcontentuploadspdfvideomp     what about performance there are growing concerns about investing in coal oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices capital expenditures on highcost projects such as offshore and arctic drilling and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets fossil fuel
