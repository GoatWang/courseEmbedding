wilmington delaware  gary c crossen esquire and rebecca l tepper esquire rubin and rudman llp boston massachusetts attorneys for pdc milford power llc opinionthe plaintiffs in this case milford power company llc and the owner of a  interest in milford power milford holdings llc bring this case seeking a declaration that defendant pdc milford power llc “pdc” has lost all membership interest in milford power as a result of its filing of a petition for bankruptcy on february     although pdcs bankruptcy petition was dismissed the plaintiffs nonetheless allege that the plain terms of the milford power llc agreement automatically divested pdc of its membership interest in milford power upon pdcs filing of its bankruptcy petition and assigned its membership interest and all attendant rights to milford holdings as the sole remaining member of milford power   furthermore the plaintiffs allege that the plain terms of the llc agreement dictate that this assignment occurred without any obligation on the part of milford power as assignee to pay pdc any compensation for its prior interestfor its part pdc contends that the doctrine of unclean hands prevents the plaintiffs from relying on the ipso facto clause in the llc agreement because pdc sought refuge in bankruptcy when plaintiffs affiliates improperly sought to foreclose on pdcs membership interest   in addition pdc argues that the ipso facto clause in the llc agreement is preempted by certain provisions of the federal bankruptcy codein this opinion i conclude that pdcs unclean hands defense does not bar the plaintiffs from relying upon the ipso facto clause in the llc agreement   but i also conclude that the ipso facto clause is preempted to the extent that it would deprive pdc of the economic rights available to an assignee of an llc membership interest under § b of the delaware llc act by contrast the ipso facto clause is enforceable insofar as it divests pdc of its right to participate as a member in the governance of milford power   this conclusion rests largely on my adoption of the reasoning of the united states district court for the district of delaware in in re it group inc i factual backgroundmilford power is an llc that was established to own and operate a natural gasfired electric generation facility with  megawatt capacity aka a “power plant” in milford connecticut   when created milford powers ownership was split up between what can be regarded as two different parties in interest   through two separate affiliates a large public company el paso corporation held  of milford powers membership interests and was the party that put up substantial cash to help fund the construction of the power plant   for the sake of simplicity i herein refer to these affiliates solely as el pasothe other member of milford power was pdc pdc is a singlepurpose entity that was formed by a texasbased development firm power development company llc pdc alleges that it played an important role in developing the idea of building the power plant in milford connecticut and helping milford power obtain the necessary approvals   in connection with this role pdc received a  membership interest in milford powerthe llc agreement vests the power to manage milford power in the members   the agreement creates several committees to manage the firm and each member including pdc is given the right to appoint representatives unanimous consent of the members is required in order for milford power to engage in certain activities including mergers repurchases of member units or bankruptcy filings  as to certain other important decisions a supermajority vote of the members of relevant committees is required  it is unclear from the text of the llc agreement whether el paso had sufficient voting power on any committee to meet this threshold without support from the pdc member   for still other decisions a mere majority vote of the members is required  on a daytoday basis the llc agreement contemplates the appointment of officers to conduct the companys operations and by its own terms created a position of general managerfrom the getgo milford power was substantially leveraged   although el paso contributed over  million to fund a bridge loan milford power obtained an additional loan which eventually became nonrecourse for over  million from a syndicate of lenders the “lenders”   although this debt was not an obligation of pdc itself pdcs membership interest in milford power was pledged as collateral to secure the loan as were the member interests controlled by el pasoas far as can be ascertained from the record this debt matured and was due and owing as of october     but milford power defaultedthe lenders agreed to a forbearance to give milford power more time   when that time ran out milford power remained in defaultwhat happened precisely at this stage is unable to be determined on this record with accuracy   the parties have burdened me only with excerpts from pleadings filed in an action in a new york court that is related to this case   i have therefore attempted to distill from these documents the essence of what occurred and of what is indisputableaccording to pdc the lenders made certain promises during  to work with milford power to restructure the defaulted debt   but then says pdc the lenders changed direction and permitted el paso to exit the milford power scene in exchange for el pasos member interests in milford power and certain additional unspecified consideration   el paso transferred its member interests to a new entity ultimately controlled by the lenders   the lenders sought approval from the federal energy regulatory commission for the transfer of el pasos interest in milford power to their new vehicle milford holdings   pdc did not object to that requestin their application the lenders indicated that their intention was not to become longterm operators of the power plant but instead to find a thirdparty buyer   according to pdc the lenders led it to assume that pdc would be able to retain its membership interest in milford power and receive a  share of any later sale of the entitybut instead of doing so the lendersor so pdc contendstook an entirely different tack   initially milford holdings purported to bind milford power to a management contract under which the firms operations would be managed by an entity named cpv milford llc which is the managing member of milford holdings   allegedly this decision was made without any input from pdc as have other allegedly important business decisions   but the ferc application to which pdc supposedly consented describes at length the substantial authority that would be vested in cpv milford a description that was designed to persuade the ferc that milford holdings and its investors the lenders to milford power would not be deemed a public utility in part because cpv milford would have “complete discretionary managerial authority over the project company and be responsible for the management of all activities of the plant”  then the lenders began to take steps to foreclose on pdcs membership interest by scheduling a foreclosure sale   as of that time period milford power owed the lenders in the vicinity of  millionwhat pdc did in response to the foreclosure is what gives rise to this case   rather than sue the lenders in an appropriate state court to enjoin the foreclosure sale pdc filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of massachusetts on february     in its filing pdc indicated its intention to file an adversary proceeding against the lenders alleging among other things that they were improperly acting to deprive pdc of its membership interest in milford powerthe lenders moved to dismiss pdcs filing on grounds that cannot be discerned from the record before me   on april   the bankruptcy court granted the motion to dismiss in a handwritten order that is devoid of explication   on june   the bankruptcy case was officially closeda few weeks later two lawsuits were filed   in the supreme court of the state of new york the lenders filed an action seeking to foreclose on pdcs interest in milford power   the lenders alleged that milford power owed over  million to them as of june  and that the money the lenders would raise in a sale of pdcs interest should be used to reduce that amount   el paso was also named as a party because it allegedly held a subordinate security interest in pdcs  interest that same day milford power brought this action for declaratory judgment   in this action later joined by milford holdings as an intervening plaintiff milford power sought a declaration that pdc had automatically assigned its membership interest in milford power to milford holdings when it filed for bankruptcy   in the complaint the plaintiffs relied on article  of the llc agreementthe “ipso facto clause”which reads in pertinent part as followsautomatic withdrawal of membera member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the company and shall be treated as a withdrawn member under this agreement automatically upon the occurrence of any of the following eventsa immediately if any member shall i voluntarily file with a bankruptcy court a petition seeking an order for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws ii seek consent to or fail to contest the appointment of a receiver custodian or trustee for itself or for all or any significant part of its property iii file a petition seeking relief under the bankruptcy arrangement reorganization or other debtor relief laws of the united states or any state or other competent jurisdiction iv make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or v admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature the llc agreement defines the term “withdrawn member” in article  which reads as followsa right to withdrawsubject to the provisions of article xi a member in this agreement called a “withdrawing member” shall have the right to withdraw from the company at any time after the commencement of commercial operations of the plant by ten days written notice to the other members in this agreement called a “withdrawal notice”   the withdrawing member shall assign all its rights and interests in the company to the remaining members or their designees and the withdrawing member waives any and all rights that it might otherwise have had pursuant to the act arising from its withdrawal from the company   the withdrawing member hereby irrevocably appoints the company its attorneyinfact with full authority in its place and stead and its name or otherwise to take any action and to execute any instrument which the company may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish such assignment of the withdrawing members rights and interests in the company to the remaining members or their designees   upon thirty days prior written notice the company may terminate any contracts or agreements with the withdrawing member or any of its affiliates pursuant to which the withdrawing member or its affiliates provide materials or services to the company and the company shall have no further liability to the withdrawing member or its affiliates under such contracts or agreements other than the payment of any obligations incurred prior to the date of such terminationb reimbursement rightsin the event of such withdrawal the company shall retain all contributions theretofore made by the withdrawing member and such withdrawing member shall pay its share of such further obligations and commitments that are due and payable at the time of the giving of the withdrawal notice including any obligations attributable to the work performed or actions taken by the members or any committee of the company prior to the date of withdrawal including termination costsc indemnification of withdrawing memberthe remaining members shall indemnify and hold harmless the withdrawing memberi for all amounts due and payable in connection with the company and its business after the date of withdrawal that were not incurred prior to the date of withdrawal  andii for all amounts or damages arising out of activities of the nonwithdrawing members or the company undertaken after the date of withdrawal through this action the plaintiffs seek a declaration that pdc is a “withdrawn member” and that milford power is its attorneyinfact for the purpose of transferring pdcs interest to milford holdings   during the course of the case it has become clear that the plaintiffs do not believe that any consideration is owed to pdc for this transferpdc reacted to the new york and delaware suits in a related manner   in the new york action pdc alleged that the lenders in concert with milford holdings had breached certain duties they allegedly owed to pdc and therefore that the lenders should be precluded from foreclosing on pdcs member interest in milford power and were liable to pdc for damagesmeanwhile in this action pdc takes the position that its bankruptcy filing was caused by improper conduct by the lenders a nonparty to this action and by milford holdings an entity affiliated with the lenders that is a party to this action   candidly it is difficult to discern exactly what misconduct the lenders or milford holdings engaged in that could in the end be found to constitute a cognizable breach of legal or equitable duties owed to pdcas pled and as recounted in an affidavit filed by pdcs manager in this court pdc contends that the lenders and milford holdings have engaged in “a pattern of conduct demonstrating a concerted and improper predatory plan to divest and take pdcs  interest prior to any sale of milford power in order to reap  of the proceeds from” the sale of the power plant for themselves  the theory of their approach seems to be that the lenders think that  the power plant is worth substantially more than the over  million owed by milford power  that el pasos relinquishment of its equity and pdc suspects payment of some additional cash fully satisfied the debt owed by milford power and  that the lenders are trying to steal pdcs rightful  of the upside from a sale of the power plantto a judge who handles a lot of business cases the picture that is painted seems intuitively implausible   it presupposes that el paso which had put up substantial cash equity and which owned a  interest in milford power made a completely irrational decision to not only give up its interest but to pay additional cash to do so even though the power plant had a sale value that would easily pay off the debt  and produce a huge upside   in fact in its papers pdc argues that its  interest was worth  million   when i asked for clarification i was told that this was the value assuming a full pay off of the over  million owed to the lenders if that is true pdc is alleging that milford power has an enterprise value of  million and therefore that el paso had in fact fallen off the proverbial turnip truck before it decided to exit its investment in milford powerin a confusing postargument submission pdc attempts to prove that the power plant will generate over  million in guaranteed payments a year from a cost of service agreement between the power plant project and iso new england inc for the duration of the plants service life   it is not at all clear what this means  in particular whether this sum was a total or the amount that would be received by milford power in excess of the costs of operating the plant   in any event pdc does not dispute that the lenders are currently due over  millionii the plaintiffs motion for summary judgmentthe plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is presented in a straightforward manner   they argue that the plain language of the milford power llc agreement operated to automatically turn pdc into a “withdrawn member”  and to transfer its member interest to milford holdings as of the time pdc filed for bankruptcy   the provision of the llc agreement that so provides is they argue fully consistent with delaware law because an express provision of the delaware limited liability company act providesa person ceases to be a member of a limited liability company upon the happening of any of the following events unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement or with the written consent of all members a member  b files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy furthermore the plaintiffs argue that the terms of the llc agreement make it clear that as a “withdrawn member” pdc had no further claim on milford power and that its membership interest was assigned free of charge to milford holdings   as the llc agreement makes clear the term “withdrawn member” is defined identically to the term “withdrawing member” in article   that section provides that a withdrawing member “shall assign all of its rights and interests in the company to the remaining members or their designees and the withdrawing member waives any and all rights it might have otherwise have had pursuant to the act arising from its withdrawal from the company”   notably within thirty days of the withdrawal milford power may terminate any contracts for the provision of goods and services between itself and the withdrawn member and shall have no further liability under those contracts “other than the payment of any obligations incurred prior to the date of such termination”   although the withdrawn member is entitled to indemnification from milford power as to any acts of the llc or its members after the withdrawal that is the only apparent duty owed to the withdrawn member   the withdrawn member retains however the obligation to pay all capital contributions or other debts owed to milford power as of the date of the withdrawal and milford power is entitled to “retain all contributions theretofore made by the withdrawing member․”  for all these reasons the plaintiffs say that it is indisputably clear that as of the date pdc filed for bankruptcy it automatically became a withdrawn member and its membership interest was to be assigned to milford holdings free of chargeiii pdcs arguments against summary judgmentunsurprisingly pdc does not believe that matters are quite so clearcut   it contends that summary judgment should be denied to the plaintiffs for three primary reasonsfirst pdc argues that the equitable doctrine of unclean hands precludes the plaintiffs from obtaining the relief they seek  that is pdc seeks to advance an affirmative defense as a barrier to summary judgment   for the reasons previously noted pdc argues that milford holdings and the lenders have engaged in a course of inequitable conduct designed to deprive pdc of its  stake in milford power   because of their oppressive conduct pdc contends that it had little or no option but to seek protection from the bankruptcy court   thus because pdcs filing was allegedly caused by the improper conduct of milford holdings or at least by its controlling affiliates the lenders pdc argues that milford holdings cannot exploit the bankruptcy filing and use that as a basis to divest pdc of its membership interestsecond pdc contends that the ipso facto clause of the llc agreement that purports to have made pdc a withdrawn member when it filed for bankruptcy is preempted by federal law   to wit pdc says that the llc agreement is an executory contract and that certain provisions of the bankruptcy code preclude the effectiveness of a contract provision divesting a debtor of a property interest in an executory contract simply because the debtor filed for bankruptcyfinally pdc argues that even if the ipso facto clause of the llc agreement purporting to make it a withdrawn member is not preempted that provision does not unambiguously provide for a transfer of pdcs member interest free of charge to milford holdings   according to pdc such an interpretation of the llc agreement would render the bankruptcy provision a penalty provision which is at best disfavored by our lawi address the first of these two arguments in turn   as will be seen my resolution of the second issue renders it unnecessary for me to address pdcs third argumentiv pdcs unclean hands argument lacks meritpdcs initial argument is that it was somehow forced into a bankruptcy filing by the lenders and milford holdings and that the affirmative defense of unclean hands bars the plaintiffs request for summary judgment   because its decision to enter bankruptcy was caused by allegedly improper acts of these parties pdc contends that milford holdings cannot rely upon the ipso facto clausethe problem with pdcs argument is that it is unsupported by any factual contention that makes sense   contrary to the plaintiffs i believe it possible to conceive of circumstances in which the improper conduct of a party to an llc agreement towards a fellow member could in fact render that member insolvent and cause a valid bankruptcy filing   in that circumstance the party that acted improperly could be deemed to have forced the bankruptcy filing and therefore be estopped from relying upon that event as a basis to deprive the innocent member of its ownership interest in the llc whether considered unclean hands as pdc would have it or as a contractual defense precluding milford holdings from relying upon the occurrence of a condition its own behavior brought about in the correct circumstances pdcs argument might be indulged this is not an intellectual exercise however   pdc bears the burden of producing evidence that rationally creates a triable issue of fact regarding the sustainability of its affirmative defense  but it has failed to do so advancing no facts that plausibly support a finding of unclean hands on the part of the plaintiffs   despite its protestations to the contrary pdc is wellpositioned and dutybound to support its argument by a noncursory affidavit   pdc presumably knows exactly what has been done to itin none of its submissions has pdc presented any basis to infer that the lenders did not have every right in law and in equity to collect the massive debt owed to them by milford power   collecting on a lawful debt that is in default is not unfairly predatory  it is a necessary and typical course of action for a lender whose borrower has failed to pay a debt that is duein this respect it is important to note that none of the supposed misconduct to which pdc points is causally related to its bankruptcy filing  for example pdc argues that it was somehow led to believe that the lenders and milford holdings would allow it to continue to hold its  interest in milford power after el pasos interest was transferred to milford holdings and would receive  of the proceeds from any sale of the power plant   that argument is unsupported by any nonconclusory affidavit describing exactly when and how the lenders and milford holdings communicated that supposed agreement to pdc despite the fact that pdc is obviously wellpositioned to make such a description   nor does the record contain the manifestation one would expect of a representation of that magnitude namely a writing of some kind indicating that the lenders or milford holdings was waiving any of their rights under the llc agreement or the lending agreements   but even more importantly whether a representation of that kind was made or not simply could not have caused pdc to file for bankruptcy   the representation if any did not make pdc insolvent or even operate to divest pdc of its membership interestlikewise the mere fact that the lenders had taken steps to foreclose on pdcs membership interest does not on this record create a triable issue of fact precluding summary judgment for the plaintiffs   the lenders had lent milford power over  million milford power was in default as to approximately that same amount and pdcs membership interest was pledged as security for that loan   given these facts and given the lack of any sensible articulation of a different economic reality by pdc it is impossible to rationally infer from this record that the lenders decision to foreclose could constitute unclean handsmost crucially the lenders decision to foreclose did not cause pdc to make a bankruptcy filing   pdc had the option which it has now taken to seek to enjoin the foreclosure by filing a lawsuit in state court   instead it made the tactical decision to file a bankruptcy petition that the bankruptcy court found to be improvident   that pdc no doubt did so precisely to forestall the foreclosure sale does not however mean that the lenders actions rendered pdc insolvent and therefore caused the bankruptcy filing   the decision to file for bankruptcy was pdcs own tactical choice and there is no evidence that creditors other than the lenders were beating on its doorlikewise pdcs assertion that milford holdings has been making decisions for milford power without including pdc in the process does not preclude summary judgment   regardless of whether or not that has occurred and whether or not that was improper if it did occur milford holdings actions did not cause pdc to file for bankruptcy   if pdc believed that its rights as a member of milford power were being violated it could and later did file a lawsuit   but there is no evidence that those violations rendered pdc insolvent or caused it to file for bankruptcyin sum there is no evidence in this record that would justify a rational inference that the lenders did not have a good faith basis to attempt to foreclose on pdcs interest in milford power   the cursory and confusing contentions made by pdc regarding the supposedly improper conduct towards it do not cohere into any rationally explicable economic scenario involving inequitable or illegal conduct by the lenders and milford holdings   at best one infers that pdc believed that it possessed some ability to extract consideration from the lenders as a price for supporting the transfer from el paso to milford holdings and thought that it had done just that by receiving unspecified representations from someone unspecified on some unspecified date that pdc would continue to own  of milford power regardless of whether the lenders had been repaid in full   an unusual belief of this kind would seem to be precisely the kind that would normally be embodied in a writing and none is in the record   nonetheless what remains most critical is that none of the supposed misbehavior by the lenders or milford holdings caused pdc to make a bankruptcy filing in so concluding i do not hesitate to surface some normative assumptions that support the result i reach   for starters the unclean hands doctrine should always be applied with prudence and not as a wideranging license for judges to constrain parties that are alleged to have engaged in conduct that might be perceived as harsh or unfair but that is nonetheless not a breach of any precise legal or equitable duty  many sophisticated parties like pdc sign contracts that have terms that might be considered onerous  our law does not relieve them of the burden of those decisions simply because of their afterthefact regrets   to do so would greatly undermine the utility of contracts to the detriment of wealth creation to adopt pdcs argument would invite debtors to resort inappropriately to the bankruptcy courts in situations when there are other legal processes open to them to protect their rights   rather than pursue the appropriate course of action and attempt to enjoin the procession of a foreclosure sale in the expected mannerthrough an action in a state court with jurisdictiondebtors will simply make bankruptcy court filings   even if as here that bankruptcy court filing is later dismissed as unwarranted the debtor has bought time because of the automatic stay provision thus forestalling the foreclosure sale through the simple expedient of making an unjustified filing   even better from the debtors perspective is that the improvident filing comes almost costfree because the debtor would have license to argue that the doctrine of unclean hands precludes the enforcement of contractual rights belonging to the lender or its affiliates that are triggered by a bankruptcy filing unless and until it is definitively determined that the lender and its affiliates did not violate any legal or equitable rights of the debtor regardless of whether the debtor was actually rendered insolvent by the lender and its affiliates before the bankruptcy filingthere is no justification for creating a perverse incentive scheme of this kind in the name of equity   if a debtor believes that a lender is improperly foreclosing on its interests it is of course free to seek to enjoin the foreclosure or to file for other relief   but if instead it chooses to file a bankruptcy application the debtor is in no position to demand that a court of equity to relieve it of the consequences of that tactic when the tactic fails because the bankruptcy court concludes that the filing was unsustainable   that is especially so when the debtor cannot articulate any rational basis for the court to make a rational inference that the lenders were not acting in the good faith belief that they had a right to foreclosefor all these reasons i conclude that the doctrine of unclean hands does not prevent the entry of summary judgment for the plaintiffs   if pdcs claims of improper conduct by the lenders are later upheld by a new york court pdc can be made whole by an award of monetary damages  in the meanwhile there is no rational justification in equity or law for preventing milford holdings from exercising its clear contractual rightsv is the ipso facto provision in the llc agreement preempted by federal law pdcs next argument requires a consideration of provisions of the bankruptcy code that have generated conflicting and confusing decisions from federal courts   thousands of pages of judicial lawyerly and academic writings on the subject have tried to instill some predictability and coherence into the aspects of bankruptcy law relevant to this decision but no consensus has resulted leaving conflicting precedentthe courts of this state have no power to clear these murky waters and i will not burden the reader with a recitation of the full debate relevant to the decision i must make   instead i will endeavor to describe the parties contending positions and to render a sensible if by no means inarguable decisioni begin by describing pdcs argument   pdc contends that its membership interest in the llc agreement became part of the bankruptcy estate when it filed for bankruptcy on february   irrespective of the ipso facto clause   in support of that argument pdc points initially to § c of the bankruptcy code which states in pertinent part that․ an interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate ․ notwithstanding any provision in an agreement transfer instrument or applicable nonbankruptcy law  b that is conditioned ․ on the commencement of a case under this title ․  by virtue of § c pdc says that its membership interest vested in the estate when its bankruptcy case was commenced   moreover because of the nature of pdcs membership interest pdc argues that another section of the bankruptcy code is implicated   to wit pdc contends that the llc agreement is an executory contract within the meaning and reach of § e of the bankruptcy code which states in pertinent part thate notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease or in applicable law an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor may not be terminated or modified and any right or obligation under such contract or lease may not be terminated or modified at any time after the commencement of the case solely because of a provision in such contract or lease that is conditioned ona the insolvency or financial condition of the debtor at any time before the closing of the caseb the commencement of a case under this title in contending that the llc agreement is an executory contract pdc is able to draw on the substantial weight of federal authority which treats agreements for the operation of entities like limited partnerships and llcs as executory contracts when those agreements contemplate an important ongoing role for the debtor in management for purposes of their motion for summary judgment the plaintiffs have elected to assume that the llc agreement is an executory contract and i therefore consider that concession to settle the question according to pdc § e embodies congresss intent that ipso facto clauses like the one in the llc agreement be preempted   that is especially so says pdc because §  of the bankruptcy code statesb unless the court for cause orders otherwise a dismissal of a case other than under section  of this title   revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case under this title pdc argues that when taken together §§ e and  establish that its bankruptcy filing must be deemed a nonevent and that pdcs membership interest in milford power must be the same as it had been before the bankruptcy filing   that is pdc contends that §§ e and  represent a clear statement by congress that contractual provisions like the ipso facto clause and statutory provisions such as § b of the delaware llc act are preempted   the public policy that supports this preemption pdc contends is the desire to ensure that valuable assets of a bankrupt are preserved and can be deployed by the bankrupt estate to meet the claims of creditors   thus pdc submits that because the bankruptcy court took no action to deprive pdc of its membership interest during the pendency of pdcs bankruptcy case that membership interest remained undisturbed and revests in pdc free and clear from any effect of its bankruptcy filingpdcs argument is a colorable one   there is federal precedent that holds that an interest in an alternative entityeven a managing interest in a limited partnershipfalls within the protective scope of § e and that an ipso facto clause may not operate to divest a bankruptcy trustee from assuming that contract  there is also precedent from other states that indicates that § e and §  preclude the enforcement of an ipso facto clause by a creditor even when the debtors bankruptcy case has been dismissed and no express order of the bankruptcy court precludes enforcement of the clause  that is this precedent holds that the bankruptcy code does not just forestall the enforcement of an ipso facto clause while the debtor is in bankruptcy or when there is a bankruptcy court order to that effect but instead operates as an absolute bar to the enforcement of a contract or statutory provision that divests a debtor of an interest in an executory contract simply because the debtor filed for bankruptcyas straightforward as pdcs argument might appear at first blush there is other legal authority that cuts against pdcs argument for preemption   for example § e does not apply in certain circumstances to executory contracts to wit paragraph  of this subsection does not apply to an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties ifai applicable law excuses a party other than the debtor to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to the trustee or to an assignee of such contract or lease whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties  andii such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment ․ another subsection of §  also touches on this issue and states in key part thatc the trustee may not assume or assign any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties ifa applicable law excuses a party other than the debtor to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or the debtor in possession whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties  andb such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment these sections taken together bear on this case because they express a federal policy limitation on the bankruptcy codes invalidation of ipso facto clauses   in essence § e and § c taken together the “assumability exceptions” are an expression of congresss recognition that certain types of executory contracts to which debtors are parties eg personal services contracts should not be assumable by a bankruptcy trustee in circumstances when state law would not require the nondebtor parties to accept substitute performance   in the case of an lp or llc agreement that makes the debtorpartner or member a key part of the entitys management on a goingforward basis there is as we shall see a strong argument that these sections preclude a bankruptcy trustee from assuming at least those aspects of the contract granting the debtor managerial rights even if the trustee is the debtor in possessionie when the debtor itself is in charge of the bankrupt estatethe plaintiffs have chosen not to dilate on the ramifications of the assumability exceptions to the bankruptcy codes antiipso facto clause provisions preferring to rely upon a strand of state law authority   this authority comes from state courts that have addressed the question of what effect §§   and  of the bankruptcy code have on the enforceability of contractual ipso facto clauses against a debtor whose bankruptcy filing is dismissed without any order of the bankruptcy court addressing whether the clause can be enforced after the dismissalin miller v parlor furniture of hickory inc a lease contained an ipso facto clause triggered by the filing of a bankruptcy petition   the debtors bankruptcy case was dismissed and the lessor sought to terminate the lease in reliance upon the ipso facto clause   the north carolina court of appeals held that the lessor could terminate statingin rendering “ipso facto” or bankruptcy termination clauses unenforceable pursuant to  usc § e “congress meant to foster the process by which a trustee or a chapter  debtor in possession could assume a lease so that it could ‘be utilized to assist in the debtors rehabilitation or liquidation’ ” citation omitted  in re national shoes inc  br   bankrctdec crr   br west  bankrsdny   this purpose is apparent from other provisions of the statute giving the trustee of the debtor the right upon court approval to assume or reject unexpired leases  usc § a  and to assign such a lease notwithstanding a provision therein restricting assignments  usc § f  however where the bankruptcy case is dismissed for failure of the debtor to comply with orders of the bankruptcy court there no longer exists any reason to benefit the debtor or preserve the assets of the bankrupt estate by prohibiting enforcement of an otherwise valid bankruptcy termination clause   such clauses “are not invalidated in toto but are merely made inapplicable during the case for the purposes of dealing with the ․ unexpired lease”plaintiffs allege and the record indicates that defendants chapter  proceeding was dismissed by the bankruptcy court   the effect of a dismissal is to “undo the title  case in so far as is practicable and to restore all property rights to the position they occupied at the beginning of the case”    collier on bankruptcy ¶  at  th ed citing hrrep no  th cong st sess    srep no  th cong d sess   uscode cong  admin   news  p    thus the dismissal of defendants bankruptcy proceeding without any adjudication returned the parties to the same status which they had before the commencement of the case and the protection from the bankruptcy termination clause afforded defendant under  usc § e was lost   accordingly we hold that the provisions of  usc § e do not prevent plaintiffs from maintaining the present actionmiller is important here say the plaintiffs because its reasoning was relied upon by our superior court in chrysler financial corp v fruit of the loom inc in that case the court decided that a lessee that had consented to an involuntary bankruptcy filing had defaulted on a lease governed by texas law because that filing triggered the leases ipso facto clause   because the lessees bankruptcy case was dismissed and the lessee was no longer under the protection of the bankruptcy court judge bifferato justified his conclusion thuslythus it is apparent from the bankruptcy code the legislative history and the case law that although ipso facto clauses are unenforceable in bankruptcy they are enforceable outside of bankruptcy   the goal of the bankruptcy code is to allow debtors a chance to have a fresh start   allowing lessors to terminate the bankrupt lessees lease immediately upon filing for bankruptcy protection would defeat this purpose   the same goal however is not achieved when the ipso facto clause is sought to be enforced against a nonbankrupt lessee which is not entitled to the same protection under the bankruptcy code a nonbankrupt lessee would have to seek protection under state contract law  no such texas authority has been presented   the leases provide that bankruptcy of one of the lessees is an event of default   the language is not ambiguous and it is clear that this was the intent of the parties   when the tenant entered bankruptcy plaintiffs were properly able to allege default under the leases and seek a remedy earlier in his opinion judge bifferato cited to legislative history regarding §  which he read as supporting the result he reached   that history indicates that § e “does not limit the application of an ipso facto or bankruptcy clause if a new insolvency or receivership occurs after the bankruptcy is closed   that is the clause is not invalidated in toto but merely made inapplicable during the case for the purposes of disposition of the ․ unexpired lease”  the plaintiffs argue that i can simply follow the teaching of chrysler financial and ignore the bankruptcy code altogether as being completely irrelevant to this case   as i am not convinced that this is so i will outline the alternative rationale that in my view better justifies the entry of an albeit more limited summary judgment order for the plaintiffs   that rationale is grounded in the assumability exceptionsarguably the delaware llc act excuses milford holdings from accepting performance from a trustee or assignee   for one thing §  represents a default rule of delaware public policy that expresses the view that absent a contractual provision to the contrary members of a delaware llc need not fear that they will have as fellow members bankruptcy trustees or assigns of bankruptcy trustees   that is §  expressly recognizes the unique relationships that exist among members of llcs and protects solvent members from being forced into relationships they did not choose that result from the bankruptcy of one of their chosen coinvestors   likewise other provisions of the llc act that provide that assignees of membership interests be denied any right to participate as a member in the governance of the entity absent a provision in an llc agreement to the contrary  also constitute applicable law that excuses a solvent member from accepting substitute performance as a member from a bankruptcy trustee or an assignee of a bankruptcy trusteethere are of course sound economic reasons why delaware law like that of many other states embraces a default rule that terminates an llc members interest upon a bankruptcy filing   typically llcs are closely held and the members often have important managerial duties and powerful voting rights   the milford power llc agreement is no exception  pdcs  interest gave it a seat on every important management committee and voting rights that enabled it to veto a range of significant business transactions   in a lucid article professor ribstein has persuasively explained the rational reasons why investors in alternative entities would agree in advance to forsake their ownership interest upon filing bankruptcy because by doing so they insulate themselves from the economic harm that might result to them if one of their coventurers files for bankruptcy  the harms than can result include having a coventurer with important power over the entity whose economic incentives are distorted by its insolvency push to liquidate the venture or to take other shortterm measures that are beneficial to it as a debtor but detrimental to the venture as a whole and its other investors  notably professor ribstein also points out that investors are free to structure llc agreements that do not divest members of their interests upon bankruptcy and that creditors are wellpositioned to protect themselves in their dealing with investors in llcs through contract  for these and other reasons professor ribstein contends that the confusing and ambiguous language in § e should not be construed as preempting ipso facto clauses in limited partnership agreements and it is fair to say that his arguments as to limited partnerships apply with full force to llcsat the same time thoughtful commentators hold views in stark contrast to professor ribsteins   for example the national bankruptcy reform commission which was established by congress recommended that “ipso facto provisions relating to partnerships llcs and the rights or interests of partners or llc members should not be enforceable under the bankruptcy code”  the commissions recommendations to clarify this aspect of federal law were not adopted   its recommendations however are echoed in the holdings of several federal court decisions   at a bare minimum the commissions view rests on the notinsensible notion that a debtor ought not be deprived of a valuable interest simply because it has made a bankruptcy filing especially if that interest is a purely economic interest in the relevant alternative entityas i have noted the federal case law interpreting §  of the bankruptcy code is confusing and in conflict leaving the questions of whether and to what extent ipso facto clauses in alternative entity agreements are preempted less than clearly answered   some federal courts such as the united states court of appeals for the first circuit have read § es invalidation of ipso facto clauses broadly and the assumability exceptions narrowly even in the context of addressing the assumability of a managing interest in an alternative entity  on the other hand several federal courts have issued decisions that interpret the bankruptcy code in a manner more sympathetic to professor ribsteins position and more in keeping with delaware public policy   these decisions have read the assumability exceptions in a literal manner construing them as plainly stating that “a debtor in possession may not assume an executory contract over the nondebtors objection if applicable law would bar assignment to a hypothetical third party even where the debtor in possession has no intention of assigning the contract in question to any such third party”   these holdings have read the plain words of the assumability exceptions as representing a congressional intent to respect the contract rights of parties when applicable law provides that the parties do not have to accept substitute performance from a thirdparty without their consent   notably the united states court of appeals for the third circuit and the federal bankruptcy court in delaware adhere to this literal approach a law professor could fruitfully spend the next year or so examining the implications that the bankruptcy code has on ipso facto clauses in alternative entity agreements   as a state trial judge with many cases to decide i do not have all year to peer through the muck in search of what will at most be a debatable answer   rather i must decide promptly whether the clear law of my state is preempted by federal law although state trial judges are dutybound to respect the supremacy of federal law within its expansive sphere and to respect congressional decisions to preempt our law we are not dutybound to go out of our way to look for reasons to preempt our own states law nonetheless the question of whether the bankruptcy code preempts the application of the ipso facto clause in the llc agreement requires this court to apply with fidelity the preemption principles articulated by the federal courts   fortunately the federal courts have been restrained about finding that the bankruptcy codes terms preempt state law provisions generally governing the property rights of bankrupt debtors   although congress clearly has the power to establish uniform bankruptcy laws throughout the united states “congress has also generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupts estate to state law”   therefore in examining whether the bankruptcy code preempts state law the united states court of appeals for the third circuit has held that the “usual rule is that congressional intent to preempt will not be inferred lightly   preemption must be either explicit or compelled due to an unavoidable conflict between the state law and the federal law”  in keeping with that teaching i apply a restrained preemption analysis in this case and do not reach out to imagine or exaggerate conflicts between delaware law and the bankruptcy code on the other hand i am also dutybound not to ignore an “explicit” congressional preemption of state law or an “unavoidable conflict” between the bankruptcy code and delaware law cutting to the chase i do perceive §  of the delaware llc act and therefore the ipso facto clause in the milford power llc agreement to be preempted to some limited extent   in so ruling i acknowledge that under the reasoning of chrysler financial corporation the superior court found that §§  and  of the bankruptcy code only operate to defang ipso facto clauses while the debtor is actually in bankruptcy court and that the federal government has no interest in protecting debtors whose bankruptcy filings are dismissed without a bankruptcy court order protecting their interest in executory contracts containing ipso facto clausesthe problem with that argument from my perspective is that it slights the obvious purpose of the bankruptcy code in precluding ipso facto clauses from working forfeitures of important economic assets of debtors  section  of the bankruptcy code has been construed as extending that protection to a debtor whose case is dismissed   in first sec bank v creech the utah supreme court held that irrespective of a default under an ipso facto clause debtors whose bankruptcy filing had been dismissed had their interests in the relevant contract restored under §  as if the bankruptcy filing had never occurred  in keeping with creech professor erlich has expressed the view thatif the case is dismissed the debtors interest in any property that had passed to the estate prior to the commencement of the case revests in the debtor the instant before commencement of the case   thus the default under the ipso facto clause entailed by the filing of the bankruptcy petition is by force of law neutralized the plaintiffs argue that §  simply means that the debtor gets back the property interest it possessed immediately before the bankruptcy filing but does not mean that the effect of the bankruptcy filing under state law is preempted   although congress gave debtors in the bankruptcy courts protection against ipso facto clauses they noted that §  does not explicitly indicate that the antiipso facto clause provisions of the bankruptcy code continue to preclude enforcement of an ipso facto clause after a dismissal and that there is legislative history that suggests that those provisions only stay enforcement of the ipso facto clause until the bankruptcy case concludes or unless the bankruptcy court expressly overrides the ipso facto clause and vests the property in the estate or a transferee of the estate free and clear of the clauses operation the problem i have with the plaintiffs argument is that it suggests that congresss antipathy towards ipso facto clauses was capriciously implemented   so long as a debtor remains in bankruptcy the bankruptcy code neutralizes the effect of an ipso facto clause thereby enabling the debtors estate to use the asset subject to forfeiture to satisfy creditor claims   but if a debtors bankruptcy case is dismissed the debtor may be stripped of an important economic asset by virtue of the mere fact of filing for bankruptcy without restriction by the combined operation of §§   and a stripping that might in turn lead to the actual insolvency of the debtor   although the plaintiffs contend that congress was implicitly exacting a toll on improvident bankruptcy filings by permitting ipso facto clauses to be enforced after a dismissal they cite no legislative history suggesting such an intent and there are other aspects of bankruptcy law that serve that purpose expressly  in view of the evident hostility towards ipso facto clauses in §§  and  and the language of §  i conclude that congress intended that a debtor whose bankruptcy filing was dismissed should not when its property interests revest under §  be subject to any greater consequences from the operation of an ipso facto clause than it would have been had the relevant contract at issue been addressed within the context of a plan approved by the bankruptcy court itselfas a consequence i reach a result in this case that is different from either that advocated by pdc or by the plaintiffs   for pdcs part it wishes me to conclude that the bankruptcy code entirely preempts the application of the ipso facto clause and §  of the delaware llc act for the plaintiffs part they wish me to conclude that the bankruptcy code has no preemptive effect at all on the ipso facto clause or § i reach the more nuanced conclusion that an ipso facto clause in an llc contract retains the same potency after a §  dismissal that it would have during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding   in so holding i reject in an important measure the argument made by pdc under pdcs view a debtor receiving a §  dismissal would be in a better position to avoid the effects of an ipso facto clause than a debtor whose bankruptcy filing was not dismissed   to understand what i mean it is critical to consider the effect of the assumability exceptions   read literally the assumability exceptions expressly state that a bankruptcy estate may not assume an executory contract over the nondebtors objection if state law would bar assignment of that contract to a hypothetical third party   being under no duty to search for reasons to conclude that congress has preempted delaware law i approach the relevance of the assumability exceptions by accepting the literal interpretation of that section adopted by the united states court of appeals for the third circuit and several other federal courts of appeal  under that interpretation the assumability exceptions preclude even a debtor in possession in bankruptcy from accepting an executory contract if state law would preclude assignment of that contract to a hypothetical third partyapplying this literal approach the question then becomes whether the delaware llc act excuses the members of milford power from accepting performance from an assignee of pdcs membership interest   put more broadly does the delaware llc act excuse members of a limited liability company from accepting performance of an llc agreement from an assignee of another member   although one would not know it from reading the parties briefs this precise question was recently addressed by judge farnan of the united states district court for the district of delaware in the case of in re  it group inc in that case two debtormembers of a delaware llc attempted to assign their membership interests to a third party   another member of the llc northrop objected to the attempted assignment   it argued that the delaware llc act did not require northrop to accept performance from the debtormembers assignee and that the ipso facto clause in the relevant llc agreement was enforceable   in the alternative northrop argued that the delaware llc act precluded the debtormembers from assigning anything other than the rights specified in § b of the delaware llc act which accords an assignee the right to participate in profits and losses of a limited liability company   moreover northrop contended that a provision of the llc agreement giving members a right of first refusal as to the transfer of any other members interest was enforceableon appeal from the bankruptcy court judge farnan held that the bankruptcy court was correct in rejecting northrops primary argument and embracing its alternative argumentthe bankruptcy court held that the debtormembers were barred from transferring their full membership interests because delaware law excused northrop from accepting substitute performance   in other words the assumability exceptions operated to exempt the ipso facto clauses force from § e and to permit the ipso facto clause to deprive the debtormembers of their noneconomic rights as members   by contrast however the bankruptcy court held that the debtormembers could assign their economic interests in the profits and losses of the limited liability company because delaware law did not excuse northrop from accepting assignment of these “bare economic rights”   to that extent the ipso facto clause was invalidated by § e and the debtormembers retained their ongoing right to profits and losses and could transfer that interest   in so holding the bankruptcy court rejected northrops argument that the debtors were “either in default ․ or were not” under the ipso facto clause and that there was no reason to treat the economic rights of the debtor differently from the rights of the debtor to participate as a full member on appeal judge farnan affirmed statingunder  del c § b the members of an llc are permitted to assign their bare economic interests to another entity   in pertinent part section § b provides that an assignee is “entitled to share in such profits and losses to receive such distribution or distributions and to receive such allocation of income gain loss deduction or credit or similar item to which the debtor was entitled”   because the applicable law does not excuse the members from rendering economic performance to an assignee the court concludes that section ea does not apply and the default provision is unenforceable as an ipso facto provisionjudge farnan also upheld the bankruptcy courts determination that the debtormembers right to transfer their bare economic rights was subject to northrops right of first refusal   because the right of refusal existed as to any transfer whether the transferor was in bankruptcy or not that property right was to be respected within the bankruptcy process and would not he reasoned injure the debtormembers ability to recoup the full value of their bare economic rights applying the reasoning of judge farnan here leads to the conclusion that the ipso facto clause in the milford power llc agreement is effective to the extent that it deprived pdc of its ability to participate as a member in the governance of milford power   under the delaware llc act other members of milford power areas a matter of default lawexcused from accepting substitute performance of governance rights and duties and therefore the participatory rights of pdc fall outside the reach of § es invalidation of ipso facto clauses   by contrast under the delaware llc act the other members of milford power are not excusedagain as a matter of default lawfrom accepting an assignment of pdcs bare economic rights as an equity owner   thus after the dismissal of its bankruptcy filing pdc possessed the same rights as an assignee under § b judge farnans reasoning balances the competing policy interests at stake   in keeping with § b and even §  of the delaware llc act his ruling respects the default law of this state by refusing to permit a debtor to transfer its right to participate “in the management of the business and affairs” and “exercise any governance rights or power of a member” in an llc absent specific contractual authorization  at the same time however he noted that the general assembly had concluded that the economic rights of a member in an llc were as a general matter freely assignable   in other words he concluded that delawares default law specifically distinguished between those aspects of an llc agreement that should not be freely transferable because substitute performance should not be imposed on the other members absent their express consent ie the managerial powers and duties and those aspects that should be freely transferable ie the passive right to share in profits and losses   this distinction like those made by federal law recognizes that it is far more tolerable to have to suffer a new passive coinvestor one did not choose than to endure a new comanager without consent   the same logic applies when a member of an llc must remain in a relationship with a member that has filed for bankruptcy   by terminating the bankrupt filers status as a member with governance rights the solvent members only have to live with the bankrupt filer as an assignee with a passive economic interestnotably this distinction is also reflected in the milford power llc agreement itself   in article  the llc agreement recognizes that there might be circumstances when the company is required to recognize a transfer that has been accomplished in violation of the procedures of the llc agreement itself eg in violation of the first refusal rights granted to other members by article    in the circumstance when “the company is required to recognize such disposition or transfer the units so transferred shall be strictly limited to the transferors rights to allocations and distributions as provided by this agreement with respect to the transferred units․” furthermore as a general matter the milford power llc agreement recognizes that members may have a need to transfer their units and provides procedures by which transfers may be accomplished   although the other members must in most situations provide “prior written consent” to a transfer that consent “cannot be reasonably withheld conditioned or delayed”  of course i recognize that a reasonable mind could conclude that the outcome i reach is neither incontestably required by the applicable law nor economically optimal   one can argue as professor ribstein does that state courts should treat the bankruptcy code as nonpreemptive of ipso facto clauses in nonbankruptcy cases involving limited partnerships and limited liability companies until congress makes its intent to preempt indisputable   by vindicating the contractual expectations of venturers he would say we best promote responsible wealth creation i respect that view as it accords with the public policy of my state as expressed in §  of the delaware llc act his view which was that adopted in chrysler financial also has the virtue of being clear  outside of bankruptcy ipso facto clauses are always enforceable absent a prior federal court order to the contraryon the other hand the position of pdc also has the same virtue of simplicity   if the bankruptcy code is read as erasing the effect of a bankruptcy filing upon a §  dismissal then members of limited partnership or llcs simply have to live with having as a fellow member a person or entity that filed for bankruptcy and had their case dismissed   if the evident intent of congress is to avoid having the simple fact of a bankruptcy filing work a forfeiture on a debtors property interests then state courts should respect that intent and not penalize a debtor whose bankruptcy case is dismissed by subjecting them to a loss of property that they would not have suffered at the hands of a bankruptcy court had their case not been dismissedby adhering to the reasoning of judge farnan in the in re  it case i leave the parties with a more complex outcome   by enforcing the ipso facto clause so as to deprive pdc or a transferee from it of the ability to exercise the strong participatory rights given to pdc by the llc agreement i recognize the legitimate business justification for §  and ipso facto clauses modeled on it a justification wellexplained by professor ribsteins article on the subject   at the very least my approach alleviates the concern that members will because of solvency concerns interfere with the ability of a limited liability company to pursue risky business strategies that hold the promise for large profitsbut by recognizing what i perceive to be the preemptive force of the bankruptcy code on ipso facto clauses to the extent that they deprive an llc member of the economic rights set forth in § b i also respect congresss desire to avoid having property interests of debtors divested simply because the debtors filed for bankruptcy   this desire is not entirely alien to our law as our courts have often noted that delaware law does not favor interpretations that result in forfeitures that is the practical effect of my ruling leaves §  with continued vitality   essentially as i have read it §  means that a member who files for bankruptcy still ceases to be a member but becomes an assignee with the economic rights specified in § bbecause i have concluded that the ipso facto clause cannot be applied to deprive pdc of the economic rights of an assignee i need not determine whether as the plaintiffs contend pdcas a withdrawn memberwould have been deprived entirely of its interest in the profits and losses of milford power   although that appears to be the only sensible reading of the llc agreement i need not and do not rest my conclusion on that groundnotably because i have held that pdc continues to possess the economic rights of an assignee in milford power its argument that the doctrine of unclean hands should bar the plaintiffs claim is further enervated as nothing in this ruling will deprive pdc of the right to share in the proceeds of any sale of the power plant   rather pdc will be deprived of that opportunity only if the lenders are successful in their foreclosure action or for other circumstances that would not flow directly from this decisionvi conclusionfor all these reasons the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is granted in part   pdc has been divested of its right to participate in the management of milford power and only retains the economic rights of a transferee under § b   the plaintiffs shall prepare a conforming final order and submit it to me upon notice to pdc as to form within twenty days   each side shall bear its own costsfootnotes    br  ddel   llc
