accountingyong yu university of texas at austin date written july   abstract this study examines the effect of product market competition on managerial disclosure of earnings forecasts using large reductions in us import tariff rates to identify an exogenous increase in competition for domestic firms in us product markets our differenceindifference estimations show that tariff reductions are associated with a significant decrease in management forecasts of annual earnings by us domestic firms further this decrease is more pronounced when the tariff rate reduction triggers a greater increase in imports and when the forecasts are likely to incur higher proprietary costs our findings are consistent with competition from existing rivals reducing voluntary disclosure through increased proprietary costs keywords competition disclosure proprietary cost tariff rate reduction jel classification g m suggested citation suggested citation huang ying and jennings ross and yu yong
