equestrian joins queen’s diamond jubileeby gwyn mcallister  may   share on facebook tweet on twitter one of four queens diamond jubilee commemorative scarves designed for that event at the royal windsor horse show — photo courtesy of francesca kellyfrancesca kelly of west tisbury a british transplant to martha’s vineyard and owner of marwari horses traveled to england earlier this month to participate in an equestrian event as part of the year long ceremonies honoring queen elizabeth on the occasion of the th year of her reign the fourday diamond jubilee pageant held on the private grounds of windsor castle featured over  horses and more than  dancers musicians and performers from around the worldms kelly along with raghuvendra singh dunlod are cofounders of the indigenous horse society of india the pair brought eight marwaris members of a rare indian breed that was once close to extinction to the celebration marwaris are characterized by their inward turning ear tips and intelligencems kelly produced the asian portion of the program which consisted of seven acts from different parts of the globe the indian spectacle included  traditional dancers a large group of musicians five riders and two trainers performing concurrently was a group of riders from india and pakistan who demonstrated tent pegging a cavalry sport of skill“the horses were racing at full gallop diagonally intersecting the arena with the riders picking out pegs attached to the ground” ms kelly said the costumed dancers — both equine and human performing on adjacent stages — made for a fastpaced colorful spectacle“it was such an honor to be invited to participate” ms kelly said “as a brit to do that in my own country was very emotional for me” after the show ms kelly mr dunlod and three of the dancers were among the guests invited for tea with the queen at windsor castle ms kelly just received a letter of thanks from buckingham palace recognizing her for her participation in the event and thanking her for a set of scarves featuring the marwaris which ms kelly designed and presented to the queenms kelly spends about four months every winter in india where she produces a series of performances tribal dancers and  local marwaris that she maintains as well as choreographing the shows she also performs although she did not perform for the jubilee she also stables horses on chappaquiddickms kelly who comes from a family of british diplomats has been riding since she was three years old and living in egypt in  she and her husband at the time took part in a riding safari in india she fell in love with the indigenous horses the marwari is the most popular of the five breeds that are represented by the indigenous horse society and set up the first major marwari stud farm in india in in  ms kelly and her then husband settled full time at their summer home on chappaquiddick that year she was able to fulfill a longtime dream when she became the first person to export indian horses to the us she brought six horses over to chappy and has been breeding and training them here ever sincedespite increased restrictions on indian horse exports ms kelly is able to arrange for artificial insemination with horses in india “because of my two decades of philanthropic work with the breed i have a certain leeway that is not available to other people” she saysms kelly does not raise the horses for profit but rather to maintain the breed however she has sold a few of her horses including a seed herd of three that went to spain and she has donated three to the nonprofit kentucky horse parktoday she has eight horses in the us and one in england she winters the horses at a farm in new jersey and keeps them here in the summer on land on chappaquiddick that she leases from the sheriff’s meadow foundation the marwaris on chappy attract a lot of attention a photographer included pictures of them in a prestigious salon show in france they will be the subject of an australian documentary next year and ms kelly has published a coffee table book documenting her experience exporting the horses — and is working on a followup both are illustrated with photos by accomplished horse photographer dale durphee of englandms kelly has been able to combine a number of her passions to produce the dancing with horses shows “i love dance i love music and i love the performing horses” she said “it comes quite easily to me to put together a creative performance native to india”ms kelly is devoted to raising awareness of the marwaris working on decreased export restrictions and establishing the breed in the us and elsewhere “the indian horse is without a doubt the oldest horse in the world” she said “they have extraordinarily soulful personalities they’re not what i call horizontal horses — not overly domesticated they’re sensitive they have very special temperaments”the horse that starred in the jubilee pageant was a former chappaquiddick horse named dilraj king of hearts in hindi who ms kelly sent to england in  because he was prone to escaping “he was highspirited he needed to work” she saidnext week the other horses will be returning to the vineyard for the summer “they love the island” ms kelly said “they know the trails this is their home”a documentary on the diamond jubilee pageant will air on british tv on june  it will eventually be seen on american television ms kelly said she also plans to screen it on island somewhere this summer related articlesmore from author communityyard sales july  –  communitysheriff’s meadow foundation

pineapple mint mojito beer ribeye steak grilled peach salad add to cookbooks add to cookbooks add martha stewarts best lemon curd kelly s when martha stewart first published this recipe in her martha stewart living magazine in  she had an entire article explaining the whereshowsand what not to dos with regards to lemon curd i had only ever purchased lemon curd prior to this recipe and wasnt impressed with it too thick too tart and short shelf life for the very high price this recipe changed my mind soft teasingly tart the ability to make it tarter or softer in flavour all had me saying this is the worlds best lemon curd ive never tried another recipe since even marthas new  improved curd recipes where she seems to have forgotten what she taught us fans of hers so many years ago according to the article the reasons why this curd recipe is so superior is the following beating the egg yolks until rich yellow and then straining the first time creates a smooth albumenfree base  cooking the mixture without the zest creates a softer less bitter curd cooked zest just becomes more bitter even without the white pith  a second straining removes any possibility of scrambled eggs from your curd  adding the chilled butter cut into pieces to the eggs does two things it rapidly cools down the curd so it doesnt continue to cook and also the buttery flavour is not changed by cooking with the yolks  adding the zest after the curd is cooled creates a smooth flavourful but not bitter curd are these steps too many for some people oh im sure of it especially the straining steps and some curd recipes have you dump everything together in the pan so that sure makes it simple however after  years of making this one curd recipe ive found the little bit of extra time involved in creating it makes for a superiour end product note if you do not want a dense eggy lemon curd use whole eggs for the recipe rather than egg yolks that would be four whole eggs to the six egg yolks more   photo by none prep time  minutes total time  minutes servings  cups adapted from foodcom ingredients  egg yolks beaten adding whites makes it lighter and less rich  cup sugar ½ cup fresh lemon juice strained ½ cup unsalted butter cold and cut into small pieces to melt faster   tablespoon lemon rind grated directions  beat the egg yolks until well blended and lemon yellow in colour strain the egg yolks through a sieve into a mediumsize heavy saucepan sieving removes any shells or albumen heavy saucpan prevents curdling  add the sugar and lemon juice stir to combine and cook over low heat stirring constantly for about  minutes do not hurry the process or the eggs will curdle  cook until the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon remove from heat and immediately pour through another sieve to catch any scrambled egg bits pour into a heat proof  cup measuring cup and stir in the cold butter pieces which cools down the mixture quickly  add the rind continue stirring until wellblended  transfer to whatever storage container you want either a large one or several samll ones  shelf life must be refrigerated keeps  weeks variations lime curd substitute lime juice and increase grated lime peel to  tablespoons orange curd use orange juice decrease sugar to  cup  tablespoon orange peel grapefruit curd use grapefruit juice same sugar and zest as lemon curd
