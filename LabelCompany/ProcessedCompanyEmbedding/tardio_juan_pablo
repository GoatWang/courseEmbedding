financial officer replacing longtime executive doug fears who is retiring what is the biggest challenge of this new job and how does a contract drilling company maintain fiscal stability when the pace of drilling rises and falls with steep price fluctuationsdoug is an extraordinary role model i was fortunate to have the opportunity to thoroughly review the tasks and challenges at hand with him and the transition has gone very wellthe greatest challenge so far is identifying areas where we can create additional value maintaining fiscal stability is certainly a high priority we believe we have the most capable land drilling fleet and organization in the industry which has allowed us to generate premium margins and premium utilization rates and has enabled us to secure a baseline of future earnings through firm longterm contracts helmerich  payne has been in business for  years is directional drilling the biggest innovation during that time and will we see any similar game changers technologywise in the near futuredirectional drilling in the new shale plays has certainly been a game changer in the us over the last five to  years it has allowed natural gas reserves to unexpectedly become abundant in this countryinnovative technology applied to new and better drilling rigs drill bits fluids directional drilling tools and frac completion methods have allowed highly productive gas shale wells to be drilled effectively and at a reasonable costgiven our countrys heavy dependence on crude oil imports the next potential game changer may very well be cracking the code in more successfully exploiting oil and other liquids trapped in us shale rock what makes your companys flexrig so different from competing rigs can you tell us a little about its evolutionthe difference is productivity and reliability a customer will achieve significant cost savings per well if our product can significantly reduce the time that it takes to drill the well flexrigs have demonstrated the ability to improve drilling productivity and in many cases help our customers attain significant cost savingsthe flexrig story takes us back to  when helmerich  payne completed its first generation of these drilling units during the last decade three additional generations were introduced all of which focused on applying innovative technology to make the drilling process more efficient we also focused significant efforts on additional safety features and on improving the rigs ability to move more quickly from well to well  a month the new cost for doing business in tulsa

venezuela has devalued its currency and still owes hp more than  million would the company ever consider pulling out of venezuela entirelywe have reduced our number of rigs in venezuela by half since  at that time almost  percent of our land rigs were in that country compared to under  percent of our land rigs todaywe decided not to enter new contracts in venezuela last year given invoice payment delays by our customer pdvsa as a result the  rigs that we have in that country — all of which are older conventional rigs — are now idleour future in venezuela will depend on evolving market conditions there and around the world so many energysector companies have either merged or moved out of tulsa to houston are there any factors that could compel hp to movefor almost a century the
