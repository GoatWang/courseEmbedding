nineteenthcentury collecting and the british museum from nineveh to new york the strange story of the assyrian reliefs in the metropolitan museum and the hidden masterpiece at canford school by john malcolm russell pp  new haven ct and london yale university press in association with the metropolitan museum of art 99  £ a w franks nineteenthcentury collecting and the british museum edited by marjorie caygill and john cherry pp ix   london british museum press 99 £ together these works display a fascinating variety of practices in victorian antiquarianism collecting and display both within and beyond the british museum at the same time they display almost as clearly the different kinds of concerns assumptions and even anxieties brought by different contemporary scholars as the activities of in the best sense end page 98 of the word amateur collectors are refracted in the various lenses of modern disciplinary perspectives the subject matter of the two works is not only complementary but even directly overlaps at points the strange story told by the archaeologist john malcolm russell is the tale of a particular group of ancient assyrian artifacts excavated in mesopotamia presentday iraq by austen henry layard in the 8s objects the fate of which was distinct from the vast majority destined for the british museum rather this particular group of ancient wingedanimal statues and intricate relief scenes was sent directly by layard to a private home that of john and charlotte guest at canford manor in dorset the nineveh porch which was displayed there for decades is as russell points out the only major display of assyrian antiquities that has ever been mounted outside of a museum russells goal is to trace the itinerary of these artifacts from their ancient past through their postdiscovery lives canford was only the first stop as he details in a later section of the book most of the artifacts were shopped around major american museums in the earliertwentieth century and ultimately found their way into the metropolitan museum indeed the author is directly responsible for the strangest of all these stories to which a final chapter is devoted in the early 99s russell visited the porch at canford the estate has long since been converted into a boys school and determined that not all the assyrian originals had been sold off the objects that he authenticated with experts from the british museum were subsequently sold at auction setting a new record price for antiquities russell brings to his subject then not only the perspective of an archaeologist but also a personal interest and indeed an active role in the very story he tells this shapes the narrative in several ways few archaeologists of the ancient near east have written extensively on the history of assyrian discoveries in a field more dominated by art historians and cultural historians russell brings a striking and welcome exactitude in his treatment of individual artifacts telling the reader precisely from which walls of which rooms of which ancient palaces particular artifacts were derived similarly a central focus of the book is his precise reconstruction of canfords nineveh porchnot only the ordering of artifacts but their complete structural and aesthetic surrounding it is a singular and welcome achievement at the same time some of the concerns of the contemporary archaeologist deflect subtly and not so subtly the particularities of the nineteenthcentury situation thus russell refers to layards discoveries in the ruins of nineveh and babylon 8 as his second excavation report  when indeed this book and its precursor layards nineveh and its remains  bear little resemblance to the genre today archaeology if you would like to
