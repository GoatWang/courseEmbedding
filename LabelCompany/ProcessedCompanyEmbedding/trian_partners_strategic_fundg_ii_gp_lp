revitalizepgcom   new york july  — trian fund management lp “trian” whose investment funds beneficially own approximately  billion of shares of the procter  gamble company nyse pg “pg” or the “company” today filed a preliminary proxy statement with the securities and exchange commission for the election of nelson peltz its chief executive officer and founding partner to pg’s board of directors at the  annual meeting of shareholders as one of pg’s largest shareholders and given pg’s disappointing results over the past decade trian has a keen interest in helping the company address the challenges it is facing which include   weak total shareholder returns – over the past decade pg has underperformed relative to both its peers and the sp   over a year period pg’s total return to shareholders was less than half that of its peers and has been in the bottom quartile over most recent time frames  trian believes pg needs to address the factors contributing to this consistent underperformance including deteriorating market share – over the past five years pg’s organic sales growth has decelerated and the company has lost market share across most of its categories  · organic sales and volume growth have been well below that of traditional largecap consumer packaged goods peers · disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer packaged goods industry including changes in technology and consumer behavior and pg must act with the greatest possible urgency to address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller local competitors who are adapting to industry changes more effectively than pg   excessive cost and bureaucracy – pg management acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy  but it is clear to trian that these critical issues have not been sufficiently addressed ·   trian’s analysis shows that pg’s  billion costcutting program launched in  has had no discernible impact on profits or sales growth     o   to the extent savings were reinvested to drive growth there was little impact on organic volume growth which was among the worst in class relative to peers from  to  and market shares declined   o   savings did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit was essentially flat from  to     ·   although pg has stated that it has identified up to  billion of additional cost savings given the company’s track record trian is concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the  program in driving sales growth earnings growth and shareholder value creation   ·   pg has an overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving and insular culture     o   structural and organizational bureaucracy prevents management from identifying and responding to commercial opportunities in a timely manner hinders product innovation and dampens sales growth    while pg leadership says they are addressing the underperformance issue shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results have not improved  trian believes pg must take decisive action that goes above and beyond what pg has presently committed to do       adding nelson peltz to the board will help pg address these challenges – trian believes that mr peltz’s significant expertise and long track record of working successfully with management teams and boards to turn around consumer companies and drive sustainable longterm shareholder value will be invaluable to pg as it works to overcome its challenges ·   at consumer companies where mr peltz has served on the board of directors earningspershare growth has outpaced the sp   by an average of  basis points annually  ·   total shareholder returns at consumer companies where mr peltz has served on the board of directors have outperformed the sp  by an average of  basis points annually    trian believes that pg’s challenges stem in large part from its organizational structure and culture which can be highly resistant to change therefore it is trian’s strong view that the addition of a motivated independent director that has a material ownership stake and relevant industry experience can be a valuable resource for overcoming the root causes of these challenges   what trian is not pushing for – trian believes strongly in pg’s potential and as a longterm shareowner its objective is to create sustainable long term shareholder value for all pg shareholders that means trian is ·   not advocating for the breakup of the company ·   not suggesting that the ceo be replaced ·   not seeking to replace directors ·   not advocating taking on excessive leverage ·   not seeking to cut pension benefits ·   not suggesting that research  development marketing expense or capital expenditures be reduced   trian has made the decision to nominate mr peltz for election to the board at the  annual meeting so that he can act as a catalyst for faster and more significant change at pg in connection with this nomination trian has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and launched the website wwwrevitalizepgcom which contains a brief shareholder presentation and other materials   “trian believes the job of a highly engaged shareowner in the boardroom is to foster a true sense of ownership among directors and inspire the board to take decisive and timely action to create sustainable longterm value for both the company and its shareholders” said mr peltz “as a member of the board it would be my goal to help improve performance by increasing sales and profits and regaining lost market share i also believe the board must address the company’s structure and culture i can add far more value operating within the pg boardroom than by merely looking in from the outside”   wishing to avoid a proxy contest trian had numerous constructive meetings and discussions with pg management and a few board members over the course of the past four months trian is disappointed that the company has rejected trian’s request to expand the board by adding mr peltz who would be a representative of all shareholders trian still hopes to avoid the distraction of a proxy contest for the sake of all constituencies however it feels compelled to advocate for the changes it believes are necessary at pg in order to enhance longterm value and return pg to its position as the bestinclass consumer packaged goods company in terms of growing both market share and financial performance should mr peltz be elected to a seat on pg’s board at its annual meeting as a director his first action     would be to propose that the board immediately reappoint to the board whichever current director has not been reelected   nelson peltz’s background and experience nelson peltz is the chief executive officer  founding
