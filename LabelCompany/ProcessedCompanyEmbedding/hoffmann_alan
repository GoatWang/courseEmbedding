sports herbalife people herbalife innovation herbalife community herbalife executive vice president alan hoffman from the white house to our house when you’re responsible for shaping the perception of a political candidate you must define who they are and what they stand for the same thing goes when you are responsible for helping to shape the messaging of a global nutrition company like herbalife related article des walsh president of herbalife fosters success by championing a culture of new ideas just ask herbalife executive vice president global corporate affairs alan hoffman who has also served as deputy chief of staff to vice president joseph biden and deputy assistant to president barack obama “not all companies are created equal” says hoffman “we are open about who we are and because of that you can only come away being impressed with us” alan is responsible for public policy corporate communications government affairs community relations and all philanthropic efforts on behalf of herbalife including the herbalife family foundation he joined the company in  when herbalife chairman and chief executive officer michael o johnson asked him to spread the word about all of the positive things herbalife is doing “michael is one of the key reasons i came to herbalife” says hoffman “he’s infectious dynamic a great leader and i knew i could learn a lot from him he gives me the autonomy to do my job he gives me goals and says go make them happen he and joe biden are very similar in that way” alan’s overarching goal at the company is to clearly define for the world who herbalife is and what it aspires to be which might be best summed up by the mission statement written on the whiteboard in his office to be the premier nutrition company in the world “there’s a genius in this company with its desire and ability to improve lives with good nutrition as well as the economic opportunity it presents to those who are interested” says hoffman “we are not always perceived the way that we know the company is in actuality i want to change the narrative and the way people think about us if we want to be known as the premier nutrition company in the world we have to do everything in our power to make ourselves a part of the conversation” so what is hoffman doing to help shine a light on the many great things that herbalife is doing it’s a multiyear and multifaceted effort part of which involves deploying tens of thousands of independent herbalife members who are already thoroughly engaged in their communities to spread the word about the company recent herbalife rallies in los angeles and chicago have been tremendously effective in generating awareness for the company and its products partnerships with the special olympics world games and the american red cross have lent the company a high degree of credibility while also providing it with greater visibility herbalife has also been doing more traditional media finding success with a televised commercial that ran in miami and los angeles in early 5 herbalife is proud to have on its side someone like hoffman who is a champion of everything the company is and stands for and the feeling is mutual “coming to work for herbalife was a great decision” says hoffman “we are moving forward in all aspects of the business as we continuously ‘build it better’” « herbalife is changing the way the
