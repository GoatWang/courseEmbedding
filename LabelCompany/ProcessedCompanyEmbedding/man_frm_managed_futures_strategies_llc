on an accrual basis dividend income net of applicable withholding taxes and dividend expenses on securities sold short are recorded on the exdividend date d fair value of financial instruments definition and hierarchy derivative contracts are carried at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques is used in measuring fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below � level  � unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  � quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly level  � prices or valuation that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable � � valuation investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets and are therefore classified within level  include active listed equities the master fund does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments even in situations where the master fund holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices for an identical instrument dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within level  as level  investments include positions that are not traded in active markets andor are subject to transfer restrictions valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor non�transferability which are generally based on available market information investments classified within level  have significant unobservable inputs as they trade infrequently or not at all level  instruments include private placements when observable prices are not available for these securities the investment manager uses one or more valuation techniques eg the market approach or the income approach for which sufficient and reliable data is available within level  the use of the market approach generally consists of using comparable market transactions while the use of the income approach generally consists of the net present value of estimated future cash flows adjusted as appropriate for liquidity credit market and or other risk factors the inputs used by the investment manager in estimating the value of level  investments include the original transaction price recent transactions in the same or similar instruments completed or pending thirdparty transactions in the underlying investment or comparable issuers subsequent rounds of financing recapitalisations and other transactions across the capital structure offerings in the equity or debt capital markets and changes in financial ratios or cash flows level  investments may also be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or nontransferability with the amount of such discount estimated by the investment manager in the absence of market information the fair value measurement of level  investments does not include transaction costs that may have been capitalised as part of the security�s cost basis assumptions used by the investment manager due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the master fund�s results of operations derivative instruments can be exchangetraded or privately negotiated overthecounter �otc� otc derivatives are valued by the master fund using observable inputs such as quotations received from the counterparty dealers or brokers whenever available and considered reliable in instances where models are used the value of an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability and reliability of observable inputs these otc derivatives that have less liquidity or for which inputs are unobservable are classified within level  while the valuations of these less liquid otc derivatives may utilise some level  andor level  inputs they also include other unobservable inputs which are considered significant to the fair value determination at each measurement date the investment manager updates the level  and level  inputs to reflect observable inputs though the resulting gains and losses are reflected within level  due to the significance of the unobservable inputs  � campbell mac cayman fund limited notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended  december
