quarter of  and how that shapes our view of the coming year well walk you through financial results we released earlier this morning and then open the call to your questions before we begin i must as always remind you that everything we cover during todays call including questions and answers is subject to forwardlooking statements that are included in our k let me now turn it over to bob moran our interim ceo robert f moran thanks amy and good morning everyone when we talked at this time last quarter gnc had just opened its stores as a new and fundamentally transformed business model one that is designed around the customer leverage our core strength and competitive advantages and is built to deliver meaningful profitable growth looking at the first quarter results from the one new gnc we are encouraged and excited by the progress of the business our goal was to bring consumers back to gnc with simplified competitive pricing compelling loyalty programs innovative and exclusive products and a dramatically improved customer experience its clear that customers are coming back to our stores in the first quarter transactions in our companyowned stores were up  the strongest growth this company has seen in years we were particularly encouraged by how transactions and customers conversions ramped throughout the quarter and while up across the board the original pilot markets are continuing to outpace the rest of the chain that were converted at the end of december we are also pleased with our gnccom business which while down  is a significant improvement compared to the down  that we experienced in the fourth quarter we are encouraged with this performance and continue to aim for positive comps from this group in the back half of the year we believe that there were a few factors that helped to drive growth at gnccom first our amazoncom marketplace is outperforming our sales expectation and is leading with strong sales of gnc branded products secondly during the quarter we invested in an online marketing campaign that we believe generated a significant return on investment and helped to elevate our share of voice during the quarter and lastly the expanded assortment of products available online also helped to drive sales but most encouraging is the performance of our new mygnc rewards loyalty program which puts us in a strong position as we head into the rest of  we now have  million members enrolled in the new mygnc program and in the first quarter loyalty customers shopped more frequently we are pleased that we are seeing former gold card members signing up for the new loyalty program while also attracting large numbers of new members on average our members visited stores  times this quarter when you consider that the typical member of our old and outdated gold card visited just four times in an entire year and that mygnc rewards members are tracking to come six times a year you see what the new program is capable of delivering we launched the pro access program in late march and already have almost  new members the program which combines traditional benefits like free shipping and points incentives with more premium offerings tailored to individual interests purchase habits and needs is resonating with our core and most profitable customer segment the health enthusiast but the true power of mygnc and pro access is capturing the email addresses which coupled with the customer data makes customized marketing much more costeffective and efficient than it was for us in the past under our prior gold card program while we had approximately  million members we had only workable email addresses for only  of them and customized communication with them through direct mail which was much more expensive than targeted email campaigns our new program requires email address for each member so that we can now communicate in a more costeffective and timely manner now that were using the rich data we get from our new loyalty programs to narrowly target offers recommend regimens and solutions and incent behaviors based on customers specific detailed shopping habits and patterns in an industry where consumers are looking for trusted advice something that just cant get online with mass competitors personalization matters and creates significant opportunities for our business lets talk about pricing which is a foundational element of the one new gnc strategy as you know we moved from multiple levels of pricing to a known valueadded price strategy at the end of q and we believe the change is helping fuel positive transaction trends today we are sharply priced in categories that shape customers perceptions and we are able to take some margin in areas where there is much more flexibility were also significantly reducing the number of buy one and get one offers which while they drove higher average ticket also had the potential to encourage pantry loading in favor of percent off promotions that capture consumers attention drive traffic frequency and promote trial when we compare this years first quarter to the prior year period there are several marked differences we had more than  reduction in the average number of skus on promotion a greater than  reduction in the average number of items on bogo during the period and no allstore bogo days compared to  in the prior year period change at this level is never easy and in the short term we are feeling the impact on basket size into our margins due to the investments that we have made in price and promotions getting customers back in the store is the first critical step and is exactly what we are doing from here we have plenty of opportunities to increase average ticket we continue to train associates in solutionsbased selling supported by technology and instore marketing which should be on display by early may were building and promoting additional regimens and we are adding new grabngo product offerings to the assortment these initiatives all have basket building power and we expect to gain traction on that front beginning in the back half of the year we believe that the incremental training the pilot markets received helped them transition the customers over to the new format and that subsequent training will be beneficial to the entire chain we are also focused on reinvigorating privatelabel innovation which has historically been a competitive strength this work includes developing new products and formulas that address unmet customer needs and expanding customer brands like beyond raw mega men womens ultra mega and gnc probiotics innovation is the key to our product assortment and we are working to optimize the assortment and have projects underway to improve product turns in stocks and rightsize inventories in stores our dcs and manufacturing before i turn it over to tricia id like to spend just a few minutes on marketing and specifically on our super bowl strategy our plan was to launch the one new gnc using the super bowl including not just the game day ad but the ongoing campaign social media outreach and pr that comes with it vox suddenly and inexplicitly pulled our campaign just days before the super bowl we are currently assessing the extent of these damages and well then take appropriate action as disappointed as we were we continue to believe we are on the right track as we shift away from brand building and focus on customer acquisition and driving traffic we are telling customers about the one new gnc and inviting them to come back and as we saw in the first quarter customers are responding and while there is still a great deal of work to do we feel good about the trends that were seeing and believe we have created a business model that can deliver results with that ill hand it over to tricia for a look at our first quarter numbers tricia k tolivar good morning everyone during the first quarter we saw continued strength in transactions offset by softness in average basket due to both investments that we have made and price and the lapping in promotions that occurred during the prior year period importantly we believe that the positive transaction trends point to the consumers receptiveness to the changes we have implemented as part of the one new gnc for the quarter our consolidated revenue decreased  to  million revenue was down by  yearoveryear in our us and canada segment during the first quarter and at  in our international segment while manufacturingwholesale revenue excluding intersegment sales decreased  excluding gains on refranchising in both periods and the legal charge related to the outcome of litigation adjusted eps was  this quarter compared to  in the prior year period first quarter samestore sales including gnccom decreased  in domestic companyowned stores with the biggest declines coming from protein vitamins weight management and food and drink which was partially offset by strong performance from the health and beauty and performance supplement categories as we defined in the earnings release samestore sales exclude sales of all membership programs so the gold card and pro access sales have no impact to comp its product only we shared the previous eight quarters in  and  under our revised definition in our earnings release last quarter we had a  decline in gnccom sales as we better aligned online and instore pricing and promotions with that work behind us and the added benefit of our launch on the amazon marketplace and our investment in an online marketing campaign we saw a decrease of just  in the first quarter of  and are encouraged by this performance and as bob said we believe that this will help gnccom achieve positive comps in the back half of the year in domestic franchise locations samestore sales decreased  during the first quarter for the quarter transaction and average basket were up  and declined  respectively our international business grew during the first quarter with a  localcurrency samestore sales helping drive a  increase in revenue and a  growth in operating income we are beginning to see some improved business trends in mexico south korea and hong kong revenues in the manufacturingwholesale business excluding intersegment sales declined  for the quarter thirdparty contract manufacturing continued to increase up almost  for the first quarter sales to wholesale partners decreased  compared to the prior year period due primarily to a rationalization of skus sold to a warehouse the wholesale club partner and intersegment sales decreased  primarily due to lower gnc branded product sales in the us and canada first quarter gross profit as a percent of sales was  compared to last year we experienced softer gross margins in the first quarter driven by deleveraging and occupancy costs associated with negative samestore sales and by lower domestic retail product margins partially offset by the recognition of the remaining  million in deferred revenue associated with the gold card program and prior year deep discount on excess vitamins backing out the benefit of gold card revenue net of coupon redemptions our gross margin for the quarter would have been  which is significantly below we believe our gross profit margin will be for the full year we believe that a more normalized level for the remainder of  is in the  to  range improving as we move through the back half of the year and begin to see the benefit of margin enhancing programs we have put in place that are designed to shift product mix and our costs excluding a legal charge related to a uk license agreement sga in the first quarter was  of sales thats up a bit from where weve been in the past due to increased marketing costs to support the media campaign around the one new gnc launch and online advertising during the first quarter we saw a strong to return on the dollars we invested in online marketing and as such have continued to invest in the second quarter if we continue to see the return we may make the decision to allocate incremental dollars behind online marketing in the back half of  let me take a few minutes to go through some of the changes that we are seeing in the business since the introduction of the one new gnc as bob told you our pricing and promotional strategies are proving their worth in bringing customers back to gnc we are pleased with the cadence of strengthening transactions at companyowned stores through the first quarter with january up  february up  and march up  after several years of consistent transaction declines largely selfinflicted due to the consumers perception that we were overpriced as the old pricing model was confusing we are very pleased that the consumers are coming back to gnc as we look at the rollout of the pricing and segregate the stores by time of launch there are three different groups of stores the original  pilot stores launched in september group two the  stores converted in october and the rest of the chain at the end of december so the first quarter the original pilot group experienced a yearoveryear  lift in transactions offset by a  yearoveryear decline in average basket resulting in a flat samestore sales in the second group of stores that converted to the one new gnc in october for the first quarter we experienced a  increase in transactions yearoveryear a  yearoveryear decline in average basket resulting in a  increase in samestore sales lastly in the rest of the chain those stores that converted on december   for the first quarter we saw an  increase in transactions yearoveryear and a  drop in average basket resulting in a samestore sales decline of  as we have discussed on prior calls we made a conscious choice to invest in price and believe it was fundamental to getting customers back into the stores and to remove the perception issues about the pricevalue proposition that gnc offers we are aware that it will take time to change perception and recover basket but believe that we are on the right path and are encouraged by what we are seeing we are pleased that the pilot stores continue to generate transaction results which are better than the rest of the chain continuing the trends that began at the launch of each pilot all three groups saw a slowdown in basket recovery and transaction growth during february as we lapped a particularly aggressive promotional campaign ph in the prior year period and bob mentioned in his comments the prior year quarter was fairly heavy with allstore bogos four days in february and six days in march the bogo events tended to drive average basket size the extent of future transactions and frequency in the second and third quarter there are several periods of allstore bogos that we have to anniversary in the second quarter there were six allstore bogo days in may six days in june and in the third quarter there are also six days in september we estimate that on average each allstore bogo drove approximately  in incremental sales per day as bob mentioned were also very pleased with the improved customer conversion trends that weve been seeing prior to the december th launch pilot stores in malls and strip centers both saw conversion list of  and  respectively since the implementation of the new pricing both pilot markets and the rest of the chain stores are continuing to see improvements in conversion as we stated in the first quarter based on these trends and our focus on improving average ticket we believe our samestore sales will sequentially strengthen over the course of fiscal  and still expect them to turn positive in the back half of the year looking at the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with  million in net cash from operating activities we invested  million in capital expenditures and generated  million in free cash flow as we indicated last quarter for fiscal  we are still planning fewer new store openings and less spending on it and still expect capex to be approximately  million a  million reduction from the prior year further we expect  free cash flow to be in excess of  million as we discussed last quarter we plan to use cash that previously would have been allocated to our dividend or in prior quarters to share repurchases to lower our debt levels focusing first on paying down our revolver this is a sharp departure from our previous strategy but we believe it is important to invest in the successful turnaround in the business its our intention to move towards a longterm adjusted leverage ratio of approximately x with rent capitalized at x and to take a disciplined approach to inventory management and capital expenditures working capital initiatives should drive incremental nearterm debt reduction opportunities at the end of  the vast majority more than  of our stores generated positive cash flow and are ebitda positive like other retailers in the market we will continue to reevaluate our real estate portfolio and make changes we feel are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders as we said last quarter this is an entirely new business model we are managing and modelling it completely differently than we have in the past were very excited about the progress that we have made in a short period of time but with any new business we believe it is prudent to see additional results and trends before we give detailed guidance as we said last quarter and continue to believe we still expect to return to positive samestore sales and begin to see quarteronquarter margin rate and dollar benefit in the back half of the year as we get through a full annual cycle we should begin to see those improvements drop to the bottom line as we have mentioned in the past it takes a  samestore sales comp for us to see benefit of operating leverage with that ill turn it back to bob for some quick closing comments robert f moran thanks tricia i think its clear that with first quarter of performance from our new business model behind us we are encouraged by the trends that were seeing we have changed this business in a fundamental way and while there is still work to do and investments to make were confident that the one new gnc can and will deliver meaningful results for our shareholders operator lets open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions for the first question well go to sean kras of barclays sean stephen kras of the  million customers that joined the rewards program how many were previously gold card members robert f moran this is bob moran actually its  million so lets keep that going but it was about  was gold card members tricia k tolivar identifiable gold card members robert f moran identifiable gold card members sean stephen kras okay and maybe can you tell us a little bit about what you have learned about the mygnc rewards members that were not previously gold card members what are these folks buying in the stores and how frequently are they purchasing and things like that tricia k tolivar so the gold card members – excuse me the new mygnc rewards members are coming into our stores and we actually talked about how their frequency is about  times in the quarter alone so that frequency if you go back and look at the patterns of buying of our historical gold card members they would only come four times per year so if we assume that this frequency levels that the new members in this mygnc rewards program continues throughout the rest of  we are on a trajectory to have consumers come six times per year and their spend frankly is higher than what the gold card customer was spending so were seeing very positive behaviors coming out of these new members sean stephen kras and just a clarification on that are the folks who were previously gold card members are they coming back in excess of  times are they also sort of in that range tricia k tolivar i dont have that answer right in front of me but my expectation is that they would be – their frequency will be consistent with what we are seeing but i dont have that specific data sean stephen kras okay and then just one more for me tricia you alluded to the opportunity to work with product partners to lower costs im just wondering if you could give us a sense of maybe the size of that opportunity and is this something we could start seeing in the numbers this quarter tricia k tolivar so we are in discussions with our partners their relationship is very important to us and well continue to work those throughout the year and i would expect to see improvements in our margins in the back half as those negotiations and dollars materialize in the results sean stephen kras got it thanks guys operator well move on to our next question which will come from chris horvers of jp morgan chris horvers a question im trying to peel back the comp and see what the underlying trend is here clearly you are showing very nice traffic and momentum during the quarter with the earliest converted stores can you talk about the timing of the advertising campaign did that sort of coincide with that acceleration in traffic during the quarter and how do you think about the sustainability of that and then secondly remind us of what – if i was an existing gold card member and lets say i still had six months to go on my membership at the end of december i got autoconverted into new program did i get a coupon and did that encourage me to come back or was that coupon used on that transaction the next time i came in the store just trying to get a sense of how much those two factors perhaps helped the overall comp and traffic robert f moran chris this is bob let me kick off with the ad campaign we started off in january with about  million marketing impressions which obviously was to kickstart the program and then it was go post a lead to the super bowl which obviously we got kicked out about six days beforehand which did have an impact on it and if you think about the super bowl its one of the classic viewing sites we are actually advertising and watching the commercials become sort of an art so we missed that on that and we had to go to a plan b so we got marketing impressions but not as strong lift as we would have gotten from the super bowl and the momentum is still carrying through march but that was really the big push it was really the first quarter the push now is really to our associates and the conversations that they are having with the customers as they come in the store and we are continuing to do marketing but not at the level of january and february but on the – you asked about the question about gold card members yes we did give a coupon to gold card members one to recognize their value to us and also recognize how we could include them into the one new gnc and i think that was wellreceived by a lot of the gold card members and i cant remember what the other question was tricia k tolivar so on that point on the gold card members to give you some perspective chris that we only had  million in coupon redemptions related to that campaign and that was disclosed in the earnings release so its a very small part although it was important to the launch to make sure we appease the gold card customer and thank them for their purchase and rewarded – compensated them for that it didnt have a significant impact on the transaction counts that you are seeing so one other thing i just want to reinforce that we did change our samestore sales reporting so if you were to look apples to apples comparison to how we reported in the past with gold card samestore sales would have been down  but we think its critical to focus on product comps and really the reason behind our change is to match what we believe is important from a key performance indicator perspective and we did a lot of research on how others are treating membership programs and we modelled ourselves against costco in our approach at how we are looking at comps and focusing on product comps going forward and bob talked about this from a marketing perspective and how we can leverage going forward we have this  million mygnc reward members and we are able to leverage their emails much more effectively through a crm basis to drive the traffic going forward chris horvers understood and then just a cleanup question on the gross margin should we think about the benefit to gross margin is it the net  million or is it the gross  million as it relates for this quarter related to the membership change tricia k tolivar so in the quarter there is a benefit of  million that will not replicate in future quarters and if you adjust the gross profit margins and exclude it it will go from  to  chris horvers okay so its not the net  million its the gross  million tricia k tolivar if you look yearoveryear its in that  million impact but that  million will not replicate in second third or fourth quarter chris horvers understood thanks very much operator and next well go to shane higgins of deutsche bank shane higgins i first just wanted to drill down i think bob you said you guys had about  pro access members so far and can you just remind us when – i believe you guys rolled that out at the very end of the quarter so i guess thats for the first couple of weeks how is that trending relative to your expectations and whats kind of i dont know if you want to give the exact target for the year but kind of whats your expectations in terms of the membership fees that could be generated from that program and how much of the gold card membership fee income do you think that could replace robert f moran you are right shane we did kick it off at the end of march and we did that purposefully because as we were layering in the new gnc and really going from the old gnc to the new gnc we really didnt want to burden our sales associates with too many conversations so one we wanted to kick off the pricing we wanted to kick off the mygnc free rewards and then couple that with the pro access at the end of march so two weeks prior we went through extensive training we were in progress that we have about  at this point in time the target at the end of the year we havent disclosed but its ultimately down the road and we think its going to take a year well end up getting to a point where we can match up to the revenues that we have from the gold card and again these are the customers that really are health enthusiasts that spend more and visit us more so we are very excited about adding that program on the features that we have today its a dynamic program its meant to keep on adding features to it and as we add features obviously were going to have stronger conversations as we go through it we are having a lot of success in about  of the stores and obviously right now we are concentrating on the other  to help them understand the program better and go in and maybe change some of our conversations that we have to have with our consumers but we feel that right now we are very happy with where we are today and where we are expecting the progress through the end of year shane higgins okay i appreciate that color and just switching gears real quick to the balance sheet i dont think tricia you addressed this but your net debt to ebitda increased a bit by my math i think it was around x at the end of the quarter could you just provide an update on where you stand with respect to your covenants today and if you guys have had any discussions with your lenders about potentially extending your revolver or term loan just to maybe give you guys some additional headroom while you execute your new strategy tricia k tolivar sure shane so i believe were at x and we are closely monitoring our cash flows and our projected cash flows are sufficient to meet our needs and dont give us any concern with our existing agreements we are in compliance and anticipate that we will remain in compliance throughout  but we certainly are monitoring the market and we intend to approach the market with something in the nearterm to address our upcoming maturities shane higgins okay so just to be clear you guys dont expect your financial covenants to impact your operating flexibility in any way over the next few quarters tricia k tolivar we do not shane higgins okay thanks ill yield operator well move to our next question which will come from peter benedict of robert w baird peter benedict first question just bob talk a little bit more about strategies to build basket and obviously the transactions are coming back but is it more about training in stores i think you alluded to some things around technology coming to stores in may maybe expand on that and are there any adjacent categories that you are considering as you think about how the store might look going forward robert f moran its good question peter yes definitely the opportunity we have we want to utilize some of our competitive advantages which is our backroom and our backroom is about our science our quality of products and our knowledge of the products and then coupling that with what we consider to be optimum regimens is really key to our conversations with the consumer and if you think about this with the mygnc and also the pro access we have incredible insight to what customer is buying but then we can fit them into optimum regimens and through that we can incent through our crm program how do you get one more item into or towards that optimum regimen or solutions that youre trying to do continued training is incredibly important and thats something that we will continue to do and weve found that in the past our training was around how do we sell more gold card now our training is about how to be a trusted advisor how do we give you solutions to your needs be it running a marathon to not sleeping through the night or recovering from cancer treatments these are things that we are trying to do we are building bundles to support the regimens we are also focusing on grabngo type of products that basically are in the register they are basically  very attractive as we do that were looking at our products and obviously we got new innovation coming in and new products coming in through the course of the year that will be very exciting that will also drive conversations and again the key here is the conversation between our associate and our customer and ive said before and what we say here in the company our most valuable piece of real estate is the three feet between one of our associates and one of our consumers so that we can actually have that conversation we could become a trusted advisor and we can recommend solutions to their needs and if you really think about our competition when you go to the aisle its about selfselection and selfselection is not the only thing our consumers are looking for they are really looking for somebody that has experienced it or have seen somebody experience what they are looking for and a change in their lifestyle we think this is very exciting and cant do it overnight when youre changing a culture that selling gold cards or explaining a pricing proposition thats really difficult to understand to now where we are talking about regimens and lifestyles changes it takes a little bit of time and you can see that in the pilot stores as we are picking up momentum in the pilot stores not only more transactions more frequency but were starting to work on that basket in those areas and were pretty excited about what were seeing so a lot of work to be done a lot more to add and i hate to say it the hardest part of this was will the consumers come back and were seeing that the consumers are coming back now we are back to retailing  how do we add one more item to the basket and i think we are very capable of doing that peter benedict thats helpful and i think you alluded to technology coming in may i mean can you expand on that robert f moran we have invested in the stores with new registers and also tablets and obviously as we are working on putting content in to support our sales associates because its impossible to know every single ingredient or every single benefit of every single product and what we want to do is help them with the tablets with that type of content so they can actually add value to the conversations that they have and use our backroom expertise which i think is far superior than anybody else out there tricia k tolivar and part of whats coming in may is additional marketing collateral instore to help support those discussions around solutionbased selling and regimens indiscernible other displays to help assist the associates in the selling process with the consumer peter benedict okay thats helpful and then just my other followup question just around the competitive environment and any response that youve been seeing in the market to your new pricing posture and i mean what comment can you give us around that robert f moran the only changes we have seen i mean in the specialty area we have seen competitors doing lot more bogos which we are shying away from because we felt that during the bogo the added value the days before and the days after they took value away so when you kind of added up the whole process it didnt really add a lot of value but were starting to see a little bit more promotional activity within the competitive landscape but we intend to respond appropriately and we are getting smarter with our promotions instead of doing broad based rush were looking at categories that actually drive traffic and that are meaningful to the customer and especially with the pricing perception i think thats critical as we go forward peter benedict okay it makes sense thanks very much operator now well take a question from simeon gutman of morgan stanley joshua siber its joshua siber on for simeon im curious what percent of the sales from q came from the new customers versus existing customers and of the existing customers are they buying the core products that you have always had or some of the newer products that youre just introducing tricia k tolivar so theres a good balance between new and existing customers in our sales results there is a little bit of an opportunity to assess the data more because we have  million members in our mygnc rewards program nearly as many members as we had in our gold card program historically and creating that connection to those mygnc rewards members were they in fact truly gold card customers in the past so what we have seen with the data that we have is that there is a significant number of new customers and there is a healthy balance of new and existing and the existing customers appear to be spending in a similar way that they have in the past in similar categories joshua siber are you still working with dunnhumby to mine the data tricia k tolivar we are not working with dunnhumby per se but we are certainly using their methods inhouse so we have developed that expertise by partnering with dunnhumby for a number of years and have brought that inhouse over the past several months and are leveraging it in a very similar way joshua siber okay my followup question relates to the amazon store front curious what your expectations are for online and store cannibalization and what the product margins look like relative to the rest of the store tricia k tolivar what we find with our omnichannel customers is we actually see that they spend more in store when they are omnichannel so it boosts both the brick and mortar experience and the online experience and specifically with amazon we are seeing a very high mix of gnc branded products the consumer shopping on amazon is looking for gnc and those products have very high margins so we are able to leverage that on the store front with amazon joshua siber are you seeing these customers buy on gnccom as well in addition to the shopping on amazon or are they exclusively on amazon tricia k tolivar its too early to tell at this point but well continue to monitor the data joshua siber got it thank you operator and now well go to a question from curtis nagle of bank of america merrill lynch curtis nagle just a quick one on free cash flow i was hoping to clarify the number i think you said  million this year and if thats the case what are the primary drivers it looks like that would imply a pretty significant acceleration tricia k tolivar so the free cash flow i did say  million its the combination of working capital improvements and operating results curtis nagle could you be a little more specific in terms of i guess which buckets within working capital tricia k tolivar so we do have an opportunity to rationalize our inventory levels so our inventory per store amounts are the highest theyve been in years in the first quarter we wanted to be very mindful of our instock so we did accelerate inventory to make sure that we were meeting the demand that we were seeing from the transaction levels but we do see opportunity to segment stores and reallocate inventory into the appropriate places which would result in reductions in average inventory per store and working capital improvement by the end of  curtis nagle understood and then i guess are there any opportunities on accounts payable tricia k tolivar certainly always looking for opportunities on accounts payable and that would be part of discussions with the vendors that are ongoing curtis nagle got it all night thanks very much operator operator instructions we will now go to stephen tanal of goldman sachs stephen tanal i guess just to followup on that last one first other than elevated inventory in q is there anything else that you would sort of describe as sort of unusual with respect to kind of the run rate in cash generation obviously  million and we are talking about  million of deferred gold card fee revenue like is there something else we should be thinking about there that would imply kind of like  million underlying operating figure tricia k tolivar so there isnt anything else underlying so certainly as we sell more pro access memberships those drive cash flows in the back half of the year and improvement in the business itself in addition to the improvement in pro access sales is what drives the improved performance stephen tanal got it and then just advertising at  million per quarter is that a fair run rate or is that a bit elevated given the relaunch where should we think about that going quarterly tricia k tolivar so the advertising and the  million that we referred to was actually an increase in advertising over the prior year and  million of that was related to the launch of the one new gnc the combination of the super bowl investment that we reallocated into other areas and around  million in an investment in online marketing that we mentioned that had a to return so as we look at those results and what that means going forward advertising historically has been around  of sales i would say our spend would be at least that on a go forward basis and as we learn more about online marketing and see those results its possible that that could increase as we proceed through the second third and fourth quarter from an online marketing perspective we heavily invested as i mentioned  million in the first quarter and we are pleased with the results and we have elected to continue that investment in april and well closely monitor and adjust the investment up or down based on the returns as we go into  stephen tanal got it thats helpful and just lastly as we kind of look at the relaunch impact kind of by bucket or stores which was great and helpful to think about and the transactions are obviously great across the board but it seems like the overall comp is pretty different by group of stores and most recent set being the toughest the first set a little softer than the second set what do you make of that how do you think about the ramp and how would you characterize the different outcomes here by group of stores tricia k tolivar so certainly our most recent stores havent had the benefit of more time on the program so the pilots had an additional two to three months at least on the program so their customers are coming more often the transaction list and the pilot locations are five points or more above the rest of the chain and so you can see wheres the momentum that continues to build the other piece is that there is a significant investment in basket so as the stores back to what bob said as the stores continue to demonstrate retail  behavior and we will see that improve so our expectation is the rest of the chain will model itself out with time very similar to what the pilot stores were experiencing certainly training will help that but keep in mind that in february allstore bogo in the prior year had an impact on all of our stores from a comp perspective a basket perspective and a transaction perspective and also keep in mind that there are two sixday bogos allstore bogos in the second quarter that we are anniversarying too so that will have an impact on our results as we move through q stephen tanal got it okay thanks a lot operator well take our next question from sean naughton of piper jaffray sean naughton good morning and thanks for the breakout on the retail sales and the online data its helpful on the comp side but just i guess when looking at that and i take a look at your kind of domestic retail business on a threeyear stacked trend it appears theres very small kind of improvement from q only about  basis points and i would have expected some potentially higher numbers given the marketing campaign and maybe an extra selling day from easter so any explanation there am i looking at these correctly anything i should be thinking about as i think about modelling moving forward tricia k tolivar i would really focus on transaction list so the transaction q transaction increase was  over the prior year those types of transaction lists are something we have not seen in years and years at gnc so understanding that we made an investment in basket but we have training and programs in place to help drive that in the back half so i would focus on the transactions and how thats changed dramatically from the fourth quarter so we were down  in q and up  in q and then the opportunities that we have in basket to drive positive comps in the back half of the year sean naughton okay and then any clarification on whether or not easter shifting out of q into q was a benefit for you guys tricia k tolivar it certainly was some benefit to us and its less than a point but it has an impact sean naughton and then any comment on how that impacted transactions for the month of march so you gave the numbers going from   then to  tricia k tolivar there is some impact but it does not explain the increase that we see from  to  sean naughton okay and then i guess you also provided some interesting details on the  stores that you rolled out in september for a flat comp in the first quarter any commentary on how those  stores performed in q tricia k tolivar so those stores in q had positive transaction growth amounts and declines in basket they hadnt reached a net positive comp yet in q but they were – what were seeing in the rest of the chain is very similar to what we saw in the pilot markets in the fourth quarter of  sean naughton so if i just summarize that so the group  stores improved in comp from q from q tricia k tolivar that is correct sean naughton okay and then just last question on the online segment obviously a very nice improvement from q into q how much of that overall improvement was just driven by the amazon marketplace and then i think somebody else asked about the contribution margin from that business relative to the overall business but is that better than your own gnccom business tricia k tolivar the amazon marketplace business is very new so we launched the site in january and it is contributing to closing the gap in the declines in gnccom but we have also done a number of other things with our gnccom program we have added and expanded assortment so there is  or more skus have been added we invested in the online marketing which both benefits dotcom and the brickandmortar locations and as you mentioned we introduced our marketplace and fba on amazon store prime eligible in february and all of those together are helping us close the gap and give us the belief that in the back half of the year as we mentioned in the call well return to positive comps in the gnccom business regarding margins on amazon i mentioned earlier we have a high penetration of gnc branded sales so that yields quite high margins on our amazon business and this certainly proves to make very good economics despite the toll there is associated with participating on amazon sean naughton okay thanks for taking the questions operator now well take a question from bob summers with macquarie bob summers just to dig a little more into the comp bucket so clearly as a group the pilot stores are comping positive with the second group more productive than the first i guess is it fair to say that you learned something in the first set of stores that made the second better and then second with respect to the remaining stores as you look at the progression how does it compare to that second set is the path similar or is there anything in the dispersion of performance that would give you any concern tricia k tolivar so to start with your last question there is nothing in the performance that were seeing that gives us any concern the rest of the chain that launched in december th is performing similarly to the pilot locations and while there are variances and differences between the two launches september and october we havent identified anything in particular thats causing one to differ from the other while there are differences they are not significantly different and what the rest of the chain needs is just the benefit of more time that those pilot locations have so continued improvement and momentum in the transaction comps and thats expected as we move through  bob summers okay and then you talked about the success of amazon marketplace are there any metrics that you can put around that or maybe frame it as to how you are executing against both what you think are the near and longer term opportunities tricia k tolivar there arent any other specific metrics that well share at this time except to say that we are exceeding our expectations and we are pleased with the opportunities and what it will be able to do for us in the back half of  and beyond operator we have time for one last question and that will come from damian witkowski of gabelli damian witkowski question on the retention or conversion rate the  thats identifiable from the paid gold card to the free gold card and where does that rank in terms of what you were thinking initially i mean that seems pretty low what are you doing to kind of get it to a higher number and what do you think that number ultimately may be tricia k tolivar so the  conversion is tracking where we expected certainly well have the benefit of time to see that improve but what we are very pleased with is the frequency of the people that are coming and in the past they came four times per year our new members are on a path to come six times per year and while we have specifically identified a conversion of  of our existing gold card members there is a possibility that there are my free gnc rewards members that were old gold card members that we have yet to link that data damian witkowski okay and then you mentioned the environment getting more competitive just curious a what do you think is driving that i mean is it that the overall market is slowing and at once trying to grab a bigger share of a shrinking pie or – and more importantly where is it coming from is it coming from the specialty independents or is it coming more from the bigger rivals tricia k tolivar so where we are seeing the more competitiveness is in the specialty area they are really watching our price and reacting in a very promotional way we are not finding that our space in general is becoming tighter so all of our estimates indicate that we have got mid to low single digit growth so  to  growth in the industry as we move forward and in the specialty space its  or more and projected to be that through  damian witkowski and then just lastly can you talk about mall locations versus your other locations on a samestore sales basis just performance how it compares to overall tricia k tolivar so the transaction list we are seeing in the malls and the strips are very similar and the conversion rate in the mall locations is actually higher than in the strip locations so we are seeing good momentum from all our real estate types operator this does conclude todays questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back to ceo bob moran for any additional or closing comments robert f moran i just want to thank you for your time we are very excited in what we have accomplished and actually even more excited for what we think is going to happen in the back half we will continue making investments in our associates especially in our training and in our conversations but looking forward  days from now to look at our q results and be able to talk a little bit more about all the things that are transpiring for the back half of the year thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the gnc holdings inc first quarter  earnings call you may now disconnect thank you for using att teleconference copyright policy

youve had a chance to see the releases we issued earlier announcing our second quarter results as well as our decision to make a leadership change on todays call ill start by giving you a bit of context around the boards decision to make a leadership change and after that i will briefly recap our results for the quarter as well as what i am focused on as we work to deliver improved performance tricia will then take you through the results in more detail and we will be happy to take your questions at the end let me start by saying that gnc is a leader in our industry and i remain confident in the business and our ability to get back on track we clearly have a lot of work to do but we are fortunate to have a talented team in place along with a loyal customer base and we are committed to delivering improved results we need to move with urgency to change the trajectory of the business as we work to enhance our operations and maximize our potential going forward we appreciate mikes contributions over the last couple of years but the board determined change is needed im honored that the board selected me to serve as interim ceo and i assure you i am committed to delivering improved shareholder value having served as a member of the gnc board of directors since  i understand the company and its potential and i have the confidence in our ability to revitalize the business as we work towards that goal we will remain committed to pursuing the comprehensive review of strategic and financial alternatives as we announced earlier this year in my new role i will continue to work closely with the board on that important effort as we continue to focus on driving improvements on how we operate with a clear objective of increasing value for shareholders so let me now shift gears and turn to our results for the second quarter quite simply our results were not acceptable at a high level the  decline in samestore sales reflect softness in our vitamins and food and drink categories and lower traffic particularly in our mall locations in the coming weeks and months i will immerge myself in the details of the business and we will evaluate all aspects of it together with the team here at gnc i will be looking for those critical areas that we need to address in order to meaningfully impact the business in the shortest period of time we will conduct a frank and honest assessment of the business whats working and whats not and we will move quickly and deliberately to make the changes and adjustments to alter the trajectory of the business and drive better more consistent results at the core our efforts will be centered around delivering for our customers and driving traffic across the companyowned stores franchises and online there are no magic bullets or overnight solutions but based on my experience in turning around other retail operations and my knowledge of gnc i am confident we can and will deliver improved performance when we convene again to discuss our thirdquarter results ill look forward to providing you with insights based on my assessment of the business as well as an initial overview of the actions we intend to take we are cleared eyed about the fact that changing the trajectory of the business will not happen overnight but we are committed to moving with urgency that said we also need to take appropriate actions that will enable us to meet our objectives as we conduct this evaluation and develop an appropriate action plan to improve our results we believe that it is prudent to temporarily suspend our guidance for  this decision in no way diminishes our commitment to moving quickly to enhance performance nor does it reflect the lack of confidence in our longterm prospects i simply want to take time to assess the situation before i commit the guidance let me wrap up by saying that the board and i believe in gnc its financial strength and most of all its people i look forward to engaging with all of you as well as the entire gnc community as we work to revitalize the business continue our review of strategic and financial alternatives and above all deliver value to our customers franchisees suppliers employees and most importantly our shareholders with that ill turn it over to tricia tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you bob and good morning everyone before addressing this quarters results i want to briefly remind you about updates we have made to our reporting segments in order to better align our financial reporting structure with how we view our business beginning in the second quarter weve changed our reportable operating segments from retail franchise and manufacturingwholesale to us  canada international and manufacturingwholesale as part of this change we allocated warehousing and distribution costs as appropriate to our reportable segments in our second quarter  form q that will be filed later today we provide you the first quarter as well as the previous two years by quarter of reported amounts recast into the new segments as we discussed last quarter the new reportable segments better align with our new organizational structure and how we analyze our performance and allocate resources we believe that these segments along with supplemental metrics will provide better transparency into our business and progress on our refranchising initiatives as we increase the proportion of domestic stores at our franchise locations throughout  and beyond now to the consolidated results our second quarter consolidated revenue decreased  to  million compared to the prior year quarter revenue decreased by  in our us  canada segment and  in our international segment revenue in our manufacturingwholesale segment excluding intersegment sales increased  in addition the fourth quarter sale of our discount supplements business resulted in a decrease of  million of revenue in second quarter of  as bob noted at the outset second quarter samestore sales decreased  in domestic companyowned stores including gnccom sales softness in our food business in vitapaks had more than a  negative impact on our yearoveryear comparisons and we will not cycle in this softness until early  while we had negative comparisons across all real estate types continued declines in mall traffic which while not unique to gnc had a negative impact on yearoveryear comparisons and worsened over the course of the quarter and into july a significant percent of our sales happen in our mall locations while  of our overall companyowned store base are in malls those stores account for  of sales as they tend to generate higher revenue compared to our strip centers samestore sales at our strip center locations were down  for the quarter and while our vitamin and vitapak categories saw sequential improvements in the quarter there is still work to do as their negative impact weighs on our overall revenue we were pleased to see continued strength in our performance supplements and our health and beauty categories in domestic franchise locations samestore sales decreased  in the second quarter of  our franchisees are not fully participating in all corporate permissions  and have not fully adopted our expanded assortment initiative which drove a  improvement in comps in companyowned stores that received the assortment in  our analysis shows that franchisees that have adopted both the expanded assortment and allstore bogo strategies see a significant increase in both our samestore sales as well as margins compared to those that do not participate as we indicated last quarter this analysis was a central feature at our recent annual franchise convention early indications post convention are that we are seeing additional adoption of these initiatives and clearly we will work to continue to work closely with all of our franchisees in this area domestic systemwide sales as previously defined were  million in the current quarter as compared with  million in the prior year quarter second quarter gross profit rate decreased  and was  of revenue gross profit is calculated after deducting product warehousing distribution and occupancy costs the second quarter  decrease in gross profit dollars and gross profit rate was a result of lower sales lower product margins in our gnccom business and deleverage of occupancy costs as a result of the negative samestore sales more than onethird of the gross profit rate decline can be attributed to deleverage looking at domestic retail product margin in the quarter we saw a sequential improvement of  basis points due largely to less sales of expiring product and a subsequent improvement in sales mix on a yearoveryear basis domestic retail product margin rate declined  basis points second quarter  consolidated sga expenses decreased  million to  million or  of revenue compared with  of revenue for the same period last year largely driven by a reduction in incentive accruals second quarter  operating income was  million or  of revenue as compared with  in the second quarter of  excluding  million in gains on refranchising operating income was  million or  of revenue as weve mentioned in the past its important to note that operating income margin is negatively impacted when domestic retail samestore sales are below  reported earnings per share were  compared with  in the prior year quarter but again excluding the gain from franchise conversions and certain prior period expenses adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of  were  compared to adjusted eps of  in the prior year now for information by segment first to our us  canada segment revenue which includes all domestic companyowned and franchise stores ecommerce and canada decreased  million or  to  million in second quarter  compared with  million in the prior year quarter primarily due to negative domestic retail samestore sales of  and negative franchise samestore sales of  weakness in the food and protein categories as well as continued softness in vitamins and vitapaks coupled with softer than expected traffic trends negatively impacted the quarter our strip center location comps continued to outperform all locations and were basically flat for the quarter domestic franchise revenue decreased  million to  million in the current quarter due to lower wholesale sales and royalties as an overall decline more than offset the earlier timing of our annual franchise convention which resulted in  million of higher sales in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter operating income decreased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million for the same period in  operating income as a percentage of segment revenue was  in the current quarter compared with  in the prior year quarter excluding refranchising gains of  million and  million operating income was  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million in the prior year period or  of sales versus  of sales respectively as expected during the second quarter we saw significant sequential improvement of  basis points in retail product margin rate as the levels of expiring product normalized additionally despite the inclusion of two allstore bogos in the quarter and none in the prior year domestic retail product margin rate was only  basis points below the prioryear quarter the remaining decline in operating margins in this segment was attributed to expense deleverage of fixed cost and lower product margin rate in our gnccom business second to our international segment revenues in our international segment decreased  to  million in the current quarter compared with  million in the prioryear quarter the decline was primarily due to challenges in mexico chile and turkey the currency devaluation in mexico adversely impacted consumer demand so we are actively working with our vendors and franchisees to making sure we have more differentiated and exclusive products for our marketplace turkey has been challenging for us in the market for several periods we have identified a new partner in the market and are working diligently to get this market back on track we continue to believe that international markets hold a tremendous potential for gnc and are working to ensure that we are able to capitalize on the opportunities operating income decreased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million in the prior year quarter operating income was  of segment revenue in the current quarter compared with  in the prior year quarter the decrease in operating income percentage was primarily due to a bad debt allowance associated with a franchisee recorded in the current quarter along with a comparative effect of the reversal of a previously established bad debt allowance with a franchisee in the prior year quarter also foreign currency translation had a negative  million impact in the quarter third to our manufacturing and wholesale segment revenues in our manufacturing and wholesale segment excluding intersegment sales increased by  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million in the prior year quarter operating income decreased  to  million for the second quarter of  compared with  million in the prior year quarter the decrease in operating income was due to lesser sales of gnc branded products in the quarter next to our balance sheet and cash flow thus far in  we have generated  million in net cash from operating activities which has been negatively impacted by the lesser than anticipated net income and higher inventory levels built as a result of prior expectations of higher sales inventory levels in the period were higher in the quarter around several key and planned events the transition to a new analytic systems more accurately manage store replenishment which is driving better instock levels new product launches and the implementation of expanded assortment and additional stores yeartodate we have invested  million in capital expenditures primarily for strategic initiatives it infrastructure store development as well as maintenance yeartodate

second quarter with availability of  million on our revolving credit facility while we have increased our revolver borrowings and capacity we remain committed to managing our leverage to maintain our existing credit rating that completes the financial update and at this point wed like to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and we will take our first question from chris horvers with jpmorgan tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey chris christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning hey bob how are you doing robert f moran  interim ceo pretty good chris how are you doing christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc doing good couple of questions and obviously tough questions given whats gone on here so first question is theres a line in the release that suggests execution is a problem and not for say the strategy is that what were supposed to interpret here or are all the options on the table from promotional strategy to the ultimate percentage of stores that might go franchise and the latter mike had targeted about  over time tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think its a combination of things clearly we are working with bob to create an effective strategy that will over time enable us to reverse our recent trends and change the trajectory of the business so during that evaluation we will be looking at all aspects of it and making appropriate changes to do just that certainly as part of our strategic assessment that is still ongoing were looking at all options including franchising as well as other options that face us right now christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc understood and so thats a good segue so i want to get inside the boards head on the ceo change in the past two years it appears the board has pushed out two ceos joe was here over  years and mike has only been here two years at the same time you have a strategic review ongoing are you starting an external search immediately how do you think about the companys ability to attract talent as affected by the events of the past two years and the ongoing review are you bob a potential fulltime candidate or should we look at this as the company is really committed to really an ownership change here given from my perspective its going to be tough getting someone new in with the ongoing strategic review and the events of the past two years robert f moran  interim ceo hey chris i think its too premature to actually address that issue right now our focus is really working on the critical items that will reverse the trends and the financial performance the way im looking at it is we have to have a healthy disrespect for the status quo because the status quo is yielding  negative comps and we have to reverse those trends we need more footsteps we need more transactions and well go circle the wagons to look at everything that were doing to enhance the customer experience but also customer traffic so i think its too early in the game right now to talk about that and i think you know me chris i will do whatever it takes so christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc so would you consider taking this job as a fulltime role robert f moran  interim ceo i think its too premature to even address that right now christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks very much operator our next participant is sean kras at barclays sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc good morning thanks for taking my questions so bob you obviously have experienced achieving success in a highly competitive industry at petsmart is there any color you can give strategically and have some of the changes you used there could be used at gnc to turn things around robert f moran  interim ceo well i think the key is – and in today retailing you have to have a unique proposition that you can market and be not a same old type of proposition so i think if you look at the gnc brand the uniqueness of products the customer experience the innovation and i think we have an opportunity to really get the value message out i think theres a number of things that we can address i think theres also things within the store experience that we can enhance to kind of evolve and become a true specialty store and be a trusted advisor in our business so i think theres a number of things that could be applicable but at the same time you know retailing is retailing its about giving the customer what theyre looking for and if you do that in a unique way you can really build a very effective communication and marketing plan around it so the key is more customers more transactions more footsteps in the door sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc yeah thanks for that and my followup is another company recently discussed the study that showed that to capture about a quarter of the most loyal customers and if the remaining spend of them was going really to mass and online so it seemed like there was an opportunity but at the time its also a sort of data point that suggests that the customers may be somewhat of a cherry picker so i guess based on that i guess one do you agree with this assessment and secondly what can you do about it robert f moran  interim ceo theres no question that if we actually look at the industry and especially over the last couple of years almost everyone be it mass supermarket the drugstores have expanded their presentation of our product so again going back to uniqueness what can we offer and i think we have a tremendous foundation of not only of our people but our brand our unique products our knowledge of the industry that i think we can build a unique proposition that others cannot do and i mean if i can go back to my petsmart days being a trusted advisor for something thats critical to lifestyles be it pets or be it vitamins or supplements having a conversation is critically important you cant do that in a drugstore you cant do that in a supermarket you cant do that mass and when you get – become a trusted advisor you start really building a foundation that you can become very unique in that world so as i say were going to have a healthy disrespect for the status quo and were going to challenge everything we do to see what we need to do to satisfy the customers wants and needs sean stephen kras  barclays capital inc got it i will get back in queue thanks operator we will now hear from simeon gutman with morgan stanley tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning simeon simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning hey a question for bob i think you know the idea of driving transactions and traffic in the store thats been a focus at least in prior management and prior management before that and theres been an argument that gnc has been too dependent on promotions in the past and you know i think from the strategy that we understood mike tried to adjust that and a lot of the points of that strategy seemed reasonable but very difficult given a business that again was very used to being put on promotion on and off and so just curious from your experience i wanted – did the board disagree with this promotional approach at all in this regime or in the previous one and then how fixable is it and did you ever consider moving towards a lower pricing structure so that you can reduce the dependency on some of these promotions robert f moran  interim ceo well with  minutes under my belt of experience inside the ceo role as i say if i go back to the board the board dissatisfaction was with the overall financial performance and again demonstrating negative comps over course of a couple quarters is not the direction we want to be in so nothing sacred well be looking at our promotional activity well be looking at the gold card were going to look at ways that we can communicate with the customer and what we need is new customers and we need to have more share of wallet of our loyal customers and theres going to be a total focus on that so i cant address the promotional strategy at this point in time because i dont think that by itself is – was the issue it was more the overall trends trajectory of the business and we need to reverse those trends and thats why were here to sort of challenge everything so yes that will be challenged and well be looking at that but you just – i mean unfortunately bogo has become like crack cocaine you have to – you really have to address that build a value proposition for the customer and i dont think you do that totally through bogos monthin monthout tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president and theres no magic bullet robert f moran  interim ceo yeah exactly tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president the board has confidence in our business the strength of the brand and the franchise model as well as the longterm prospects for gnc simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc and the financial guidance was suspended but the press release indicates that youre on track with your refranchising goals so we take that to interpret that that the board is committed to that strategy is that a reasonable assumption robert f moran  interim ceo that is correct simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc and just to sneak one last one and tricia because i dont – i didnt see a streaming transcript i didnt know if i heard it right but did you say the nonstrip stores or the strip stores were doing negative  tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president i did simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then the comment in the press release where you talked about traffic unexpected decline was that implying that there was positive traffic or just less negative traffic for the overall business during the quarter and then it just fell off at the end tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we saw sequential declines in traffic during the quarter and they continued into july simeon ari gutman  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks operator our next question comes from stephen tanal with goldman sachs stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co good morning guys thanks for taking the questions tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co i guess for starters as we sort of think about the domestic franchisee performance you know the comp number obviously is quite a bit softer than companyowned and it seems like there are some good reasons for that but how is that translating into the refranchising strategy as you have those conversations with maybe existing franchisees and potentially new ones as well what are you seeing there tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president so when you look at our refranchising strategy its largely around our strip center locations so while were seeing some declines in traffic were certainly not experiencing the negative samestore sales trends that our franchisees are and thats largely due to the delayed adoption of our initiative of expanded assortment and the all store bogo so were still experiencing interest we closed our transaction with a significant  stores in the second quarter and we have over  stores under negotiation currently stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co thats good to hear now on the mall stores forgive me if i missed it but have you guys at this point come to a decision visàvis maybe closing some of those as the leases come due or how are you thinking about those locations tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president ill first start with our mall stores more than  of them are achieving results above our cost of capital so theyre generating very strong returns but were seeing declining trends there so were being very mindful of expiring leases the opportunity to negotiate renegotiate rents shorten the lease terms and be prudent and thoughtful on how we expand or continue in those locations but were not – from an overall mall perspective were getting good results and evaluating this is just part of our normal course of business stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co got it and if i could just ask a bigger picture one as youre looking at the comps and maybe its not the promotional strategy i think bob has said as much and weve been tracking that and it looks like youve been promotional – what would you say is the approximate cause of these comp decline and if its increased competition is it mass channel and how do you think about you know that – what that means for the forward strategy is there potentially a discussion about bringing the gnc brand to mass in a bigger way potentially or how are you guys thinking about all of that tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so as bob mentioned earlier we are seeing shifts to mass and online vitamins tend to be commoditized and we are seeing increasing sku offerings outside of gnc and so what were focused on is differentiating that experience as bob mentioned so creating exclusive product in our stores a differentiated customer experience and getting that traffic back into and across the lead signs  into gnc so everything is under evaluation as bob said and well do what we can to quickly change the trajectory of our results and reverse the current trends stephen tanal  goldman sachs  co all right thank you very much operator we will now hear from shane higgins with deutsche bank shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc yeah good morning and thanks for taking the questions just wanted to ask some questions on gnccom i know traffic was down quite a bit in the first quarter did you guys see any sequential improvement there and what steps are you taking to drive that business tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we are continuing to see traffic declines on gnccom that gnccom evaluation is part of this ongoing process but keep in mind we view gnc as the closest instantiation of the customer experience for us in the stores so we certainly dont want to use gnccom to compete with amazon were not on the same parity from a results expectation and competing on price like that is certainly a race to the bottom so we have to be certain that gnccom is supporting our store activities for both our companyowned and our franchise locations and that will be a center of focus for us as well shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay did you see any significant – i mean well first of all what was the impact on the comp for the quarter tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we havent disclosed and we historically dont disclose the impact on comp but it was negative shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay and did you see anything that changed really sequentially i mean obviously competition is pretty intense and you dont want to race to the bottom but at the same time the business has been shrinking i believe faster you know what steps are you taking there to change in marketing or maybe reach out toward – to your gold card members to kind of get some traction in that business tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president so there is – so our gnccom business is fairly diverse so theres impacts from international bulk purchases as well as the bc customers its not all domestic and so the international influence is playing a role as well and we just need to be thoughtful about that strategy going forward shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and just one last question on the corporate expenses they were down about  yearoveryear is there – just color as to what led to the improvement i know you mentioned incentive comp was there anything else in there tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president its largely incentive comp reversals shane higgins  deutsche bank securities inc got it all right thanks operator our next participant is mark wiltamuth with jefferies mark gregory wiltamuth  jefferies llc hi thank you i wonder if you can give us some feedback on what the franchisees were saying coming out of convention like what are their primary concerns because clearly they are not adopting all of your programs like why are they holding back and then also want a little more color on the vitapaks i mean this has been a flagship product in the past are you just not providing it enough promotional support or is there a lack of product innovation there what do you think is going on in the vitapaks tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president ill start with your first question around the franchise convention while were not fully adopt – while franchisees have not fully adopted our initiatives more than  of them have now included expanded assortment in their offerings and a lot of that took place during the franchise convention which was at the end of june so it takes some time to get the product to the stores and see the results and the lift and once we do have the product the lifts are quite immediate so were optimistic about that impact going forward it is a significant capital investment and when there are declines in traffic that makes it challenging to come up with capital for a large number of our franchisees so focusing on traffic trends and changing that trajectory will help adoption in those areas we continue to offer incentives extended dating as well as reminding franchisees that there is the opportunity to return the product after a year so that if the product doesnt sell and so well – again well work with our franchisees that are critical to us and make sure that we can create a compelling argument for them but clearly driving traffic is a major focus with vitapaks we certainly see and youre right vitapaks are a great asset for us they are very convenient costeffective and fairly unique in the marketplace so when we focus on vitapaks we are seeing lifts there is just a lot of skus i mean we need to make sure that were making the choices simple for our customers certainly dont think that were over inventoried but we want to make the decisionmaking process a little bit easier so well continue to reinforce in the field training communication marketing activities to highlight the advantages of vitapaks to continue to change that trajectory and turn it into a positive result instead of a negative mark gregory wiltamuth  jefferies llc so it sounds like you may have too many skus there is that that what were hearing there tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president like i said we dont feel like were over inventoried just lots of choices and we want to streamline that a little bit mark gregory wiltamuth  jefferies llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from peter benedict with robert baird peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc broker hey guys thanks for taking the question and bob nice to hear your voice again robert f moran  interim ceo thanks peter peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess my first question just around – how did the economics of selling  stores to one franchisee differ from selling  store to  stores if at all tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president theres not a significant difference between selling  stores versus one store or two stores and certainly in selling with that one entity with  locations it creates an opportunity for us to make – create more efficient systems and benefits that not only will the new franchisee benefit from but other franchisees will as well for example im creating more efficient inventory ordering systems and other opportunities so well just continue to get better and better in the franchise business because its critical that we serve our franchisees because they are a critical component to our future success and strategy and well continue to make those enhancements peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks and then just back to the pricing environment and some of the strategies you guys have been looking at and im curious if you – i think you guys are testing in three markets some new pricing dynamics can you give us an update on how thats going is that something thats going to continue or are you guys changing course on that tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president no were not changing course pete so we are continuing the test so pricing as weve talked about is a very sensitive subject and certainly one that we dont want to quickly make rash decisions that could have a significant negative impact so our customers on average come four times a year weve implemented kvi pricing in a handful of markets and weve expanded that now to see and test where we have the opportunity to do what we call harvest pricing so theres some items where were underpriced and we think the balance of the two will create the optimal pricing mix to bring more traffic into the stores more often and have margin neutral impact so those tests are still underway and it will take a number of months to read the results appropriately before we launch likely in  peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great and then just last one just around the loyal customer base can you give us a little update on just your gold card initiatives that youve got underway right now what are you seeing how many card holders you guys have just kind of what trends are you seeing at this – with the spending within that group of customers as opposed to the nongold card members thank you tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president so we currently have  million gold card customers were finding that our loyal gold card customers are coming more often and spending more which is a good thing so our direct marketing campaigns are working effectively with our existing customer base we do have in test a number of different loyalty programs as you know weve talked about our gold card is likely a pay to play program and what we see an opportunity to do is enhance it to create a loyalty program to attract new customer as well as expand the share of wallet with our existing customers those tests have just started so its too early to read or share any information and again going back to traffic trends or customer behavior we want to read it over time so thats likely a  launch as well peter s benedict  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks so much guys operator we will now hear from joe edelstein with stephens inc tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president morning joe john brick  stephens inc hey its actually john on for joe good morning tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey john john brick  stephens inc most of our questions have been touched on but i would like to come back to the corporate costs here if you guys do have longterm franchising goal where do you see this corporate cost structure coming in at so were like  million fiscal  does that number look more like a  million or even lower given that most of the franchises will take the cost on tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we actually are not forecasting a change in our overall sga as we shift to a more franchise operation but we still think its important to provide support in the field for the franchisees and its our commitment to restructure our field personnel but not reduce the overall cost so none of our models or expectations are anticipating a significant change in sga as a result john brick  stephens inc okay and then i guess to the operating margin line then where do you guys forecast that going to so weve been running at   in the us and canada segment here do you think that number can get up in the s  or maybe even to this international revenues line of about  tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we typically dont share information going forward on what we expect what i can tell you is with negative samestore sale there is significant deleverage so that will have pressure on operating margins if the trajectory doesnt change so i believe we mentioned on the call comps of  we see leverage so be thoughtful of that as we model going forward with expectations john brick  stephens inc yes okay and then lastly just can you give us any color on how international is doing it seems to be performing well highmargins but any growth rate expectations or just anything you can give us would be helpful thanks tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure so as we said on the call we still believe there are opportunities in international were continuing to invest there being very thoughtful about the countries in which we enter and the partners with which we do business with so that were achieving growth and opportunities in the right places so were not dealing with franchisees that are not stable and able to sustain so more opportunities to come and as we can well share more details going forward john brick  stephens inc thank you operator our next question comes from phil terpolilli with wedbush securities philip terpolilli  wedbush securities inc yes good morning tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning philip terpolilli  wedbush securities inc thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask bigger picture in addition to the international opportunities you mentioned i think when we look back at gnc extended the brand into other retailers whether thats rite aid petsmart et cetera and seems to have not been as big of a focus the last couple years but is that an opportunity that you see tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president as we said were currently evaluating all options and well be focused on reversing trends and doing what we can in critical areas to change the trajectory in the nearterm not saying there arent opportunities there but certainly theres an opportunity to focus on traffic in the business and move forward keep in mind that our agreement with rite aid today prohibits us from expanding with other competitors so there are some restrictions in our contracts that would prevent us from expanding significantly in certain areas philip terpolilli  wedbush securities inc okay thats helpful and then one more follow up if i could where do we stand right now on improving assortment its something weve been talking about for a bit and i apologize if i missed this earlier is the sales lift you experienced this quarter from assortment was it similar to what weve seen the last couple quarters tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president it is and we didnt share it its actually better than its been so the investments were making in the exclusive products and the new inventory we are seeing positive results from that and that i expect will be part of our strategy going forward to help differentiate us from mass and others in the marketplace philip terpolilli  wedbush securities inc okay perfect thank you operator our next participant is tim cusack with raymond james financial tim cusack  raymond james financial services inc this question is directed to bob moran can you shed any light at all on your ongoing strategic review and particularly with respect to its timetable and whether the bloomberg reports citing several asian buyers are accurate robert f moran  interim ceo i think right now the two missions that im focusing on one is continuing of a strategic and financial alternative review and were not at a point that we can even comment on where we are at this point in time other than saying that thats one of my focuses the other one is obviously changing the trajectory of the financial performance and i think they go handinhand so more to come and as i said earlier as i get towards the third quarter i want to give you initial assessments of whats going on in all areas of the business tim cusack  raymond james financial services inc thank you operator our next question comes from sean naughton with piper jaffray sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker hi good morning tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker just in terms of the sector and the overall industry trends its been pretty challenging for most participants and just given the fact that its often driven by innovation or some newness in product is there anything that could get the customer excited again at this point in time that youre beginning to see in some of the sales trends data that would get people coming back into specialty versus going to the lowest common denominator in terms of price for these products tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes and we talked earlier the new items that we added are bringing in new customers and driving results we certainly see there is an opportunity there the dr oz days are behind us but were thoughtful in our evaluation of innovation and new products and bringing in the right thirdparty vendors where appropriate with longerterm exclusivities to create that differentiation but its really about the experience in the store creating an environment thats exciting for customers whether thats around sampling or community activities and really differentiating us from the service that you cant get in mass online or even in the grocery stores sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker okay thats helpful and then you talked about some impact from comps in the first quarter around expired vitamins i just wasnt clear whether or not any of that had leaked over into q i understand there was obviously a traffic problem in q more than anything else but was there any impact from expiration of vitamins that happened in q tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we are seeing our expiring products back to normalized levels and as i mentioned on the call we saw sequential improvement in product margin rate as a result of less discounting on clearance and expiring product in the second quarter sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker so less of an impact than you saw in q tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president correct sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then just a clarification did you say earlier that the mall stores are about  of your sales and the strips are closer to  is that the right way to think about the retail mix for you guys at gnc tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president so mall stores are around  but only  of the store mix so yes  of revenue and then strips are in the range that you mentioned but keep in mind we also have downtown locations and military locations as well sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then just lastly on the split between private label and national brands any difference in the sales trends there that youre seeing between private label or exclusively branded products that you have in the store tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president we have continued to add third party so theres been an increase in mix of thirdparty products not majorly significant but theres certainly an increase in mix as we add those items sean p naughton  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you operator we will now hear from damian witkowski with gabelli damian andrew witkowski  gresearch llc hi can i just circle back to the mall locations and based on the comments you made it sounds to me like mall locations are actually running negative comps around high singledigits   even and im wondering if thats the trend and is this an unusually bad quarter for the mall locations or has that been the trend over the last few quarters and also is it just that your – obviously mall traffic has not been growing but are you in the wrong malls if you are in a right mall are you in a wrong location in the mall how much can you do to actually improve that performance other than to close down locations that dont work as the leases expire tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president couple things yes malls are performing negatively and the number you indicated is slightly higher than what were actually seeing in our mall locations again going back to the mix of stores in the whole portfolio however were seeing – its not that malls in the second quarter had a disproportionate change in their traffic trends they were down but very consistent with what mall traffic is experiencing in general so while malls are down the downward trend is consistent with the mall traffic in general to your point about mall strategy and how we look at this going forward we do see opportunities in malls to create excitement for customers introducing new grabandgo items and other food items move the product in the stores create a different experience in the mall locations but well be opportunistic as part of our regular process and reviewing mall locations as their leases expire and well make the appropriate decision to drive the highest returns for our shareholders damian andrew witkowski  gresearch llc okay thanks operator our next question comes from curtis nagle with bank of america merrill lynch curtis s nagle  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks very much for taking the question apologies if its something youve already covered but i guess in light of fullyear guidance being suspended anything you can say in terms of buyback activity for the rest of the year tricia k tolivar  chief financial officer  executive vice president our buyback activity is not expected to continue to for the rest of  so we achieved our fullyear goals in the first quarter and slightly into the second quarter we dont expect any repurchases for the remainder of  curtis s nagle  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks very much operator and that concludes todays questionandanswer session robert f moran  interim ceo well i just wanted to thank everybody being on the call obviously big changes today looking forward to the next three months so that i can immerge myself on the details and get back to you in the third quarter so that we can have a honest preliminary assessment of whats going on and what we can do about it so thank you see you in  days operator that concludes todays conference thank you for your participation you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the copyright
