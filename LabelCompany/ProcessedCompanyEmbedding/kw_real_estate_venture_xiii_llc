selectively invest in opportunities across many real estate product types with a goal of maximizing cash flow and return on capital        actively manage assets and finance them conservatively to generate stable predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients we are able to create value for our shareholders in the following ways        we have the ability to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships particularly with financial institutions this can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities        our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we can increase the value of assets and cash flows such as in the case of distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity undermanaged or underleased assets or other repositioning opportunities        many times these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales thereby offering opportunities to achieve above average total returns in many cases we have the opportunity to earn significant additional returns such as through a promoted interest based on the performance of the assets        kw services plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and realtime data for evaluating investments generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies        we understand that real estate is cyclical our management team employs a multicyclical approach that has resulted in our aum being globally diversified across many sectors of real estate while maintaining a healthy liquidity position and adequate access to capital our competitive strengths we believe the combination of a service business and an investment platform provides us with significant competitive advantages and allows us to generate superior riskadjusted returns we use our service platform to facilitate the origination of investment opportunities enhance the investment process and ensure the alignment of interests with our investors interests our competitive advantages include     

committee and our acquisition team have transacted deals in nearly every major metropolitan market on the west coast of the united states as well as in the united kingdom ireland and japan their local presence and reputation in these markets have enabled them to cultivate key relationships with major holders of property inventory particularly financial institutions throughout the real estate

or losses on the extinguishment of mortgage debt as we are in the business of purchasing discounted notes secured by real estate and in connection with these note purchases we may resolve these loans through discounted payoffs with the borrowers ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity additionally ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements our presentation of ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap ebitda is not calculated under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income cash flows or other financial data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our overall profitability or liquidity our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance additionally we believe ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations     s table of contents  adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as defined above adjusted to exclude corporate merger and acquisition related expenses and share based compensation expense for the company our management uses adjusted ebitda to analyze our business because it adjusts ebitda for items that are non cash or that we believe do not have an accurate reflection of the nature of our business going forward such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance additionally we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations however ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda and adjusted ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings as defined by fixed charges for this purpose earnings consists of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and our equity in income of joint ventures plus fixed charges and operating distributions from equity investees and fixed charges consists of interest expense whether capitalized or expensed

consider the additional risk factors below risks related to the notes the notes are expected to be rated below investment grade although the notes have not been rated yet we have sought to obtain a rating for the notes we currently expect the rating of the notes if obtained to be below investment grade which could adversely impact the market price of the notes securities rated below investment grade are generally subject to a higher risk of payment default and price volatility than similar higherrated securities furthermore increases in leverage or deteriorating outlooks for an issuer or volatile markets could lead to continued significant deterioration in market prices of securities rated below investment grade ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency furthermore a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold any particular security including the notes in addition ratings do not reflect market prices or the suitability of a security for a particular investor and any rating of the notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business or the structure or market value of the notes an explanation of the significance of ratings may be obtained from the applicable rating agency a credit rating may not be issued and may not remain in effect for any given period of time and the applicable rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely any rating that it has issued if in that rating agencys judgment the circumstances so warrant it is also possible that any rating assigned to the notes may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events such as future acquisitions holders of the notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of the issuance of a lowerthanexpected rating or a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such a rating any lowerthanexpected rating and any lowering suspension or withdrawal of an issued rating may adversely affect the market price or marketability of the notes   s table of contents our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes as of december   on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale of  million in aggregate principal amount of the notes after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by us kennedywilson and its subsidiaries that are guarantors would have had  million of outstanding indebtedness excluding debt premium and discount of which  million is secured nonrecourse mortgage indebtedness and  million is unsecured senior indebtedness consisting of the notes we are offering  of the  notes and  million of  notes and  million of indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes the  notes and the  notes in addition as of such date we and the subsidiary guarantors had  million aggregate principal amount of guarantees that we and our subsidiary guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by consolidated assets and assets held in various joint ventures that have recourse to us our nonguarantor subsidiaries had  million of secured nonrecourse mortgage indebtedness excluding debt discount as of december   and the notes we hereby are offering are structurally subordinated to such indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you including        it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital capital expenditures and debt service requirements        it may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business        we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage        it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy        the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness including the notes        a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes and        our business and financial condition would materially and adversely suffer if we were unable to service our indebtedness including the notes or obtain additional financing as needed in addition the indenture governing the notes will contain and the indentures governing the  notes the  notes and the  debentures and our unsecured revolving credit facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interest our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt despite our substantial indebtedness we may still incur significantly more debt which could exacerbate the risks described above the indenture governing the notes will permit and the indentures governing the  notes and the  notes and our unsecured revolving credit facility permit us and our subsidiaries to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future as of march   we had  million of outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility as well as  million of accrued and unpaid interest we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering of notes to repay the outstanding balance under this credit facility consequently immediately after this offering and such repayment we expect to have no outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility and  million available for additional borrowing under that facility subject to certain conditions   s table of contents we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a fundamental change offer upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the notes the  notes and the  notes which includes a change of control event or delisting of our common stock we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the notes the  notes and the  notes we may have insufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the notes the  notes or the  notes upon a fundamental change in addition our unsecured revolving credit facility provides that the occurrence of a change of control constitutes a default our failure to purchase tendered notes  notes and  notes would constitute a default under the relevant indenture governing the same which in turn would constitute a default under our credit facility see description of the notesfundamental change in the event of a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock our series a and series b preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the stockholders thereof under the indentures governing the notes the  notes and the  notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in those indentures which includes a change of control event or a delisting of our common stock each noteholder will have the right to require us to purchase that noteholders notes  notes or  notes at a purchase price equal to  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date the occurrence of a fundamental change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders of our series a and series b preferred stock under the applicable certificate of designation under the terms of these indentures kennedywilson may not make any restricted payment to facilitate a redemption of the series a and series b preferred stock unless kennedywilson has restricted payment capacity or has previously made an offer to noteholders to purchase their notes if the noteholders however fail for any reason to tender all of their notes under the offer to purchase them and our preferred stockholders accept the offer to purchase the series a and series b preferred stock we will be required to use cash to fund the purchase of our series a and series b preferred stock in the event this occurs it may be more difficult for us to make scheduled payments on the untendered notes see description of the notesfundamental change in addition we may not redeem the series a and series b preferred stock without the consent of the lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility our failure to purchase the series a and b preferred stock when required could give the holders of that stock a legal claim against us a subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under us bankruptcy or similar state law which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims under us bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a subsidiary guarantee can be voided or claims under the subsidiary guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor if among other things the subsidiary guarantor at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee or in some states when payments become due under the subsidiary guarantee received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the subsidiary guarantee and        was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence        was engaged in a business or transaction for which the subsidiary guarantors remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or        intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature a subsidiary guarantee may also be voided without regard to the above factors if a court finds that the subsidiary guarantor entered into the subsidiary guarantee with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors   s table of contents a court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its subsidiary guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes if a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee you would no longer have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor the measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending on the governing law generally a subsidiary guarantor would be considered insolvent if        the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets        the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they became absolute and mature or        it could not pay its debts as they became due each subsidiary guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of its obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law the notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries the notes will not be guaranteed by a number of our subsidiaries to the extent that any of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the notes the notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations including indebtedness of those nonguarantor subsidiaries the claims of creditors of the nonguarantor subsidiaries including trade creditors will have priority as to the assets of those subsidiaries as a result if we default on our obligations under the notes you will not have any claims against any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes for the years ended december   and  the revenues of our nonguarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately  and  respectively of kennedywilson holding incs consolidated revenues and the operating income of our nonguarantor subsidiaries for these periods was approximately  million and  million respectively as of december   the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately  of kennedywilson holdings consolidated total assets and those subsidiaries had  million of secured nonrecourse mortgage indebtedness excluding debt discount of which none has recourse to us however these figures are as of december   and do not reflect transactions that we have entered into after that date including the kwe transaction or future transactions that we may enter into depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into those subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the indenture governing the notes to guarantee the notes accordingly these figures may fluctuate from time to time and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods for example the instruments governing our acquisitions such as the relevant loan agreement or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower or any related joint venture agreement or the terms of any relevant coinvestment vehicle or separate account or investment program may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the notes in many such cases the indenture does not require our subsidiaries including those described above to guarantee the notes in addition the indenture does not require subject to limitation certain nonmaterial and nonwholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the notes   s table of contents we may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures that may be needed to make payment on the notes although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our subsidiaries and joint ventures are not obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the notes accordingly our ability to make payments on the notes depends on the earnings of and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries and joint ventures furthermore our subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of the indentures governing the notes the  notes and the  notes our unsecured revolving credit facility and the instruments governing other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions the payment of dividends or the making of loans by those subsidiaries to us the agreements governing the future indebtedness of our subsidiaries may not permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the notes when due see description of other indebtedness to service our indebtedness including the notes we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the notes and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control however our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations current capital spending projects may require significant additional funds to complete or be successful and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness including the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we consummate an acquisition our debt service requirements could increase we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness including the notes on or before maturity we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our unsecured revolving credit facility the notes the  notes and the  notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all an active trading market for the notes may not develop prior to this offering there was no public market for the notes we have been informed by certain of the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed however the underwriters may cease their marketmaking activities at any time in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the financial performance or prospects of companies in our industry generally as a result an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes if an active market does not develop or is not maintained the market price of the notes may decline and the liquidity of the notes may be limited our debt agreements will contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business the indenture governing the notes will contain the indentures governing the  notes and the  notes and the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit kennedywilsons and its restricted subsidiaries ability to among other things        incur or guarantee additional indebtedness        pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock   s table of contents      make investments        create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us        sell the stock of our subsidiaries        transfer or sell assets        create liens        enter into saleleaseback transactions        enter into transactions with affiliates and        enter into mergers or consolidations additionally the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing the notes the  notes and the  notes and the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility we may also be unable to take advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness see description of other indebtedness many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade by moodys and sp and no event of default has occurred and is continuing many of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade as defined in the indenture by moodys and sp provided that at such time no event of default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or if they are rated investment grade that the notes will maintain such ratings termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force see description of the notescertain covenants   s table of contents special note regarding forwardlooking statements statements included

convenience these operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them we take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters dtc has advised us that dtc is a limitedpurpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations collectively the participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of its participants the participants include securities brokers and dealers including the underwriters of the notes banks trust companies clearing corporations and certain other

that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own consequently the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global note to such persons will be limited to that extent because dtc can act only on behalf of participants which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a global note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests except as described below owners of an interest in the global notes will not have notes registered in their names will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the indenture for any purpose payments in respect of the principal of and interest if any on a global note registered in the name of dtc or

records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or  any other matter relating to the actions and practices of dtc or any of its participants or indirect participants dtc has advised us that its current practice upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes including principal and interest is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless dtc has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of dtc payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes

have given such direction however if there is an event of default under the notes dtc reserves the right to exchange the global notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such

successor depositary or b has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act  the issuer at its option notifies the trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the certificated notes or  there has occurred and is continuing a default with respect to the notes and the trustee has received a request from dtc to issue certificated notes in addition beneficial interests in a global note may be exchanged for certificated notes under prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of dtc in accordance with the indenture in all cases certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interests in global notes will be   s table of contents registered in the names and issued in any approved denominations requested by or on behalf of the depositary in accordance with its customary procedures same day settlement and payment the issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the global notes including principal and interest if any by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the global note holder the issuer will make all payments of principal and interest if any with respect to certificated notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the certificated notes or if no such account is specified by mailing a check to each such holders registered address the notes represented by the global notes are expected to trade in dtcs sameday funds settlement system and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will therefore be required by dtc to be settled in immediately available funds the issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in

purchase ownership and disposition of the notes issued pursuant to this offering but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects the effects of other us federal tax laws such as estate and gift tax laws and any applicable state local or foreign tax laws are not discussed this discussion is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code treasury regulations promulgated thereunder judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the us internal revenue service the irs in each case in effect as of the date hereof these authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the notes we have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the irs regarding the matters discussed below there can be no assurance the irs or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes this discussion is limited to holders who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of section  of the code generally property held for investment in addition this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the notes for cash at original issue and at their original issue price within the meaning of section  of the code ie the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the public for cash this discussion does not address all us federal income tax consequences relevant to a holders particular circumstances including the impact of the medicare contribution tax on net investment income in addition it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules including without limitation        us expatriates and former citizens or longterm residents of the united states        persons subject to the alternative minimum tax        us holders as defined below whose functional currency is not the us dollar        persons holding the notes as part of a hedge straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment        banks insurance companies and other financial institutions        real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies        brokers

organizations and        persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the code if an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds the notes the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level accordingly partnerships holding the notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences to them   s table of contents investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the us federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes arising under other us federal tax laws including estate and gift tax laws under the laws of any state local or nonus taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty tax considerations applicable to us holders definition of a us holder for purposes of this discussion a us holder is a beneficial owner of a note that for us federal income tax purposes is or is treated as        an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation created or organized under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia        an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source or        a trust that  is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and the control of one or more united states persons within the meaning of section a of the code or  has a valid election in effect to be treated as a united states person for us federal income tax purposes payments of interest interest on a note generally will be taxable to a us holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued in accordance with such us holders method of tax accounting for us federal income tax purposes it is expected and this discussion assumes that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for us federal income tax purposes certain additional payments in certain circumstances see description of the notesoptional redemption and description of the notesfundamental change we may be obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the principal amount of the notes we intend to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of these additional payments this position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood as of the date of issuance of the notes that such additional payments will have to be made assuming this position is respected any amounts paid to a us holder pursuant to any such redemption or repurchase as applicable would be taxable as described below in tax considerations applicable to us holderssale or other taxable disposition our position is binding on a us holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable treasury regulations the irs however may take a position contrary to our position which could affect the timing and character of a us holders income and the timing of our deductions with respect to the notes us holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the consequences thereof the remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments sale or other taxable disposition a us holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of a note the amount of such gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount   s table of contents received for the note in cash or other property valued at fair market value less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid interest which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously included in income and the us holders adjusted tax basis in the note a us holders adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be equal to the amount the us holder paid for the note any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of sale or other taxable disposition otherwise such gain or loss will be shortterm capital gain or loss longterm capital gains recognized by certain noncorporate us holders including individuals generally will be taxable at reduced rates the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations information reporting and backup withholding a us holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on a note or receives proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of a note including a redemption or

constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under section  of erisa andor section  of the code or comparable provisions of similar laws unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory class or individual prohibited transaction exemption in this regard the us department of labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
