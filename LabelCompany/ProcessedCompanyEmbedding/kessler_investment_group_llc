success below you will find information about our three investment strategies before opening an account we will meet with you to fully assess your investment objective and determine which portfolio might be right for you investment strategies at kessler investment group our goal is to help clients achieve their investment goals by delivering investment results that exceed their expectations the dividend income portfolio objective the dividend income portfolio is a diversified stock portfolio with the primary objective of providing a dividend yield that is consistent with that of the standard  poor’s ® index the portfolio’s secondary objective is to protect capital identify the universe the first step in the kig investment process is to identify the standard  poor’s ® index sectors that are expected to outperform the broader market to establish the list of sectors the portfolio manager applies the proprietary avp process once the sectors have been identified the portfolio manager will “drill down” to find stocks that meet the kig investment criteria these criteria are designed to identify companies with the following qualities • wellcapitalized with strong balance sheet • a history of consistent and growing dividend payments examine cash flow characteristics strong companies pay dividends to shareholders out of cash flow historically companies that have consistently increased their cash flows have rewarded their shareholders with increased dividends and superior total returns select companies the stocks selected for the portfolio are those that meet the kig investment objectives trade at attractive valuations and are likely to exceed market expectations for future cash flows kessler investment group llc is an investment adviser registered with the sec advisory services are only offered to clients or prospective clients where kessler investment group llc and its representatives are properly licensed or exempt from licensure the balanced portfolio objective the balanced portfolio is designed for investors looking for the stable income that can come from fixed income investments with the potential for growth that comes from equities portfolio construction the portfolio is constructed by blending highquality fixed income securities with the dividend income portfolio the target allocation of equity securities and bonds is determined based on the client’s initial interview at the time the account is opened during annual reviews or more frequently if necessary the allocation will be adjusted so as to remain consistent with the client’s investment objective portfolio weightings of equities vs fixed income will range in percentage from  equityfixed income to  equityfixed income as determined by the client’s objectives fixed income securities are selected based on the client’s liquidity needs and risk profile  kig selects fixed income securities that are considered “liquid” meaning there is an active market available for trading  fixed income securities selected may include but are not limited to individual bonds preferred stocks mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs kessler investment group llc is an investment adviser registered with the sec advisory services are only offered to clients or prospective clients where kessler investment group llc and its representatives are properly licensed or exempt from licensure the total return portfolio objective the total return portfolio is a diversified “go anywhere” portfolio which is comprised of individual stocks andor bonds that kig believes will deliver superior upside potential to that of the overall market as measured by the russell ® index at kig we believe avoiding downside risk is a key ingredient to achieving the portfolio’s objective this means the portfolio will not remain fully invested at all times when market conditions dictate the portfolio manager will reduce the portfolio’s exposure to the stock andor bond market identify the universe the first step in building the portfolio is to identify the stock market sectors which the kig investment process determines may outperform the broader market to establish the list of sectors kig applies the proprietary active vs passive “avp” process once the sectors have been identified we drill down to find the stocks that meet our investment criteria these criteria are designed to identify companies with the following qualities  wellcapitalized with a strong balance sheet record of financial strength and profit growth examine the technical picture the chart of a company’s stock price gives a history of what investors have been willing to pay for the company kig believes this is important information and gives the portfolio manager the opportunity to gauge whether the stock is overowned or ready to be accumulated stocks or bonds the kig approach is to use both stocks and bonds to achieve the portfolio’s objective of outperforming the broad market as measured by the russell ® index  at times bonds offer a better opportunity for upside returns than stocks to invest solely in stocks when the objective is total return decreases the chance for success portfolio selection the stocks and bonds selected for the portfolio are those that meet the investment objective of the portfolio exhibit attractive price charts and represent the “best of breed” within their
