government regulations to stop clear cutting of forests dumping toxic chemicals into streams bays rivers and lakes and to force dam removal  people are motivated by greed not stewardship  sometimes the big stick of government regulation is necessary  if you dont have enough common sense not to build your house on an earthquake fault lahar path flood plain or wobbly hillside then somebody is needed to tell you no minoudemimonde jackmurphyrgr colonelprop muslim canibalism ok backs away slowly minoudemimonde waterborne i find that environmentalists want the same things that i do clean water cleaner air and good earth to grow food on unfortunately they think that the government can legislate this they’re wrong while there are things that are really egregious and need to be dealt with immediately for the most part the thing that drives true environmentalism—such as cutting car emissions and cutting sulfates out of the cleaning products we use—have come from the economy if people want it companies will provide it i also find it kind of sad that people will protest over global warming and out dependence on oil while wearing oilbased products and the fact that they have no clue that the real problem these days is india and china and if they can convince them to go with the tokyo protocols then they can part the red sea as well the problem i have with global warming is that we are so young in this science we really don’t have anywhere near the experience or scientific understanding that we need to have to know what is going on with our planet everything i have read—and i have read quite a bit—has been lacking in the scientific method somewhere and the same questions that i have had from the beginning when they were saying that the earth was cooling and we were heading

associated with hereditary ecclesiastical office among certain custodian families of monasteries and churches later the office of erenagh passed into the hands of laymen after the disorder of the norse wars in the th and th centuries the erenaghs were generally lay families who controlled the lands and therefore the economic base of the important churches and monasteries on behalf of the overlord clan in turn the erenagh received part of the rents from the land and normally held their own mensal estate which was generally hereditary and passed down among the principal family lineage irish derbhfine and occupied by the chief of the erenagh family the erenagh families held high social status and were often at odds with the ecclesiastical authorities over the ownership and management of church lands and were often in conflict with rival churches located in hostile clan lands some erenagh families maintained their influence over ecclesiastical property right down until the collapse of the gaelic social system in the beginning of the th century because of the proliferation of lay erenagh families there are many unrelated erenagh families throughout ireland the name mcinerney is by far the most popular form of the irish mac an airchinnigh and the most numerous as well indeed by  the surname mcinerney was the seventh most popular in county clare though it seems that its popularity sank over time as many of the family emigrated from clare during the course of the th century nonetheless the name is well established in its historical homeland of co clare where it is still a well known local surname the surname mcinerney has retained a relatively close phonetic approximation of the original irish surname mac an oirchinnigh aka mac an airchinnigh son of the airchinneach which has been anglicised in many different forms such as mcenerhynny mcinerhenny mckinnerteny nerhinny mcenearney mcenerney mcnertny and even kinnerk another well known erenagh family is the presentday family of nerney found in county roscommon and who historically were the erenaghs of st patricks church in the diocese of elphin and at tuam their forebears are occasionally mentioned in the irish annals during the middle ages in ad for example and also among the native irish who received transplanter certificates in the s in the vicinity of stokestown despite their ancient lineage the roscommon nerneys appear not to have been as numerous as the mcinerneys of county clare who historically are an offshoot of the important dál gcais line of the powerful mcnamaras of eastern county clare historically known as clanncuilein mcinerney of thomondedit the mcinerney surname gave rise to a well known sept based in eastern thomond or co clare where the name was first recorded in the early th century document triumphs of torlough caithréim thoirdhealbhaigh in the triumphs of torlough the mcinerney sept is referred to on several occasions as being followers of the mcnamaras and were present at the battle of dysert odea in  in which the english forces under de clare were decisively defeated the sept was an offshoot of the powerful mcnamara clan and tracing their descent to the th century donnchadha mac con mara donnough macnamara who was recorded as an airchinneach erenagh and from whom his son took the name mac an airchinnigh ie‘son of the airchinneach’ some pedigrees indicate that this donnchadha mac con mara was the brother of cu mara beg the lord of ui caisin who was slain in  and one of the early chiefs of the leading branch of the mac con mara family this would suggest that the mcinerneys were an offshoot sept of the leading mac con mara household of eastern clare it is possible that this donnchadh mac con mara was an airchinneach based at killaloe or another religious establishment in east clare the sept held extensive lands in the townlands of ballysallagh ballynacraggie and dromoland parish of kilnasoolagh near presentday newmarketonfergus and were recorded as being in possession of the tower houses of ballynacraggie and ballysallagh during the th and th centuries respectively these lands seem to have been the traditional ‘mensal lands’ of the head of the mcinerney sept as the leading members of the family were variously recorded as residing on these lands from the s–s according to papers the antiquarian r w twigge copied the mcinerneys built dromoland castle and ballyconeely castle of which the former has been rebuilt and was until recently the residence of the obrien earl of inchiquin and the latter destroyed r w twigge based his research off an thcentury irishman named william o’lionain who wrote that thomas the son of shane mac anerheny erected dromoland – probably between the s–s the elizabethan inquisition records legal assessments of property transactions of the late th century refer to a longrunning land dispute between the two leading factions of the mcinerneys according to the inquisition record of  inquisition taken at ennis on the may  st year of elizabeth before john crofton finds that john m‘inerney late of ballykilty died on the november   seized in fee of ballysallagh and ballykilty that mahone m‘inerney aged  at his father’s death is the son and heir of said john finds that mahone son of loghlen and mahone’s son loghlen the younger both relations of john had laid claim to his lands and appropriated them to their own use for thirteen years past a subsequent inquisition in  during the reign of james i found that inquisition taken at the windmill on the march   by humphrey wynch finds that mahone son of loghlen macinerney died at ballysallagh on the november   being then owner in fee of ballysallagh ballykilty with its watermill and of carrigoran and leaving his son loghlen his heiratlaw this son died at carrigoran on the november   leaving his son donogh then aged six years but now of full age as his heir finds that mahone son of john macinerney disputes the right of his cousin to the ownership of these lands alleging that his father john who was the true owner had died at dromoland on the november  in the th year of the reign of queen elizabeth leaving him the said mahone his son and heir a subsequent inquisition taken in  finds that mahone had been in possession and that he died about the year  leaving a son john to succeed him a man then of full age clan mcinerney at the time of elizabeth iedit several members of the family are variously recorded in the elizabethan fiant records as receiving pardons for various rebellious acts during the upheavals of the searly th century it can be surmised that most of the rebellious activity was due to the crown’s push for control of feudal duties and rents that were paid by the urraghts or lesser landowners to their more powerful overlord clans such as the o’briens and mcnamaras the english policy of establishing a fixed rent for land that was to be paid to the english administration was consolidated in the  agreement known as the composition of connaught during this period the elizabethan fiants record a mahowne mcshane mcinerrihine of ballykilly sic ballykilty co clare gent as obtaining a pardon in  for rebellious activities the same man maghowne mcinerinn of ballesolloghe gent was again record as being pardoned for rebellion in  while in  a mahowne ne teige mcinyrrymy of ballsallagh and a john sellenger mcenerie of ballisallagh gent were recorded as pardoned rebels it is interesting to note that these last two references appeared in the aftermath of tyrones rebellion and these landowners possibly had some local involvement as some thomond clans supported hugh oneill despite the earl of thomonds support for the tudor royal forces the two reliable lists of gentlemen and their castles in thomond during the reign of elizabeth record a mcenerhyney no first name given as having possession a tower house at ballynacraggie now destroyed in  while the list of castles and their gentlemen in  conspicuously leaves the entry for ballynacraggie blank but does record a conogher oge macclancy a brehon as being the occupier of ballysallagh castle – a castle and lands that in the th century were closely associated with the mcinerneys despite the upheavals following the composition of connaught and the land changes of the early th century such as the introduction of english common law and the abolition of brehon law the sept as a whole remained undisplaced as in  they held in fee over  irish acres around  statute acres of good pasture land all primarily in the parishes of kilnasoolagh quin and clonloghlan from these records it appears that three main branches of the sept were active those associated with the lands in and around clonloghlan parish centered on the townland of caherteige and probably a junior line of the family another leading branch headed by mahone mcinerney centred on the parish of kilnasoolagh especially in the townland of ballysallagh and a third branch which may have a close connection with the ballysallagh mcinerneys centered exclusively on the townland of ballykilty in the parish of quin and represented by john mcinerney it was this john mcinerney who appears a direct descendant of the mcinerney airchinneach line from the th century as shown by several gaelic genealogical tracts of the family and also from an unregistered milesian pedigree currently lodged in the genealogical office in dublin showing that on the death of mathghamhain mahone mac an oirchinnigh in  his son john was his sole heir seventeenthcentury upheavalsedit the cromwellian settlement of  resulted in a massive loss of lands and influence for the mcinerneys with much of their ancestral lands transferred in ownership to sir henry ingoldsby much of the remainder of the sept sank in poverty and relative obscurity by the beginning of the th century notably at least one member of the family suffered martyrdom during the cromwellian wars and whose description comes down to us through fr anthony macbrodys th century compilation propugnaculum catholicæ veritatis in  were also hanged hugh carrige a parish priest roger m‘namara daniel clancy and jeremiah mcinerney friars of quin convent who were born in tradree it appears that jeremiah mcinerney was born of wealthy tradree parents related to the bunratty barony and according to other descriptions he was initially beaten with sticks and after refusing to recant his catholic faith the cromwellian soldiers then dragged him to a tree and hanged him edward maclysaght in his book the surnames of ireland also mentions a fr lawrence mcinerheny who was martyred in  however there appears to be no reference to this individual in the historical record the  census shows that several members of the family described as gent managed to hold on to some of their traditional lands while others were recorded in the transplantation to connacht book as of receiving less fertile land in the north and west of co clare because of their ‘rebellious activities’ during the  uprising several leading mcinerneys were transplanted from their original lands in bunratty barony to other areas including the infamous burren it appears that several members of the family were active during the  rebellion most notably loghlin mcinerney who was present at the siege of ballyally castle he possibly served as a justice of the peace for the o’brien earl of thomond and mahone mcinerney both of these men were recorded as being transplanted under the transplantation to connacht scheme but it is likely that at least mahone maintained a portion of his previous lands as evidenced by his record  as having  subtenants on his lands in kilnasoolagh parish several other prominent mcinerneys were recorded in the  census and the name was ranked as one of the more numerous in the barony of bunratty having  tituladoes landowners of some merit in the barony of bunratty john mcinerhidny gent held lands in dromkeeny in the parish of killraghtrish along with  tenants under him this john could have been the john mcinerney who occupied ballykilty near quin in  nearby bunratty is the barony of inchiquin where loghlen mcinerny gent held lands in rathrahan east and a total of  tenants this loghlen is probably the loghlen mcinerney who was an active rebel in the  uprising and was one of the besiegers of ballyally castle his name also appears in the transportation to connacht lists as receiving several  acres  m of regranted lands in inchiquin barony and interesting a loghlen mcinerney is recorded as the senechal of the earl of inchiquin manor courts in the s further afield covara mcinerny gent held lands and  tenants in ballyconna south in the parish of killneeny in burren barony this covera may be the son of mahone mcinerney of ballysallagh as the namesake cowerra mcinerney was recorded as holding lands there in  and is later recorded in the inchiquin manuscripts as undertaking a land contract at ballysallagh in the s from these records it appears that covara is used interchangeably with the names cumaracowerra in the townland of fyntra in kilferboy parish in the barony of ibricknane teige mcinerny gent is recorded as holding land and  tenants in joint with several other tituladoes numerous references to the name can be found in the inchiquin manuscripts and in other various documents dealing with th and th century land transactions after the loss of their ancestral estates members of the family dispersed into the surrounding counties becoming relatively numerous in galway and limerick as well as in tipperary as can be found in the tithe applotment books c and the griffth valuation c records mcinerneys were quite numerous in co clare as well as in limerick city and in clusters around the killaloe and ballina area as well as in the district of castletownarra in northwest tipperary following the – famine many of family emigrated to the us canada uk australia and new zealand by  some mcinerneys were still located on lands nearby their traditional patrimony in kilnasoolagh parish and in that year a patrick mcinerney of clenagh held  acres  m outright as a landowner mcinerney folkloreedit according to the compilation of clare folk stories by the antiquarian tj westropp stories from the peasantry point toward a connection between the mcinerneys and massive ironage hillfort at moghane nearby newmarketonfergus near sixmilebridge the tale ran that in early days meihan mac enerheny a famous warrior made the huge fort or rather hill town of moghan as a ‘fightingring’ for himself he would never allow his tribe to go to war until he had himself challenged and defeated all the enemy’s chiefs he reigned in great esteem from the fergus to the owennagarna river in his fightingring he always gave his opponents the choice of the sun and wind in despite of which he overthrew them all there was no king nor soldier nor monster that he feared to fight his admiring tribe gave him a goldembroidered cap and the name of oircheannach golden head and he died unconquered i have never heard this tale in the neighbourhood of the fort it seems artificial and based on a folkderivation to flatter the macinerneys it is perhaps genuine though late it should be pointed out however that the translation of ‘oircheannach’ or airchinneach as ‘golden head’ is erroneous as it is the irish word óir that means gold the combined word airchinneach air noble  ceann head  is clearly the old irish term for erenagh or steward of churches lands nonetheless it should be remembered that moghane hillfort lies almost adjunct to the traditional mcinerney lands of dromoland ballynacraggie and ballysallagh other originsedit another interesting reference is that of a thcentury manuscript held at the royal irish academy and was scribed by conchubhair mac in oirchinnigh of baile ban ballybawn in clare the scribal note sets out his direct paternal line stretching back to the th century and claims descent from donnchadha mac con mara the th century progenitor of the mcinerney line and erenagh of cill da luadh killaloe the note also refers to the mcinerneys as loyal chiefs of the lands of caherteige clonloghan drumgeely and tullyvarragh which locate nearby to the presentday shannon airport it is possible that these lands consisted of the original mcinerney patrimony and were awarded to the sept for services rendered as erenaghs however by the mid th century we can be sure to say that while there was a mcinerney interest in these lands it was only caherteige that was owned in fee simple by a junior branch of the family represented by murtagh and daniel sons of donagh mcinerney the surname should not be confused with the phonetically similar surname mcenery macenery maceniry of uí fidgenti origin not dalcassian these macenerys thus cousins of the odonovans held large estates in southwest limerick well after the disintegration of uí fidgenti in the th century and were associated with their feudal overlord fizmaurice of desmond in irish macenery is mac inneirghe derived from eirghe ‘to arise’ and the sept held extensive lands in

under de clare were decisively defeated the sept was an offshoot of the powerful mcnamara clan and tracing their descent to the th century donnchadha mac con mara donnough macnamara who was recorded as an airchinneach erenagh and from whom his son took the name mac an airchinnigh ie‘son of the airchinneach’ some pedigrees indicate that this donnchadha mac con mara was the brother of cu mara beg the lord of ui caisin who was slain in  and one of the early chiefs of the leading branch of the mac con mara family this would suggest that the mcinerneys were an offshoot sept of the leading mac con mara household of eastern clare it is possible that this donnchadh mac con mara was an airchinneach based at killaloe or another religious establishment in east clare the sept held extensive lands in the townlands of ballysallagh ballynacraggie and dromoland parish of kilnasoolagh near presentday newmarketonfergus and were recorded as being in possession of the tower houses of ballynacraggie and ballysallagh during the th and th centuries respectively these lands seem to have been the traditional ‘mensal lands’ of the head of the mcinerney sept as the leading members of the family were variously recorded as residing on these lands from the s–s according to papers the antiquarian r w twigge copied the mcinerneys built dromoland castle and ballyconeely castle of which the former has been rebuilt and was until recently the residence of the obrien earl of inchiquin and the latter destroyed r w twigge based his research off an thcentury irishman named william o’lionain who wrote that thomas the son of shane mac anerheny erected dromoland – probably between the s–s the elizabethan inquisition records legal assessments of property transactions of the late th century refer to a longrunning land dispute between the two leading factions of the mcinerneys according to the inquisition record of  inquisition taken at ennis on the may  st year of elizabeth before john crofton finds that john m‘inerney late of ballykilty died on the november   seized in fee of ballysallagh and ballykilty that mahone m‘inerney aged  at his father’s death is the son and heir of said john finds that mahone son of loghlen and mahone’s son loghlen the younger both relations of john had laid claim to his lands and appropriated them to their own use for thirteen years past a subsequent inquisition in  during the reign of james i found that inquisition taken at the windmill on the march   by humphrey wynch finds that mahone son of loghlen macinerney died at ballysallagh on the

variously recorded in the elizabethan fiant records as receiving pardons for various rebellious acts during the upheavals of the searly th century it can be surmised that most of the rebellious activity was due to the crown’s push for control of feudal duties and rents that were paid by the urraghts or lesser landowners to their more powerful overlord clans such as the o’briens and mcnamaras the english policy of establishing a fixed rent for land that was to be paid to the english administration was consolidated in the  agreement known as the composition of connaught during this period the elizabethan fiants record a mahowne mcshane mcinerrihine of ballykilly sic ballykilty co clare gent as obtaining a pardon in  for rebellious activities the same man maghowne mcinerinn of ballesolloghe gent was again record as being pardoned for rebellion in  while in  a mahowne ne teige mcinyrrymy of ballsallagh and a john sellenger mcenerie of ballisallagh gent were recorded as pardoned rebels it is interesting to note that these last two references appeared in the aftermath of tyrones rebellion and these landowners possibly had some local involvement as some thomond clans supported hugh oneill despite the earl of thomonds support for the tudor royal forces the two reliable lists of gentlemen and their castles in thomond during the reign of elizabeth record a mcenerhyney no first name given as having possession a tower house at ballynacraggie now destroyed in  while the list of castles and their gentlemen in  conspicuously leaves the entry for ballynacraggie blank but does record a conogher oge macclancy a brehon as being the occupier of ballysallagh castle – a castle and lands that in the th century were closely associated with the mcinerneys despite the upheavals following the composition of connaught and the land changes of the early th century such as the introduction of english common law and the abolition of brehon law the sept as a whole remained undisplaced as in  they held in fee over  irish acres around  statute acres of good pasture land all primarily in the parishes of kilnasoolagh quin and clonloghlan from these records it appears that three main branches of the sept were active those associated with the lands in and around clonloghlan parish centered on the townland of caherteige and probably a junior line of the family another leading branch headed by mahone mcinerney centred on the parish of kilnasoolagh especially in the townland of ballysallagh and a third branch which may have a close connection with the ballysallagh mcinerneys centered exclusively on the townland of ballykilty in the parish of quin and represented by john mcinerney it was this john mcinerney who appears a direct descendant of the mcinerney airchinneach line from the th century as shown by several gaelic genealogical tracts of the family and also from an unregistered milesian pedigree currently lodged in the genealogical office in dublin showing that on the death of mathghamhain mahone mac an oirchinnigh in  his son john was his sole heir seventeenthcentury upheavalsedit the cromwellian settlement of  resulted in a massive loss of lands and influence for the mcinerneys with much of their ancestral lands transferred in ownership to sir henry ingoldsby much of the remainder of the sept sank in poverty and relative obscurity by the beginning of the th century notably at least one member of the family suffered martyrdom during the cromwellian wars and whose description comes down to us through fr anthony macbrodys th century compilation propugnaculum catholicæ veritatis in  were also hanged hugh carrige a parish priest roger m‘namara daniel clancy and jeremiah mcinerney friars of quin convent who were born in tradree it appears that jeremiah mcinerney was born of wealthy tradree parents related to the bunratty barony and according to other descriptions he was initially beaten with sticks and after refusing to recant his catholic faith the cromwellian soldiers then dragged him to a tree and hanged him edward maclysaght in his book the surnames of ireland also mentions a fr lawrence mcinerheny who was martyred in  however there appears to be no reference to this individual in the historical record the  census shows that several members of the family described as gent managed to hold on to some of their traditional lands while others were recorded in the transplantation to connacht book as of receiving less fertile land in the north and west of co clare because of their ‘rebellious activities’ during the  uprising several leading mcinerneys were transplanted from their original lands in bunratty barony to other areas including the infamous burren it appears that several members of the family were active during the  rebellion most notably loghlin mcinerney who was present at the siege of ballyally castle he possibly served as a justice of the peace for the o’brien earl of thomond and mahone mcinerney both of these men were recorded as being transplanted under the transplantation to connacht scheme but it is likely that at least mahone maintained a portion of his previous lands as evidenced by his record  as having  subtenants on his lands in kilnasoolagh parish several other prominent mcinerneys were recorded in the  census and the name was ranked as one of the more numerous in the barony of bunratty having  tituladoes landowners of some merit in the barony of bunratty john mcinerhidny gent held lands in dromkeeny in the parish of killraghtrish along with  tenants under him this john could have been the john mcinerney who occupied ballykilty near quin in  nearby bunratty is the barony of inchiquin where loghlen mcinerny gent held lands in rathrahan east and a total of  tenants this loghlen is probably the loghlen mcinerney who was an active rebel in the  uprising and was one of the besiegers of ballyally castle his name also appears in the transportation to connacht lists as receiving several  acres  m of regranted lands in inchiquin barony and interesting a loghlen mcinerney is recorded as the senechal of the earl of inchiquin manor courts in the s further afield covara mcinerny gent held lands and  tenants in ballyconna south in the parish of killneeny in burren barony this covera may be the son of mahone mcinerney of ballysallagh as the namesake cowerra mcinerney was recorded as holding lands there in  and is later recorded in the inchiquin manuscripts as undertaking a land contract at ballysallagh in the s from these records it appears that covara is used interchangeably with the names cumaracowerra in the townland of fyntra in kilferboy parish in the barony of ibricknane teige mcinerny gent is recorded as holding land and  tenants in joint with several other tituladoes numerous references to the name can be found in the inchiquin manuscripts and in other various documents dealing with th and th century land transactions after the loss of their ancestral estates members of the family dispersed into the surrounding counties becoming relatively numerous in galway and limerick as well as in tipperary as can be found in the tithe applotment books c and the griffth valuation c records mcinerneys were quite numerous in co clare as well as in limerick city and in clusters around the killaloe and ballina area as well as in the district of castletownarra in northwest tipperary following the – famine many of family emigrated to the us canada uk australia and new zealand by  some mcinerneys were still located on lands nearby their traditional patrimony in kilnasoolagh parish and in that year a patrick mcinerney of clenagh held  acres  m outright as a landowner mcinerney folkloreedit according to the compilation of clare folk stories by the antiquarian tj westropp stories from the peasantry point toward a connection between the mcinerneys and massive ironage hillfort at moghane nearby newmarketonfergus near sixmilebridge the tale ran that in early days meihan mac enerheny a famous warrior made the huge fort or rather hill town of moghan as a ‘fightingring’ for himself he would never allow his tribe to go to war until he had himself challenged and defeated all the enemy’s chiefs he reigned in great esteem from the fergus to the owennagarna river in his fightingring he always gave his opponents the choice of the sun and wind in despite of which he overthrew them all there was no king nor soldier nor monster that he feared to fight his admiring tribe gave him a goldembroidered cap and the name of oircheannach golden head and he died unconquered i have never heard this tale in the neighbourhood of the fort it seems artificial and based on a folkderivation to flatter the macinerneys it is perhaps genuine though late it should be pointed out however that the translation of ‘oircheannach’ or airchinneach as ‘golden head’ is erroneous as it is the irish word óir that means gold the combined word airchinneach air noble  ceann head  is clearly the old irish term for erenagh or steward of churches lands nonetheless it should be remembered that moghane hillfort lies almost adjunct to the traditional mcinerney lands of dromoland ballynacraggie and ballysallagh other originsedit another interesting reference is that of a thcentury manuscript held at the royal irish academy and was scribed by conchubhair mac in oirchinnigh of baile ban ballybawn in clare the scribal note sets out his direct paternal line stretching back to the th century and claims descent from donnchadha mac con mara the th century progenitor of the mcinerney line and erenagh of cill da luadh killaloe the note also refers to the mcinerneys as loyal chiefs of the lands of caherteige clonloghan drumgeely and tullyvarragh which locate nearby to the presentday shannon airport it is possible that these lands consisted of the original mcinerney patrimony and were awarded to the sept for services rendered as erenaghs however by the mid th century we can be sure to say that while there was a mcinerney interest in these lands it was only caherteige that was owned in fee simple by a junior branch of the family represented by murtagh and daniel sons of donagh mcinerney the surname should not be confused with the phonetically similar surname mcenery macenery maceniry of uí fidgenti origin not dalcassian these macenerys thus cousins of the odonovans held large estates in southwest limerick well after the disintegration of uí fidgenti in the th century and were associated with their feudal overlord fizmaurice of desmond in irish macenery is mac inneirghe derived from eirghe ‘to arise’ and the sept held extensive lands in castletown maceniry and several of

ballynacraggie founder donnchadha mac con mara the name mcinerney is of noble irish origin where it is found in the modern irish form of mac an airchinnigh pronounced mockonarckenny and in the old and literary form of mac an oirchinnigh and mac an oirchindig the pronunciation of mac an oirchinnigh has led the name to be sometimes anglicised as mcenherheny in irish documents from the th–th centuries the name is derived from the irish mac an oirchinnigh meaning ‘son of the erenagh’ erenagh in irish being airchinneach literally meaning son of the lord of church lands the irish word airchinneach may derive from its twin components of ‘air’ noble and ceann head therefore meaning a ‘noblehead’ or ‘lord’ denoting its aristocratic status in medieval ireland the coat of arms is three red lions passant

originsedit see also early medieval ireland  the erenagh was an important position in early medieval ireland and originally was associated with hereditary ecclesiastical office among certain custodian families of monasteries and churches later the office of erenagh passed into the hands of laymen after the disorder of the norse wars in the th and th centuries the erenaghs were generally lay families who controlled the lands and therefore the economic base of the important churches and monasteries on behalf of the overlord clan in turn the erenagh received part of the rents from the land and normally held their own mensal estate which was generally hereditary and passed down among the principal family lineage irish derbhfine and occupied by the chief of the erenagh family the erenagh families held high social status and were often at odds with the ecclesiastical authorities over the ownership and management of church lands and were often in conflict with rival churches located in hostile clan lands some erenagh families maintained their influence over ecclesiastical property right down until the collapse of the gaelic social system in the beginning of the th century because of the proliferation of lay erenagh families there are many unrelated erenagh families throughout ireland the name mcinerney is by far the most popular form of the irish mac an airchinnigh and the most numerous as well indeed by  the surname mcinerney was the seventh most popular in county clare though it seems that its popularity sank over time as many of the family emigrated from clare during the course of the th century nonetheless the name is well established in its historical homeland of co clare where it is still a well known local surname the surname mcinerney has retained a relatively close phonetic approximation of the original irish surname mac an oirchinnigh aka mac an airchinnigh son of the airchinneach which has been anglicised in many different forms such as mcenerhynny mcinerhenny mckinnerteny nerhinny mcenearney mcenerney mcnertny and even kinnerk another well known erenagh family is the presentday family of nerney found in county roscommon and who historically were the erenaghs of st patricks church in the diocese of elphin and at tuam their forebears are occasionally mentioned in the irish annals during the middle ages in ad for example and also among the native irish who received transplanter certificates in the s in the vicinity of stokestown despite their ancient lineage the roscommon nerneys appear not to have been as numerous as the mcinerneys of

ballynacraggie founder donnchadha mac con mara the name mcinerney is of noble irish origin where it is found in the modern irish form of mac an airchinnigh pronounced mockonarckenny and in the old and literary form of mac an oirchinnigh and mac an oirchindig the pronunciation of mac an oirchinnigh has led the name to be sometimes anglicised as mcenherheny in irish documents from the th–th centuries the name is derived from the irish mac an oirchinnigh meaning ‘son of the erenagh’ erenagh in irish being airchinneach literally meaning son of the lord of church lands the irish word airchinneach may derive from its twin components of ‘air’ noble and ceann head therefore meaning a ‘noblehead’ or ‘lord’ denoting its aristocratic status in medieval ireland the coat of arms is three red lions passant and the motto is veritas meaning truth in some places the motto can be found as vincit veritas meaning truth conquers or truth prevails contents  naming conventions  erenagh origins  mcinerney of

originsedit see also early medieval ireland  the erenagh was an important position in early medieval ireland and originally was associated with hereditary ecclesiastical office among certain custodian families of monasteries and churches later the office of erenagh passed into the hands of laymen after the disorder of the norse wars in the th and th centuries the erenaghs were generally lay families who controlled the lands and therefore the economic base of the important churches and monasteries on behalf of the overlord clan in turn the erenagh received part of the rents from the land and normally held their own mensal estate which was generally hereditary and passed down among the principal family lineage irish derbhfine and occupied by the chief of the erenagh family the erenagh families held high social status and were often at odds with the ecclesiastical authorities over the ownership and management of church lands and were often in conflict with rival churches located in hostile clan lands some erenagh families maintained their influence over ecclesiastical property right down until the collapse of the gaelic social system in the beginning of the th century because of the proliferation of lay erenagh families there are many unrelated erenagh families throughout ireland the name mcinerney is by far the most popular form of the irish mac an airchinnigh and the most numerous as well indeed by  the surname mcinerney was the seventh most popular in county clare though it seems that its popularity sank over time as many of the family emigrated from clare during the course of the th century nonetheless the name is well established in its historical homeland of co clare where it is still a well known local surname the surname mcinerney has retained a relatively close phonetic approximation of the original irish surname mac an oirchinnigh aka mac an airchinnigh son of the airchinneach which has been anglicised in many different forms such as mcenerhynny mcinerhenny mckinnerteny nerhinny mcenearney mcenerney mcnertny and even kinnerk another well known erenagh family is the presentday family of nerney found in county roscommon and who historically were the erenaghs of st patricks church in the diocese of elphin and at tuam their forebears are occasionally mentioned in the irish annals during the middle ages in ad for example and also among the native irish who received transplanter certificates in the s in the vicinity of stokestown despite their ancient lineage the roscommon nerneys appear not to have been as numerous as the mcinerneys of county clare who historically are an offshoot of the important dál gcais line of the powerful mcnamaras of eastern county clare historically known as clanncuilein mcinerney of thomondedit the mcinerney surname gave rise to a well known sept based in eastern thomond or co clare where the name was first recorded in the early th century document triumphs of torlough caithréim thoirdhealbhaigh in the triumphs of torlough the mcinerney sept is referred to on several occasions as being followers of the mcnamaras and were present at the battle of dysert odea in  in which the english forces under de clare were decisively defeated the sept was an offshoot of the powerful mcnamara clan and tracing their descent to the th century donnchadha mac con mara donnough macnamara who was recorded as an airchinneach erenagh and from whom his son took the name mac an airchinnigh ie‘son of the airchinneach’ some pedigrees indicate that this donnchadha mac con mara was the brother of cu mara beg the lord of ui caisin who was slain in  and one of the early chiefs of the leading branch of the mac con mara family this would suggest that the mcinerneys were an offshoot sept of the leading mac con mara household of eastern clare it is possible that this donnchadh mac con mara was an airchinneach based at killaloe or another religious establishment in east clare the sept held extensive lands in the townlands of ballysallagh ballynacraggie and dromoland parish of kilnasoolagh near presentday newmarketonfergus and were recorded as being in possession of the tower houses of ballynacraggie and ballysallagh during the th and th centuries respectively these lands seem to have been the traditional ‘mensal lands’ of the head of the mcinerney sept as the leading members of the family were variously recorded as residing on these lands from the s–s according to papers the antiquarian r w twigge copied the mcinerneys built dromoland castle and ballyconeely castle of which the former has been rebuilt and was until recently the residence of the obrien earl of inchiquin and the latter destroyed r w twigge based his research off an thcentury irishman named william o’lionain who wrote that thomas the son of shane mac anerheny erected dromoland – probably between the s–s the elizabethan inquisition records legal assessments of property transactions of the late th century refer to a longrunning land dispute between the two leading factions of the mcinerneys according to the inquisition record of  inquisition taken at ennis on the may  st year of elizabeth before john crofton finds that john m‘inerney late of ballykilty died on the november   seized in fee of ballysallagh and ballykilty that mahone m‘inerney aged  at his father’s death is the son and heir of said john finds that mahone son of loghlen and mahone’s son loghlen the younger both relations of john had laid claim to his lands and appropriated them to their own use for thirteen years past a subsequent inquisition in  during the reign of james i found that inquisition taken at the windmill on the march   by humphrey wynch finds that mahone son of loghlen macinerney died at ballysallagh on the november   being then owner in fee of ballysallagh ballykilty with its watermill and of carrigoran and leaving his son loghlen his heiratlaw this son died at carrigoran on the november   leaving his son donogh then aged six years but now of full age as his heir finds that mahone son of john macinerney disputes the right of his cousin to the ownership of these lands alleging that his father john who was the true owner had died at dromoland on the november  in the th year of the reign of queen elizabeth leaving him the said mahone his son and heir a subsequent inquisition taken in  finds that mahone had been in possession and that he died about the year  leaving a son john to succeed him a man then of full age clan mcinerney at the time of elizabeth iedit several members of the family are variously recorded in the elizabethan fiant records as receiving pardons for various rebellious acts during the upheavals of the searly th century it can be surmised that most of the rebellious activity was due to the crown’s push for control of feudal duties and rents that were paid by the urraghts or lesser landowners to their more powerful overlord clans such as the o’briens and mcnamaras the english policy of establishing a fixed rent for land that was to be paid to the english administration was consolidated in the  agreement known as the composition of connaught during this period the elizabethan fiants record a mahowne mcshane mcinerrihine of ballykilly sic ballykilty co clare gent as obtaining a pardon in  for rebellious activities the same man maghowne mcinerinn of ballesolloghe gent was again record as being pardoned for rebellion in  while in  a mahowne ne teige mcinyrrymy of ballsallagh and a john sellenger mcenerie of ballisallagh gent were recorded as pardoned rebels it is interesting to note that these last two references appeared in the aftermath of tyrones rebellion and these landowners possibly had some local involvement as some thomond clans supported hugh oneill despite the earl of thomonds support for the tudor royal forces the two reliable lists of gentlemen and their castles in thomond during the reign of elizabeth record a mcenerhyney no first name given as having possession a tower house at ballynacraggie now destroyed in  while the list of castles and their gentlemen in  conspicuously leaves the entry for ballynacraggie blank but does record a conogher oge macclancy a brehon as being the occupier of ballysallagh castle – a castle and lands that in the th century were closely associated with the mcinerneys despite the upheavals following the composition of connaught and the land changes of the early th century such as the introduction of english common law and the abolition of brehon law the sept as a whole remained undisplaced as in  they held in fee over  irish acres around  statute acres of good pasture land all primarily in the parishes of kilnasoolagh quin and clonloghlan from these records it appears that three main branches of the sept were active those associated with the lands in and around clonloghlan parish centered on the townland of caherteige and probably a junior line of the family another leading branch headed by mahone mcinerney centred on the parish of kilnasoolagh especially in the townland of ballysallagh and a third branch which may have a close connection with the ballysallagh mcinerneys centered exclusively on the townland of ballykilty in the parish of quin and represented by john mcinerney it was this john mcinerney who appears a direct descendant of the mcinerney airchinneach line from the th century as shown by several gaelic genealogical tracts of the family and also from an unregistered milesian pedigree currently lodged in the genealogical office in dublin showing that on the death of mathghamhain mahone mac an oirchinnigh in  his son john was his sole heir seventeenthcentury upheavalsedit the cromwellian settlement of  resulted in a massive loss of lands and influence for the mcinerneys with much of their ancestral lands transferred in ownership to sir henry ingoldsby much of the remainder of the sept sank in poverty and relative
