standard  we have virtually eliminated the sale of products so that we remain objective and avoid as many potential conflicts as possible  do you talk to me before making investment decisions when you engage shwm you grant us the discretion to make investment decisions and trades on your behalf as part of that process we will communicate to you in a timely manner the thought process behind the
