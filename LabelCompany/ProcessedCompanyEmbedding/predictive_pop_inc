microorganisms that cause spoilage however widespreadadoption of refrigerated storage of bulk raw milk and its subsequent delivery to the processing plants in cold chain has largelyeliminated spoilage of milk due to undesirable organisms this handling system of raw milk has resulted in the emergence of psychrotropic group of organisms that can multiply rapidly at or below   c irrespective of their optimum growth temperaturethe psychrotropic spore formers remain in heat processed cold stored milk and otherdairy foods these psychrotropic sporeformers are the reasons for spoilage of milk and milk products the presence of these organisms in milk and milk productsindicate not only unsanitary conditions but also the poor keeping quality of the products presence and multiplication of psychrotropic spore formers in milk is not only of concern as a public health hazard due to production of toxin by certainstrains but also a cause of economic losses through spoilagethe number of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria present in food has both health and financial implications and is of concern to everybody from food producers and processors to retailers and consumers traditional methods for enumeratingbacteria are not instantaneous and hence information only on the number of organisms that were present at the sampling timecan be gained it is often desirable to know the current bacterial population or the number that will be present in the future if aproduct is subjected to particular treatments information oninitial levels of contamination combined with knowledge on howbacterial number change allows present and future levels to be predictedfood microbiology has adopted modern methods and novel concepts with some reluctance many foodmicrobiologists follow the “old fashioned” approach of enumerating microbes at different stages of food storage identifyingthe major fractions of the microflora by their phenotypic characters and gradually building up an understanding of the shelflife and safety of foodshowever it is slow and expensive and has not led to a cumulative structured database of informationthat can be interrogated quickly study of the effects on microbial growth of single controlling factors such as temperature phor water activity resulted in acceptance that particular microbes of concern would not grow below certain temperatures orbelow a certain ph value or water activity some scientists recognized that other factors were important eg the compositionof the atmosphere above the food preservatives food structure but the experiments needed to cover the effects of all thosefactors appeared enormous and beyond the scope of individual food microbiologists not until the problem was viewed fromanother perspective was progress madeall foods contain water have a ph value and a temperature of storage if the growthresponse determined by those “controlling factors” could be measured then modeled the result would indicate how muchgrowth could be attributed to those three factorsif the differences between the calculated and observed responses weresignificant other factors would have to be taken into accountpredictive microbiology is a

use of predictive microbiology  evaluating the safety and stability of new formulations and identifying one that gives the desired shelflife  identifying potentially dangerous formulations   rita narayananet alijsid  international journal of science innovations and discoveriesvolume issuenovemberdecember   predicting the time taken by yeast to spoil a fruit juice  identify which microorganisms are likely to be the limiting factors with regard to food safety and spoilagepredictive microbiology is based on the hypothesis that growth is an intrinsic characteristic of the organism and willoccur reproducibly inthe same environment thus by measuring growth once it is possible to tell how a future population willdevelop under the same conditions in its simplest form these types of predictions can be made from graphs showing thenumber of bacteria measured in samples taken during growth against time the points on the growth curve will show a trendallowing the population at any time to be estimated by interpolation the trend can also be described mathematically by agrowth functionits earliest appearance isprobably esty and meyer  who described the thermal death of  clostridium botulinum type a spores by a loglinear model which is still used to estimate the necessary heat processing of lowacid canned foodsthis model simply says that at a given temperature the relative or specific death rate of the bacteria is constant with timein other words the percentage of the cell population inactivated in a unit time is constanta step forward was taken by scott  who investigated how the specific death rate depended on the availablewater quantified today by the socalled water activity a dimensionless number between  dry and  wet he subsequentlystudied the effect of the temperature on the specific microbial death rateit is generally agreed that the most important environmental factor determining growth is the temperature followedby the ph and water activity followed by preservatives antimicrobials and the composition of the atmosphere howeverwhile the temperature is controllable during the storage of the food the other environmental conditions are not furthermorethey can be changed by the growing bacteria and they can affect each other interactions this increased the need fordynamic models when the constant environment would just be a special case zerovariation of the general scenario whenthe environment can change with time another aim was to use more mechanistic models ie to describe the mechanismbehind the observed process by models based on laws of fundamental sciences as opposed to the empirical models drivenprimarily by datafittingmcmeekin et al  defined it as a quantitative science that enables users to evaluate objectively the effect of processing distribution and storage operations onthe microbiological safety and quality of foods later the same authorsused the expression “quantitaive microbial ecology of food” which is a somewhat more generic description the most recent book on the field mckellar and xu  puts more emphasison the need to describe the microbial response to the foodenvironments by mathematical modelsbaranyi and roberts published three papers   and  that gave a good mathematical basis formechanistic modeling of the lag phase that theory was recently validated experimentally by elfwing et al  using a flowchamber and an automated image analyzer to enable observation of divisions of thousands of single cells and to derivestatistical distributions of them by the s the squarerootsecondary model of ratkowsky  had become the most popular to describe the effect of temperature on the specific growth rate just  years ago very few food microbiologistsbelieved that models of microbial growth and death would never be sufficiently reliable to be used in the food industry or byfood regulators from the early empirical models a new generation of modeling approaches together with
