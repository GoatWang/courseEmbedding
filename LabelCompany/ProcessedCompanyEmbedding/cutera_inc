comments ive had multiple treatments with cutera products and have had excellent results the hair removal was much more effective than the previous location i went to i have also had trusculpt for body contouring on my lower body and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone i am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results the staff at cutera have been amazing they are friendly professional and ethical i highly recommend cutera and their products i echo the other reviews cutera does not stand behind their products they sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly they give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty we have other lasers that we use more and dont break as often and the company works with us terrible customer service i have owned two cutera lasers in the past i would never buy another they are prone to malfunction and when they do the cost to repair is ridiculous over  just to walk in the door even if it is only a minor problem i have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that cutera provides and the other lasers are much more reliable you would think that spending over k on a laser that cutera would want to treat their customers better i drive a mercedes customer service is impeccable that is why i continue to buy mercedes the opposite is true for cutera i will never buy again i have a cutera excel v that was in perfect condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working of course  cutera wanted  k to repair it as i thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep chris these lasers never break down since theyre solid state it has been three months since i have the use of this laser between trying to have qusar laser repair and cutera try to fix it according to danny the cutera laser technician it was my fault that i scratched the plug then the fiber broke since i didnt exactly place the plug into the laser look at their financial statement  they reap  of their income on repairs this is another scam company that i hope to see in court i have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance if you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with do not buy a medical laser from this company everything is made very cheaply from the plugs wires logos glasses pedals stands for the wands they put computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulsesthe hand pieces are not cheap depending on which you are using ipl  k titan k the warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing well they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working only then it is up to the discretion and if time permits that the technician will do so hopefully when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you dont get your service if you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out withthe service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over they base the need of the repairs through the error codes the laser flashes at you half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges they told me  years ago i need a new mother board and that it would cost k urging me to get the warranty when i looked into exactly what the warranty covered i realized this was another up sale attempt boy was i right with a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts the best being  some of these parts like a new nd yag wand is  they keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts you might not think this is a big deal but my laser computer board broke down the first  months i had it along with the foot pedal of course the comment from cutera was oh ive never seen this happen the reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale they sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit they lie to you and tell you im not selling any more lasers in your area then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area when you go to purchase they dont tell you about the new advances and  weeks later your  equipment in yesterday news all their eye wear falls apart ive had to replace all mine from china my suggestion is buy another laser product and check the ability to get parts  service outside of the maker you may need to get service from another provider someday and you dont want to be extorted and abused cutera is a monopoly that you dont want to play with cutera unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by

write a review events talk log in     bayshore blvdbrisbane ca    i disagree with the previous comments ive had multiple treatments with cutera products and have had excellent results the hair removal was much more effective than the previous location i went to i have also had trusculpt for body contouring on my lower body and definitely noticed a difference in shape and tone i am currently undergoing treatment for tattoo removal and am impressed with the results the staff at cutera have been amazing they are friendly professional and ethical i highly recommend cutera and their products i echo the other reviews cutera does not stand behind their products they sell you a laser as a workhorse and after the warranty expires it breaks constantly they give you attitude for not paying thousands a year for an extended warranty we have other lasers that we use more and dont break as often and the company works with us terrible customer service i have owned two cutera lasers in the past i would never buy another they are prone to malfunction and when they do the cost to repair is ridiculous over  just to walk in the door even if it is only a minor problem i have owned other lasers and have not had the poor service that cutera provides and the other lasers are much more reliable you would think that spending over k on a laser that cutera would want to treat their customers better i drive a mercedes customer service is impeccable that is why i continue to buy mercedes the opposite is true for cutera i will never buy again i have a cutera excel v that was in perfect condition one month before the one year warranty expired but then it stopped working of course  cutera wanted  k to repair it as i thought their warrant extension price was ridiculous and according to my sales rep chris these lasers never break down since theyre solid state it has been three months since i have the use of this laser between trying to have qusar laser repair and cutera try to fix it according to danny the cutera laser technician it was my fault that i scratched the plug then the fiber broke since i didnt exactly place the plug into the laser look at their financial statement  they reap  of their income on repairs this is another scam company that i hope to see in court i have owned other lasers from other companies without this type of performance if you love to flush money down the toilet this is the company to deal with do not buy a medical laser from this company everything is made very cheaply from the plugs wires logos glasses pedals stands for the wands they put computer chips inside the hand pieces to turn off at a certain amount of pulsesthe hand pieces are not cheap depending on which you are using ipl  k titan k the warranty is only as good the technician that comes out to fix the machine upon buying a new device and purchasing the warranty the manual states you need to have frequent servicing well they never come out to provide the service unless it is not working only then it is up to the discretion and if time permits that the technician will do so hopefully when the technician comes out he brings all his tools and supplies like distilled water otherwise you dont get your service if you let the technician use your laser tools be careful he does strip the cheap aluminum metal device used to torque the sapphire out withthe service reps answering the phone in the corporate office always try and up sell you when your warranty is over they base the need of the repairs through the error codes the laser flashes at you half the time the codes are redundant wherefore so are the charges they told me  years ago i need a new mother board and that it would cost k urging me to get the warranty when i looked into exactly what the warranty covered i realized this was another up sale attempt boy was i right with a second time purchase of the warranty you have options how much to pay on the parts the best being  some of these parts like a new nd yag wand is  they keep the old parts and refurbish them and trade out your new parts when you need repairs and give you even older parts you might not think this is a big deal but my laser computer board broke down the first  months i had it along with the foot pedal of course the comment from cutera was oh ive never seen this happen the reps are rude and never have time to visit you regarding the equipment once they have made the sale they sell others businesses near by you the same equipment so the area you work in is force to be very competitive in prices lowering the price point and ability to make a profit they lie to you and tell you im not selling any more lasers in your area then they sell to a franchise who sets up shop in your area when you go to purchase

paying thousands a year for an extended warranty we have other lasers that we use more and dont break as often and the company works with us i disagree with the previous comments ive had multiple treatments with cutera products and have had excellent results the hair removal was much more effective than the previous location i went to i have also had trusculpt for body contouring on my lower
