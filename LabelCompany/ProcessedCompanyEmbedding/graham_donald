‘hand of god’ homesubscribe advertisement sign up for the breitbart email newsletter sign me up franklin graham donald trump won election by the ‘hand of god’ reuters by thomas d williams phd dec   dec   dec  celebrated evangelical rev franklin graham says that it was the “hand of god” rather than russian hackers that determined the outcome of november’s presidential election “i think maybe god has allowed donald trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges” he saidadvertisement the son of renowned baptist minister billy graham the rev franklin graham has been invited by presidentelect trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation benediction and several readings at his swearingin ceremony on january  in an interview with religion news service thursday graham said that beyond mere human factors the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections “all i know is donald trump was supposed to lose the election” according to all the polls graham said “for these states to go the way they did in my opinion i think it was the hand of god” he said “it wasn’t hacking it wasn’t wikileaky or whatever it was god in my opinion and i believe his hand was at work and i think he’s given christians an opportunity” while never officially endorsing trump rev graham has been a sharp critic of the obama administration and a vocal opponent of hillary clinton especially for her uncompromising support of abortionondemand shortly before election day graham declared that the best choice for president “isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a christian” in evident reference to republican candidate donald trump “there’s two different pictures and two different visions for america” graham said in early november “the democratic party has a vision hillary clinton has a vision donald trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the republican party this isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a christian” the evangelist acknowledged that for many voting for trump might not have been easy but he insisted that it was nonetheless the better choice and that trump was a “changed man” “you may have to hold your nose and vote” graham said “i have people that say ‘well i don’t like donald trump i don’t like what he says’ well i don’t like what he said either i promise i don’t like it but those are things that he said  years ago not something that he said today” “i think donald trump has changed” graham added “i think god is working on his heart and in his life but people have to make up their own mind” in a facebook post some weeks earlier graham had stated that “the difference between the candidates is night and day” “some candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children” he said “yet they spent their entire career fighting against the rights of unborn children” graham said hillary clinton’s progressive agenda was “godless” and could not be defended following wikileaks revelations the preacher denounced the “depth of corruption” in washington politics calling for its eradication “wikileaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation’s capital” graham wrote calling it “a swamp that needs to be drained” “our political system is broken and it will take strong tough leadership to begin fixing some of this” graham said regarding the inauguration ceremony graham says he still has not decided which scripture passage to read “i’m taking time just to pray and ask god to give me wisdom and guidance because it’s a responsibility that i take very seriously” he said follow thomas d williams on twitter follow

individuals had a more liberal perspective but no one was preaching rebellion against the overall moral coderespected journalist david aikman articulated this very well in an oped published recently on charismanewscom ive known aikman now retired since the s when he was a senior foreign correspondent for time magazine he says america had a civic religion in those days—a basic christian morality reinforced by the preaching of evangelists like billy grahamdonald trump was a product of that era he grew up a nominal christian with traditional moral values it was only later that he became more libertarian on matters such as homosexualityafter the campus upheavals and the antiwar movement of the s aikman says the entire culture began to experience a shift that introduced new worldviews in hollywood academia and the media constant pressure from the left as well as the explosion of hedonism and selfgratification in the s and s escalated the pace of moral changein  aikman said america has undergone seven decades during which the existence of god has been repeatedly mocked or utterly dismissed on college campuses and in public schools while donald trump has never said anything about wanting to change american culture his numerous attacks on political correctness endeared him to evangelical voters after the election many christians began to think president trump might be favorable to any grassroots movement seeking to make america morally great once againpart of trumps appeal to christians of course was simply that he wasnt hillary mike bickle founder of the international house of prayer told me when it came down to trump or hillary there was no question even though trump was saying outrageous things that would have destroyed any other candidate the people loved himaikman says if hillary had been elected it would have been not only a continuation of americas lurch to the left but the doorway to a new era of corruption like nothing we have ever seen it would have made the hope of renewal and restoration many christians were praying for much harder to achieveevangelist james robison told me in a recent telephone interview a lot of christians were praying that we wouldnt lose freedom that we would not lose the opportunities this nation offers robison who serves on the presidents faith advisory board has become trumps friend and confidant and now believes his election was an answer to prayermeanwhile the secular pundits saw trumps victory as only a battle between democrat and republican or left and right but robison saw it as a supernatural spiritual battlewhat happened robison told me is that god overpowered the foolishness of political correctness and the liberal not just deceived but possessed left which is far too often deadset against a biblical worldview  but they were being totally pushed backthe secular left in this country robison said are being manipulated by powers jesus was talking about when he said of those who crucified him they dont know what theyre doing see luke  the left knew what they were doing but they were deceived by the deceiver robison saidchristians were praying god weve got to let you be god weve got to stop this nonsense robison added christians were praying for this to be stopped but they never dreamed it would be some person totally disconnected with politics totally unable to even express himself like a politician and someone who was best known as a shrewd maneuverertrump may not have handled things in the most diplomatic way robison said but he spoke with conviction about whats wrong in this countryhe was totally open about everything that was wrong most of us would agree that he didnt address those problems in the most diplomatic terms but everything he was saying was right on track he was saying that many things in this country are bad and they needed to be dealt with—and he was  percent correct steve strang is the founder of charisma media and president of christian life missions
