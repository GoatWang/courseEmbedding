corporation plan to raise money from outside investorsthe stricter formalities give investors the knowledge they desire about how your company is runplan to go public in the futureare you shooting for

ship your final package for arrival on the second business day day trial of attorney advice speak with an independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is here to

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular
