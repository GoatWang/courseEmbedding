samplingunited states patent no aug  method and apparatus for emission computed tomography using temporal signatures inventor alan c nelson an optical tomographic system is described wherein the localization of secondary emitters within an object of interest can be determined using the temporal signatures of secondary emission arising from the object being illuminated by an external primary source beam that is nonparallel such as a cone beam while said beam is moving relative to the object in a controlled manner a unique set of secondary emitter points can be localized within the object and when combined with a computed reconstruction of the object from its primary beam projections can accurately create an image of the secondary emitters in the object the system would enable the quantitative threedimensional imaging of fluorescently labeled molecular probes in a biological cell for example  claims united states patent no feb  optical projection imaging system and method for automatically detecting cells having nuclear and cytoplasmic densitometric features associated with disease inventor alan c nelson a system and method for rapidly detecting cells of interest using multidimensional highly quantitative nuclear and cytoplasmic densitometric features ndfs and cdfs includes a flow optical tomography fot instrument capable of generating various optical projection images or shadowgrams containing accurate density information from a cell a computer and software to analyze and reconstruct the projection images into a multidimensional data set and automated feature collection and object classifiers the system and method are particularly useful in the early detection of cancers such as lung cancer using a bronchial specimen from sputum or cheek scrapings and cervicalovarian cancer using a cervical scraping the system can be used to detect rare cells in specimens including blood  claims united states patent no june  optical imaging of a thick specimen inventor mark e fauver a system for optical imaging of a thick specimen that permits rapid acquisition of data necessary for tomographic reconstruction of the threedimensional d image one method involves the scanning of the focal plane of an imaging system and integrating the range of focal planes onto a detector the focal plane of an optical imaging system is scanned along the axis perpendicular to said plane through the thickness of a specimen during a single detector exposure secondly methods for reducing light scatter when using illumination point sources are presented both approaches yield shadowgrams this process is repeated from multiple perspectives either in series using a single illuminationdetection subsystem or in parallel using several illuminationdetection subsystems a set of pseudoprojections is generated which are input to a three dimensional tomographic image reconstruction algorithm united states patent no march  focal plane tracking for optical microtomography inventors mark e fauver and alan c nelson an optical tomography system comprising a light source for illuminating an object of interest with a plurality of radiation beams an object containing tube wherein when the object of interest is held within the object containing tube it is illuminated by the plurality of radiation beams to produce emerging radiation from the object containing tube an objective lens having an optical axis for scanning the object at a set of viewing angles to generate a set of pseudoprojection images from the emerging radiation where each pseudoprojection image is produced by integrating a series of images from a series of focal planes integrated along the optical axis for each angle a detector array located to receive the set of pseudoprojection images and means for tracking the object of interest responsively to the imaging data wherein the tracking means comprises means for tracking a pseudoprojection image center united

variablemotion optical tomography vot where motion of an object of interest such as a cell has a variable velocity that can be varied on a cellbycell basis cell velocity is controlled in one example by packing cells into a capillary tube or any other linear substrate so that the cells are stationary within the capillary tube but the capillary tube is translated and rotated mechanically through an optical tomography reconstruction cylinder the capillary tube motion may advantageously be controlled in a startandstop fashion and translated and rotated at any velocity for any motion interval under the control of a computer program  claims united states patent no feb  tomographic reconstruction of small objects using a priori knowledge inventor alan c nelson a system and method for threedimensional d reconstruction of a cell includes adjusting a current set of projection images according to a set of a priori knowledge to produce adjusted projection images for example based on probability masks andor bayesian analysis of multiple similar objects in the same sample a reconstruction algorithm processes the adjusted projection images to generate a d image the d image is further adjusted according to at least one set of a priori knowledge to generate an adjusted d image criteria for process completion are applied to determine whether the adjusted d image is adequate otherwise a set of pseudo projections are computationally created at the same projection angles as the current set of projection images and then compared to the current set of projection images to produce a set of new projections wherein the new projections are input again to the reconstruction algorithm and the steps of the method are repeated until the adequacy criteria are met  claims united states patent no july  optical tomography of small moving objects using time delay and integration imaging inventors cheewui chu and alan c nelson a system and method for threedimensional reconstruction of an object of interest moving at a constant velocity the object of interest is centered the object of interest is imaged with optical point sources located at multiple projection

company that has developed a revolutionary noninvasive test for the early detection of lung cancer delivered results of its blinded clinical study yesterday evening at the th world conference on lung cancer being held september   at the colorado convention center in denver colo visiongate’s blinded clinical study of the proprietary luced® test included  patients and demonstrated  sensitivity to lung cancer and  specificity “when validated in larger trials we are cautiously optimistic that this clinical performance would position luced as a lung cancer screening tool with the ability to serve populations beyond the highestrisk patients who meet cms guidelines” visiongate founder and chief executive officer alan nelson phd said more than half the people with lung cancer die within one year after being diagnosed according to the american lung association described as the “deadliest cancer worldwide” symptoms of lung cancer do not appear until the disease is already in an advanced noncurable stage spontaneously produced sputum from  patients with biopsy confirmed lung cancer and  patients who were understood to be cancer free eight of whom suffered from either copd or emphysema were included in the study the luced test generated d cell image data for blinded cytology review from this review  cancer cases were found to have abnormal cells yielding  sensitivity for the normal cases  cases had no abnormal cells for an estimated  specificity importantly this equates to a negative predictive value npv of  in a population with  incidence of lung cancer visiongate has begun to conduct largescale clinical studies to strengthen luced’s clinical evidence and is pursuing fda clearance through a national multicenter trial “the data from our blinded trial is compelling we are encouraged – now more than ever – that we are developing a costeffective solution for detecting lung cancer early” nelson said “this is a test which after validation in prospective trials will complement lung cancer screening for the diagnosis of indeterminate nodules seen on the ct scans and perhaps aid in early detection of the disease in high risk individuals” visongate’s luced test is a physicianordered noninvasive takehome test that collects sputum samples for lung cancer analysis luced harnesses the power of proprietary optics and computational technology with the capability to generate d images of each cell in a sputum sample it then automatically analyzes cells to identify key features or biosignatures associated with malignancy this approach should also enable luced to identify dysplasia and distinguishes cells as they are turning cancerous with  patents in  countries visiongate expects to play a leading role in the battle against the world’s number one cancer killer as of may  visiongate’s luced is being offered as a laboratory developed test ldt exclusively through the visiongate biosignature laboratories a clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia licensed laboratory in phoenix ariz the luced test is a diagnostic tool to help inform physician decisions regarding early lung cancer early detection “we’re excited to have commercialized luced this year” visiongate president scarlett spring said “physicians are asking for a safe easily implemented costeffective diagnostic tool to help manage false positives from ldcts we believe that luced is a component to the solution” visiongate is headquartered in phoenix with a research  development office in seattle wash for more information about visiongate visit wwwvisiongatedcom about visiongate
