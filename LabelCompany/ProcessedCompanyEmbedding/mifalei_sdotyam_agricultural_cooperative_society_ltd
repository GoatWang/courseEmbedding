matter which subject to certain exceptions is nonappealable including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the securities act and the exchange act and including a monetary or

judgment is not contrary to public policy and  the judgment is executory in the state in which it was given even if these conditions are met an israeli court will not declare a foreign civil judgment enforceable if  the judgment was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of israeli courts subject to exceptional cases  the enforcement of the judgment is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the state of israel  the judgment was obtained by fraud  the opportunity given to the defendant to bring its arguments and evidence before the court was not reasonable in the opinion of the israeli court  the judgment was rendered by a court not competent to render it according to the laws of private international law as they apply in israel  the judgment is contradictory to another judgment that was given in the same matter between the same parties and that is still valid or  at the time the action was brought in the foreign court a lawsuit in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in israel if a foreign judgment is enforced by an israeli court it generally will be payable in israeli currency which can then be converted into nonisraeli currency and transferred out of israel the usual practice in an action before an israeli court to recover an amount in a nonisraeli currency is for the israeli court to issue a judgment for the equivalent amount in israeli currency at the rate of exchange in force on the date of the judgment but the judgment debtor may make payment in foreign currency pending collection the amount of the judgment of an israeli court stated in israeli currency ordinarily will be linked to the israeli consumer price index plus interest at the annual
