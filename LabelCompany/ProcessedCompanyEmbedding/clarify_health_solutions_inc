is broken processes and inefficient workflows which results in significant waste and a poor patient experience solutions on the market today only focus on a small piece of the problem that needs to be solved — and they’re not actionable in realtime but changes in how services are billed are forcing hospitals to evolve and advances in technology have created an opportunity to reimagine the way care
