fund focused on earlystage deals but invested in a few latestage deals hoping for quicker returns they could show to limited partners while they nursed the investments in startups and it seems to be working for the menlo park fund although mixing investment strategies is a controversial trend within the industry primarily we deployed some capital in later stage companies  later being series b and c  in order to get earlier liquidity said rembrandt general partner jerry casilli the obvious basis under which we raised our capital we were going to return capital early to investors over the next few months fund managers say they will prove the strategy worked one laterstage company they invested in  semiconductor provider cavium networks  went public this year and three weeks before the investor lockout period expires the stock price has doubled another latestage rembrandt portfolio company has filed initial documents to go public and an earlierstage startup  a venture general partners initially funded with their own money before they closed the fund  is also nearing an exit now that rembrandt said it will be able to return capital to limited partners it will revert to its early stage strategy for its second fund partners say and the fund is hoping its early returns will be enough to court some large institutional investors its a strategy more early stage venture capital firms  especially those with firsttime managers  are turning to as they try and figure out how to court large institutional investors with deep pockets and tepid interest in investing in unknowns limited partners who attended the october ibf early stage venture capital investing conference in san francisco say they have mixed feelings about venture capitalists investing across rounds chris loh a vice president with gic special investments said it can work for emerging technology investors doing a couple later stage investments and showing some liquidity it gives some lps a little bit of comfort he said but robert hofeditz a partner with san francisco private equity adviser probitas partners said he doesnt want to see early stage emerging managers moving too far from their particular skill sets early stage investors following a company through later rounds is one thing but early stage investors moving into growth equity or buyout rounds might be going too far he said theres an lp term called style drift hofeditz said were taught at lp school its a bad thing ive seen people try to do things outside of their focus area and usually it doesnt turn out well when i see a vc doing buyout deals i dont think thats going to turn out too well many early stage funds do later stage deals but generally when i see someone really doing something outside of their specific area theyre getting lucky if it works out but most of the time it does not work out limited partners say they look for track record unique operational experience history with partners and other factors in determining whether or not to put money into firsttime or emerging funds many say they wont invest in new firms that dont have the track record of big returns and prefer to stick with toptier firms with long histories of investment success lriddellbizjournalscom    industries banking  financial services suggested reading featured jobs san francisco ca product marketing manager scalr stockton ca
