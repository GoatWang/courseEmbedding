nose chocolate mint evolves from the delicate peats which sit beautifully with the lesser oaky theme a comfortable yet always complex nose with the smoke soft and relaxed and refusing to bully the juicier barley taste grassy barley shows first then slowly gives way as those most gentle peat notes dissolve onto the palate and begins to build momentum and intensity again there is a chocolate mintmocha theme as well as a sublime mollassed note which injects all the sweetness required finish long helped by todiefor oils some hints of spice and now some tannins plus the vanilla but all is beautifully weighted patient and poised oh and did i mention the chocolate mint… balance  a new indian classic a sublime malt from the subcontinent to be more precise a world classic think of ardmore at its most alluring one of scotland’s finest and most complex single malts yet somehow possessing a saltiness and depth more befitting islay then stir in a small degree of ulmo honey and bourbonstyle hickory and liquorice plus subtle chocolate mint and there you have it…the smoke drifting around stirring up spicy tales of the east a world class whisky to be talked about with reverence without
