despite moving a proposed tailings pond to avoid impacts on fish lake tasekos new prosperity mine project was rejected by the federal government  biv archives the vancouver mining company that’s suing the federal government for rejecting the new prosperity copper mine and tried unsuccessfully to sue the wilderness committee for defamation is now fighting another legal battle in the us taseko mines ltd tsxtko nyse mkt tgb is embroiled in a nasty proxy battle with a dissident shareholder group that wants to elect four of its own members to taseko’s board of directors ostensibly to conduct a housecleaning in january a group of shareholders collectively known as raging river capital lp acquired  of taseko’s common shares and demanded a shareholder vote on february  taseko filed a complaint in us district court alleging violations of securities and exchange commission regulations by raging river taseko claims raging river failed to disclose that in addition to its  equity stake in taseko it owns  million in bond debt that’s important said taseko investor relations vicepresident brian bergot because raging river directors could vote to sell taseko assets to improve the value of their own bonds while negatively affecting the share price “any reduction in our corporate debt improves the value of our bonds” bergot said “as a bond holder and with seats on the board this parternship – raging river nominees – could take certain action to liquidate taseko assets which they stated they would do and that could have very bad consequences for shareholders” raging river meanwhile has sent a letter to the bc securities commission seeking an investigation into what it alleges is insider trading on the part of two taseko executives taseko responded to those allegations march  with a lawyer’s letter to raging river managing partner mark radzik demanding a retraction and apology and threatening a defamation suit radzik shrugs off the threat saying it’s just a distraction from legitimate concerns shareholders have about the company’s performance which includes a  loss in market cap since the beginning of  “they get mad they lose they sue everyone” he told business in vancouver “that’s what they do” in  its letter to radzik taseko denies raging river’s allegation that taseko ceo russell hallbauer and company vicepresident of corporate affairs brian battison had bought taseko stock between january  and january  “while in possession of nonpublic material information” the information in question was a  million credit facility with an affiliate of rk mine finance red kite that taseko announced on february  in its letter to radzik taseko disputes the claim that hallbauer and battison knew that the deal would be done “in particular the shares were acquired by our clients well before the credit agreement with red kite was entered into and at a time when it was not known whether the transaction would proceed or not” the letter states among its other complaints raging river questions the “conflicted” relationship between taseko and hunter dickinson inc hdi a private mining house whose board of directors includes hallbauer and two other taseko directors according to raging river hunter dickinson has received  million from taseko in fees and investments since   raging river is focusing on a relationship which we have with hunter dickinson which is a very beneficial relationship to taseko bergot said they provide cost effective services from highquality individuals professionals they are trying to make something out of conflict which does not exist raging river also questions taseko’s friendly acquisition in  of exploration company curis resources ltd hallbauer and two other directors were curis shareholders holding  of the company’s stock according to taseko radzik said it was a bad deal for shareholders “that’s a deal they paid almost  million for and the company was almost bankrupt” he said curis had three directors in common with taseko “they were completely recused from the entire process bergot said so they had no say” he said an independent committee was struck to evaluate the friendly acquisition mickey fulp publisher of the mercenary geologist was a curis shareholder and through the transaction became a taseko shareholder he doesn’t share raging river’s view that there is an inherent conflict of interest between taseko and hdi fulp has criticized such arrangements in the past with junior mining companies he has for example questioned the practice of ceos of junior exploration companies hiring their own drilling companies but fulp said hdi and taseko are both “real companies” and he doesn’t have a problem with the arrangement “that said they hdi have a reputation of being a highcost outfit” fulp added in a pressrelease response to some of raging river’s questions about its relationship with hdi the company said it conducts regular reviews of the mining services hdi provides and compares its rates with those of other companies “taseko is satisfied the rates are competitive with if not lower than other suppliers of similar services” it said as a shareholder fulp’s biggest beef with taseko was its acquisition of curis “i was not happy with the terms of that takeover” fulp said radzik said there are a lot of shareholders who are unhappy and that they want to see a change in taseko’s direction and governance he characterizes taseko management and directors as being overly litigious and confrontational citing the new prosperity project as an example the tsilhqot’in first nation vigorously opposed the project over concerns that the area’s fish lake would be drained in order to build a tailings pond two iterations of the mine project were rejected by the federal government taseko responded by filing for judicial review it later asked the federal court to convert that application to a lawsuit against the federal government the court rejected the second application to convert to a lawsuit but allowed the judicial review to proceed just last week taseko filed suit against the attorney general of canada and canadian environmental assessment agency over their rejection of the new prosperity mine project taseko also tried to sue the wilderness committee for defamation over public criticisms it made about the new prosperity project in january the bc supreme court dismissed the defamation suit against the wilderness committee and awarded the environmental organization court costs taseko responded by filing an appeal of the court’s dismissal of the defamation suit should raging river succeed in replacing some of taseko’s directors with its own designates radzik said he would hope to see a different approach he thinks the only way the new prosperity project could go forward is if the company changes its attitude towards the tsilhqot’in “the first thing we would do is try to reengage the first nation and rebuild trust and try to start over again” he said to address concerns about hdi taseko said it will add two new independent directors to the board and will change governance policies to give shareholders greater say on the relationship with hdi a taseko shareholder meeting has been scheduled for may  but between now and then the war of words between raging river and taseko appears unlikely to abate taseko has told shareholders via a press release that raging river may have misled them when it failed to disclose that radzik had at one time been a director for an american company that had gone bankrupt in a press release naming four nominees for director positions including radzik raging river stated that “to the knowledge of raging river” none of the four nominees were a director or chief executive or financial officer for a company that had been subject to cease trade orders or bankruptcy proceedings taseko points out in a february   press release that radzik had been a director for a us company support plus medical which went bankrupt in  “the bankruptcy involves troubling circumstances that illustrate the danger of corporate directors who are also lenders” taseko said in its press release

mudslinging and attempts to distract from shareholder concerns at the company raging river is commencing a defamation lawsuit  sudden resignation of director george ireland underscores serious shareholder concerns about what exactly is going on at the board level raging river capital lp raging river owning approximately  of the outstanding common shares of taseko mines limited tsx tkonyse mkt tgb taseko has said enough is enough in response to tasekos continued attempts to distract from the problems of the company and is commencing a defamation lawsuit with the objective of elevating the tenor of the debate to focus on the real issues of taseko by trying to portray mark radzik managing partner of raging river in a negative and baseless fashion taseko is continuing its well established strategy of fingerpointing and mudslinging it is clear this is yet another attempt to avoid scrutiny on very clear conflicts of interest and destruction of shareholder value most recently shown through a lawsuit against the canadian government and a losing suit against the wilderness committee i expect taseko will eventually and desperately use the fact i once lost money on a lemonade stand venture when i was six as an excuse for why their conflicted and selfinterested directors should not be replaced said mr radzik no amount of mudslinging will change our view that the hunter dickinson related directors have gotten rich at the expense of taseko shareholders and no amount of attempted distraction can erase their value destruction today we say enough is enough we wont be bullied and we wont back down we are fighting back to ensure we can bring the change to taseko that shareholders want shareholders havent been fooled by tasekos campaign of mass distraction as raging river has received overwhelming expressions of support from taskeo shareholders including vertex one owning  of issued and outstanding shares endorsing the replacement of incumbent directors ronald thiessen russell hallbauer and robert dickinson with raging rivers independent nominees paul blythe randy davenport henry park and mark radzik raging river asks shareholders to consider the facts related to certain directors affiliated with hunter dickinson hunter dickinson affiliated directors have a disproportionate say in taseko decisions hunter dickinson is a privately owned mining group with significant influence on taseko hunter dickinson executives hold three board positions at taseko including the chairman ronald w thiessen and the ceo russell hallbauer and yet these directors own just  of taseko hunter dickinson related entities have received  million from taseko since  total fees and investment paid to hunter dickinson related entities totals  million in addition hunter dickinson related entities have received from curis resources ltd curis unusually high management and service fees of us million over the  and  curis fiscal years during which time taseko invested  million in curis this means more than half of the money taseko invested in curis has been paid back to hunter dickinson related entities in fees taseko bought hunter dickinson related company curis while on the verge of bankruptcy hunter dickinson and related parties owned  of curis curis was on the verge of bankruptcy with only k of cash and  million of expensive  debt due in  despite injecting  million in the first quarter taseko acquired curis in november  at a premium  above the day vwap for a company about to go bankrupt and ensured the acquisition price was just below the threshold that would require shareholder approval not everyone has access to a company like taseko to bail out a company going bankrupt like curis advisors raging river has engaged norton rose fulbright canada llp

have led taseko into multiple relatedparty transactions with no proven upside to shareholder value  taseko has underperformed relative to its peers over the short medium and long term  shareholders lack confidence in members of the board and trading is at a discount to taseko peers  raging rivers nominees are highly qualified have a track record of value creation and will refocus the company on its core assets to increase shareholder value and align directors interests with all shareholders raging river capital lp raging river owning approximately   of the outstanding common shares of taseko mines limited taseko announced today it has requisitioned the taseko board of directors to call a meeting of shareholders for the purposes of among other things reconstituting the board with the removal of three incumbent directors and the election of four new independent directors the new independent directors nominees would constitute a minority of the board we believe taseko has underperformed relative to its peers and that certain members of the incumbent board are conflicted the three directors that should be removed stand to benefit from the collection of significant fees and the use of tasekos valuable cash reserves for their own personal interest we believe making preferential related party deals in a difficult macro cycle further destroys shareholder value said mark radzik managing partner of raging river taseko shareholders deserve better its time for a taseko shareholders can trust the leaders of this company need to focus on operating its core business and reestablishing credibility with its investors and improving share performance our independent and highly qualified director nominees will bring about positive change to create value for all shareholders the case for change it is clear to raging river that the interests of certain members of the current board are not aligned with those of taseko shareholders given their relationship with

act responsibly in the period before the requisitioned meeting the meeting raging river announced last week that it had requisitioned the taseko board of directors to call a meeting of shareholders for the purposes of among other things reconstituting the board with the removal of three incumbent directors and the election of four new independent directors the early indications of support we have received from shareholders who have contacted us underscores the need for change on an expedited basis the longer the current taseko board goes without addressing the ongoing conflicts of interest the more shareholder value is at risk of being destroyed on behalf of all shareholders we urge the board to call and hold the requisitioned meeting promptly said mark radzik managing partner of raging river we also remind the board of their fiduciary duty and obligation to act in the best interests of the company and all shareholders it is time for a taseko board that shareholders trust
