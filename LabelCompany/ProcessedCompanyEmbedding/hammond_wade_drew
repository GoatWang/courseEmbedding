a democrat hammond was perhaps best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of slavery and states rights he popularized the phrase that cotton is king in his march   speech to the us senate saying “in all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties to perform the drudgery of life    it constitutes the very mudsill of society” he went on to utter the oftrepeated words “you dare not make war on cotton — no power on earth dares make war upon it cotton is king” in his writings he consistently compared the souths well compensated slaves to the free labor of the north describing the latter as scantily compensated slaves as he termed the hired skilled laborers and operatives going beyond articles in local newspapers he coauthored the proslavery argument with william harper thomas roderick dew and william gilmore simms hammond and simms were part of a sacred circle of intellectuals including edmund ruffin nathaniel beverley tucker and george frederick holmes who promoted reformation in the south in various forms as supporters of slavery they both justified it in terms of stewardship of inferior beings and promoted slaveholders improvement of their treatment of slaves hammond promoted redcliffe his plantation in beech island south carolina as his ideal of the perfectly run plantation in his plantation manual  it includes a wide range of material with detailed rules regulating treatment of pregnant and nursing slaves whom he allowed to nurse their infants for  months old slaves no longer fit for heavy field work together with rules about clothing quarters food etc in addition to livestock and crop management sexualityedit in the late th century historians learned that hammond as a young man had a homosexual relationship with a college friend thomas jefferson withers which is attested by two sexually explicit letters sent from withers to hammond in  the letters which are held among the hammond papers at the south carolina library were

ann fitzsimmons and her husband wade hampton ii he blamed his behavior on what he described as the seductiveness of the “extremely affectionate” young women the scandal derailed his political career for a decade to come after wade hampton iii publicly accused him in  when hammond was governor he was ostracized by polite society for some time but in the late s he was nonetheless elected by the state legislature as us senator hammonds damage to the girls was farreaching their social prospects were destroyed considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior none of the four ever married hammond was also known to have had longterm sexual relationships with two female slaves one of whom was his own daughter he took the first slave sally johnson as a concubine when she was  years old such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time their mixedrace children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them later hammond took sally johnsons daughter louisa who was a year old baby when he bought his mother as a concubine when the girl was  she also bore several of his children his wife left him for a few years after he began the relationship with the slave girl taking their own children with her she later returned to her husband legacyedit hammond school in columbia south carolina was originally named after

hammond and the old south a design for mastery  by drew gilpin faust  baton rouge louisiana state university press                contradictions defined the life of south carolina’s james henry hammond  hammond – rose from common roots to become a critic of social mobility  the son of a schoolmaster from new england hammond became an ardent defender of slavery and the old south’s hierarchical society  perpetually concerned with selfcontrol hammond found himself lacking confidence and wrecked his political ambitions with a sex scandal  drew gilpin faust explores these fallacies and more in james henry hammond and the old south  faust now president of harvard university drew heavily upon hammond’s papers for her second book  the biography won the jules f landry award for   the prize is given to the most outstanding southern study published by louisiana state university press faust divides the book into five parts and follows the chronology of hammond’s life from his youth marriage and plantation management his early political career his intellectual career and his final political deeds and death  hammond was the eldest child and son of an educator from massachusetts and a south carolina woman from modest means  his upcountry family owned few slaves but hammond’s father elisha hammond instilled a ferocious ambition in his son  elisha hammond forced the young hammond to exercise constant and unremitting selfcontrol  he compelled the boy to pursue education and warned him to respect the state’s slaveholding aristocracy  his father’s tutelage allowed hammond to enter south carolina college as a junior  there as a senior he heard a professor articulate the emerging conservative social thought that would come to dominate the southern mind  hammond’s twoyear college career followed the model established by his father  he excelled in his studies and led an oratory club  graduation however unleashed insecurity  hammond wandered around the state from jobtojob and worked as a tutor and schoolteacher   his domineering father’s fortunes failed and he relied on hammond for support  hammond struggled to balance his father’s expectations with his own lust for flirtatious women  hammond settled into the study of law opened his own practice in columbia and during the  nullification crisis controlled a leading nullifier newspaper hammond’s social and financial fortunes improved when he married charleston heiress catherine fitzsimons  hammond gained control of her family’s plantation silver bluff and its large slave population  hammond embraced his new membership in the planter class and ironically given his station as a child derided social and political mobility  hammond argued that the elites should be concerned with the welfare of the lower classes just as a planter cared for his slaves  hammond’s talk of masters showing a paternal interest in their slaves did not match his actions  he implemented progressive farming techniques at silver bluff that enhanced his wealth and devastated his slaves  he exercised strict control over the lives of his slaves  he forbid black preachers and prohibited religious gatherings  hammond insisted on naming slave children  ironically he fathered slave children and his wife temporarily abandoned their marriage hammond parlayed the notoriety he gained during the nullification crisis and his new social standing into one unremarkable term in the us house of representatives –  in congress he declared slavery a positive good and southern slavery as a model for society  his term as governor – ended with disgrace as wade hampton ii the husband of catherine hammond’s older sister accused hammond of seducing his four teenage daughters  the scandal threatened to destroy hammond’s political career hammond saw himself as the political heir of john c calhoun  his reputation still in ruins hammond failed to win calhoun’s seat after the senator’s death in   hammond retired to his plantation sulked and tried to express his intellect in writing  relief came with his election to the us senate on the eve of the civil war  his term like his time as congressman and governor was short and unexceptional  his single speech came in  surrounding the controversy over the admission of kansas with the proslavery lecompton constitution  hammond spoke of southern superiority and the old south’s leadership of the nascent united states  he bragged about his region’s social economic and military strength   the north would regret a war with the south  “no” hammond declared “you dare not make war on cotton  no power on earth dares make war on it  cotton is king” p   hammond resigned from the senate with south carolina seceded             a man obsessed with control hammond failed to keep one brother from becoming a drunk and another from serving as a surgeon in the union army  hammond died with sherman’s troops marching triumphantly toward south carolina  hammond provides his biographer with plenty of material  faust tells his outrageous story with helpful explanations and careful analysis texas christian university                                                   jeff wells                      james henry hammond and the old south a design for mastery by drew gilpin faust baton  rouge louisiana state university press  james henry hammond emerged from relative poverty to become one of the most prominent politicians in south carolina in the early nineteenth century drew gilpin faust’s biography james henry hammond and the old south examines his life and career in an era of sectional tensions as he fought to defend the southern way of life hammond served in a variety of political positions being elected to the united states house of representatives the governor’s office and the senate on the eve of the civil war though committed to republican ideals hammond supported the secession of south carolina as a means to protect the institution of slavery and southern society hammond entered the aristocratic plantation society with his marriage to catherine fitzsimons who inherited a plantation at silver bluff though his family had owned a handful slaves periodically during his childhood for the first time hammond found himself in the position of managing a large number of slaves he thought of himself as a “beneficent master whose guidance and control represented the best of all possible worlds for the uncivilized and backward people entrusted to him by god”  though in reality he sought to dominate and control every aspect of his slaves’ lives he eliminated preaching by slaves and religious congregations within the slave community hammond also altered the labor system of his plantation in order to reduce recreational time for the slaves and increase efficiency he took even the most basic choices away from his slaves  by naming their children hammond fathered children by some of his slaves but believed freeing them would be cruelty instead he instructed his legitimate son to keep them as slaves in the family and not to make them slaves of strangers although he married into the plantation society hammond wholly adopted the lifestyle and ideology of a southern gentleman he recognized that plantations became “little kingdoms” and understood that owning a plantation and slaves advanced his social status and political ambitions    a supporter of both states’ rights and slavery hammond used the nullification crisis to propel himself into the house of representatives once elected he delivered the first congressional defense of slavery as a “positive good” while a staunch supporter of the southern institution hammond always felt himself an outside in society once elected governor of south carolina his brotherinlaw wade hampton ii played on these fears in retaliation for hammond’s sexual indiscretions with his four daughters after discovering the affair hampton succeeded in alienating hammond from aristocratic society unfortunately by airing the scandal hampton ensured his daughters would remain unmarried for the rest of their lives as a senator on the eve of the civil war hammond continued to advocate the southern way of life he felt that the south’s social and economic institutions largely built on slavery proved themselves superior to those in the north he warned the north not to make war on the south as southern cotton production had become a worldwide economic staple he believed that the labor system that produced cotton namely slavery ensured the humane treatment of workers which the free labor system in the north did not in hammond the south found a rallying point hammond died in november of  shortly before the end of the civil war he clung to the southern way of life until the very end calling slave children to his bed to sing spirituals rather than acknowledge the impending failure of the south hammond chose to remain fully committed to slavery faust’s biography is well researched and she presents an honest portrayal of hammond he proved a man of contradictions believing in the republic but still championing the south he rose to the top of southern society yet always felt himself an outsider hammond is not portrayed a hero of the south rather faust creates a tragic figure with few redeeming qualities the author relies on hammond’s personal papers to great effect hammond comes to represent the south’s total commitment to slavery even to the point of accepting obvious moral and philosophical contradictions misty wilson texas christian university   drew gilpin faust  james henry hammond and the old south a design for mastery  baton rouge louisiana state university press         in  drew gilpin faust produced a biography of prominent south carolina politician and planter james henry hammond hammond throughout the antebellum period staunchly defended southern society and slavery  the south carolinian believed that a system based upon deference and bonded labor offered an ideal model for other societies  hammond was even ready to endorse secession when the election of the republican abraham lincoln in the minds of many southerners threatened the peculiar institution  faust though notes numerous contradictions that existed throughout hammond’s life  while hammond was one of the foremost spokesmen for the south he increasingly felt alienated from certain aspects central to the region’s society  the author stresses these contradictions throughout her narrative        faust spends the first part of her book detailing the early years of hammond’s life  the prominent southern politician began his life as the son of a middle class educator  elisha hammond james’s father put immense pressure on his son to succeed in both school and life  the younger hammond a byproduct of antebellum south carolina accepted the aristocratic society and slave culture of the state  his positions only hardened when he entered planter society through his marriage to the charleston heiress catherine fitzsimons        this union allowed hammond to live the life of a powerful south carolinian planter  the planter class like in all other states of the old south dominated almost all political and social leadership positions  hammond became one of the strongest advocates of the position of south carolina’s elites  he decried the increasing social and political mobility emerging in the state  this was despite the fact that hammond himself was a product of this process of upward mobility         faust also delves into hammond’s views on slavery  she spends several illuminating chapters on life at silver bluff hammond’s south carolina plantation  faust describes how hammond’s view on relationships between masters and slaves crystallized  hammond like many southern planters saw themselves as paternal figures looking out after the interests of their slaves  these planters saw their charges as children who needed the firm but guiding hand of the master  in addition the institution was a positive good that brought structure to african americans  by extension hammond thought that the plantation and its patriarchal structure offered the ideal model for how social relations should be structured  a social order based upon the planter elites looking out for the welfare of the lower classes        nevertheless while hammond became one of the most vocal supporters of the old south he also felt like an outsider hammond because of his education considered himself an intellectual  hammond’s self described intellectualism set him apart from most southerners  his enhanced feelings of exceptionalism led hammond to enjoy the company of other alienated southerners like william gilmore simms  hammond and simms both decried the lack of respect that the old south possessed for the life of the mind        faust’s biography is well written and accessible  the author also used hammond’s personal papers to produce an interesting and illuminating portrait of the planter politician  in addition the author portrays hammond as a deeply troubled man with her discussion of the south carolinian’s incestuous relationship with his nieces in all faust produces a fine study of the life and career of this influential southerner robert h butts   faust drew gilpin  james henry hammond and the old south  a design for mastery baton rouge la  louisiana state university press  throughout history many people have sought to gain immense power and stooped to all levels to gain it james henry hammond is a good example of this type of motivation and drew gilpin faust tells his story in her book james henry hammond and the old south in her book faust not only examines the life of hammond but also explores the old south on many different levels  though this is not a comprehensive study of the south it does highlight many different aspects of its past from relationships between master and slave to the life of a prominent politician all these aspects present themselves in the life of a man driven by ambition to be the most prominent and influential person in the south before the civil war hammond came from a modest background that spurred him to become a very ambitious person with the ultimate goal of ruling the south  his first step toward mastery of the south was at south carolina college when he received several honors for his oratory skills and became friends with many prominent men of the south  the next step he achieved towards prominence came when he married into a wealthy family that gave him a large plot of land and slaves  with a plantation he no longer had to worry about supporting himself and began to focus his energies on politics hammond entered south carolina politics at the right moment to start an outstanding political career during the nullification crisis  the nullification crisis gave him a platform to speak about states’ rights  in the process he ran and got elected to the house of representatives  as a freshman representative he quickly became well known throughout washington dc for making a definitive stand against any possible move by the federal government to rule against the permanency of slavery  as quickly as this gave him a name poor health forced him out of politics  to recover hammond and his wife toured europe for fifteen months which reinforced his belief in slavery because of the number of impoverished he saw  when he returned to south carolina he openly challenged john c calhoun in an attempt to dethrone him from the major leadership role of the south and failed for the remainder of his life he continued his quest of becoming the leader of the south  after a failed term as governor spending thirteen years as part of an elite academic group that attempted to design a way to develop the economy of the south while maintaining its social structure and trying to replace calhoun at his death by adopting his ideals hammond was no closer to his goal than when he started  his last chance came when he unexpectedly won a seat in the senate without putting his name on the ballot  he again won fame but could not hold onto it for long since his ideas proved too moderate compared to the younger southern politicians that pushed for secession  with his last chance at prominence gone he retired to his plantation  in the end hammond represented the old south in his beliefs and actions  when the old south was disappearing during the civil war his life did also  the only thing hammond had to show for his life of pure ambition was a fractured and broken family in the year that faust published this book he received the jules f landry award for his work  the book represents the award rightfully  faust does an excellent job of not only telling the story of hammond’s life but also placing it into context and examining how the south functioned during the time period  the author does this in a subtle manner which allows the reader to follow hammond’s life without interrupting the flow of the book by pointing out direct parallels  in addition faust does not commit a common error among biographers resorting to hero worship  he does a great job presenting all sides of the story even those aspects that seem damaging to hammond’s name like his frolicking with his nieces marrying his wife for money and prestige and his hypochondriac nature  lastly the author includes several charts and graphs in the appendix of the book that clarify some of the information he presented in the body of the book if there are any criticisms of the book it is the lack of a bibliography  faust makes up for this mistake with a short bibliographical essay on the sources that he used  overall i found this to be an excellent book  i would recommend this book for both undergraduate and graduate courses on the old south and the civil war charles grear james henry hammond and the old south a design for mastery by drew gilpin faust baton rouge louisiana state university press   xvii    the life of james henry hammond provides drew gilpin faust with a unique opportunity  hammond’s complexity and multiple achievements enables the author to delve into many facets of southern antebellum society and thought through the life of his subject  hammond typifies the aristocratic southern plantation owner owning a plantation with hundreds of slaves  his membership in a privileged class extended to participation in government serving successively as a congressman governor and senator of north carolina  faust’s subject gave the famous “cotton is king” speech in the u s senate and in addition to writing a well received defense of slavery also served as a general in the militia and was also an influential agricultural reformer  given the complexity of his subject faust could have been content to merely tell his story which he does to great satisfaction  instead faust finds in hammond’s perplexing combinations of career an underlying and unifying theme present throughout his life  hammond’s “design for mastery”  all of hammond’s endeavors in faust’s estimation revolve around the question of power and domination  aside from the obvious example of his participation in the slave system faust finds this theme present in hammond’s relations with his poor white neighbors his wife and his mother and even the foreign servants serving him during trips abroad  hammond’s experiences led him to remark “i only succeed when everything is under my control” and hammond “sought obedience” from others in every facet and in every social situation in which he found himself throughout his life  whether from his own mother who felt obligated to circumvent his wishes through a secret will from his slaves whom he beat and tried to destroy their religion or from his “equals” in government whom he also tried to dominate and control in all matters  power and domination also extended to his involvement in illicit relationships  affairs with slave mistresses may have been common and hammond engaged in them constantly  less common was his liaison with his four nieces ages twelve to seventeen at the beginning with him he engaged in “an extraordinary petting orgy” over a period of years  in looking at this theme of power and domination faust constructs in a sense a kind of “psychohistory” of hammond  not explicitly freudian faust finds her subject craving through domination “a need for love ”  while faust does not delve into the language of any particular school of thought psychologically she is almost obligated to deal with these issues having identified them as a unifying theme the implications of faust’s theme naturally extends to the results of hammond’s attempts at domination and she finds unequivocally that he failed miserably  his attempts to destroy his slaves independent church failed as did his total regulation of their lives slaves ran away stole food and sabotaged his control over them in numerous other ways his marriage floundered through his affairs and his wife left him several times due to his refusal to give up his plantation mistresses having fathered children by both a mother and her daughter  politically he could never fully dominate his fellows and his advocation of conciliation during the time of secession gained him isolation rather than the domination he sought  his affair with his nieces left him in a sort of political “exile” which lasted nearly sixteen years his coldness and impossible demands on his sons led to threats on his part to disinherit them discovering all of these failures faust draws as her controversial conclusion that masters through participation in the slave system must themselves also lead a life of dependence and domination hammond like all masters was also a slave and ultimately it killed him  his driving desire to dominate extended to control of his bowels which he attempted to control through the ingestion of mercurybased laxatives that eventually poisoned him kenneth greenbert faust’s reviewers points out that her theme “first and best stated by hegal” also informed the writings of david b davis and eugene genovese kenneth greenberg reviews in history sept    attempts to of one human being to dominate another always end in failure hammond’s slaves molded hammond as much as he molded them  his wife determined the effects of his excesses with his mistresses not hammond wade hampton’s threats to expose his tryst with his nieces determined the course of his political career in all of this it is hard to see hammond’s excesses as representing any sort of need for love  another reviewer states “to call the furies that drove hammond a need for love seems to domesticate them beyond belief michael p johnson journal of southern history nov    while one may disagree with the reasons and psychological conclusions one draws from faust’s portrait of hammond she provides a compelling and important portrait and narrative of a complex individual driven by power and the paradox posed by his experience
