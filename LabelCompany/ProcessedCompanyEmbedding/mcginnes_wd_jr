district court for the western district of texas before goldberg jolly and barksdale circuit judges barksdale circuit judge charles and laura walden appeal from the denial by the bankruptcy and district courts of their claimed exemption for an annuity pursuant to texinscode art  we reverse and render judgment allowing the exemption prior to  charles walden jr was employed in his familys funeral business consisting of cookwalden funeral homes a partnership owning funeral homes and capital parks inc a corporation owning a cemetery  in december  golden era services inc ges purchased the assets of the partnership and corporation in connection with that purchase ges entered into employment agreements and noncompetition agreements with three key employees walden waldens father and hortense fisher  waldens employment contract was for a period of ten years in an executive capacity but the noncompetition agreement was for a period of  years under the latter he was to receive  per month for  months secured by mortgage liens on the funeral home land and buildings and a lien on the name cookwalden funeral homes pursuant to the employment agreement walden began working for ges on december   but in october of the next year he was placed on an indefinite leave of absence and ges ceased making payments to him under the noncompetition agreement  walden his father and fisher sued ges in state court claiming breaches of the employment and noncompetition agreements the suit was settled in  with the parties entering into a settlement agreement that april that agreement provided that noncompetition payments would recommence that walden would resign from his executive position effective retroactively to october   and that the noncompetition agreements would be amended to provide that ges could substitute an annuity for the liens securing its obligations under those agreements  accordingly the noncompetition agreement was then so amended april  neither the settlement agreement nor the amendment to the noncompetition agreement required ges to purchase annuities for walden or the other two key employees nor did ges purchase annuities when the settlement was finalized in april  in october of that year however ges purchased annuities for the three key employees thereby obtaining the release of all of the collateral securing its obligations under the noncompetition agreements walden and his wife filed a bankruptcy petition in september  they listed the annuity with principal life insurance company as an asset and claimed it as exempt the exemption was claimed under article  of the texas insurance code which allows an exemption for inter alia benefits received under any plan or program of annuities and benefits in use by any employer texinscode art  west supp the trustee objected to the exemption the bankruptcy court sustained the objection holding that the annuity did not qualify as exempt property because inter alia it did not represent a plan or program of annuities and benefits in use by any employer in that it was purchased in connection with the settlement of litigation and ges was not waldens employer at the time of purchase in re walden  br   bankrwd tex  after reviewing the record the district court affirmed without rendering an opinion we review the bankruptcy courts findings of fact for clear error but review freely questions of law bankruptcy rule  matter of herbys foods inc  fd   th cir  the relevant facts are not in dispute the sole issue is one of law a question of statutory interpretation whether the annuity qualifies as exempt property under art  the parties have not cited nor have we found any texas cases interpreting the provisions of art  in a context analogous to the one at hand nevertheless we are given more than firm guidance in our interpretation by the texas courts longstanding admonition that exemption statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the claimant the texas supreme court has stated that our exemption laws should be liberally construed in favor of express exemptions and should never be restricted in their meaning and effect so as to minimize their operation upon the beneficent objects of the statutes without doubt the exemption would generally be resolved in favor of the claimant hickman v hickman  tex   swd    quoting carson v mcfarland  swd   texcivappsan antonio  writ refd   the bankruptcy code provides that when a bankruptcy case is commenced all property in which the debtor has a legal or equitable interest becomes property of the bankruptcy estate  usc §  but that debtors may exempt certain property from the claims of creditors  usc §  depending on state law debtors may claim either the federal exemptions enumerated in  usc § d or those available under applicable state or local law matter of volpe  fd   th cir  texas debtors may elect either the state or federal exemptions id the waldens elected the texas exemptions among those available under texas law is art  entitled unlimited exemption of insurance benefits from seizure under process which provides in pertinent part sec  notwithstanding any provision of this code other than this article all money or benefits of any kind  to be paid or rendered to the insured or any beneficiary under any policy of insurance issued by a life health or accident insurance company  or under any plan or program of annuities and benefits in use by any employer shall  inure exclusively to the benefit of the person for whose use and benefit the insurance is designated in the policy  be fully exempt from execution attachment garnishment or other process  be fully exempt from being seized taken or appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable process or operation of law to pay any debt or liability of the insured or of any beneficiary either before or after said money or benefits is or are paid or rendered and  be fully exempt from all demands in any bankruptcy proceeding of the insured or beneficiary emphasis added  as stated the waldens claimed that the annuity payments were exempt under art   the trustee claims that the annuity was created pursuant to settlement of litigation and was therefore not a true annuity under matter of young  fd  th cir  the debtor in young was an attorney who had represented the plaintiffs in a death claim id at  pursuant to a structured settlement of that litigation the debtor attorney was to receive monthly payments from an annuity contract as attorneys fees id at  the debtor claimed that the annuity was exempt under louisiana law  id at  our court noted that while the payments were strictly speaking an annuity they also were accounts receivable accordingly it pierce d the veil of th e arrangement to determine its true nature id at  because  it is the substance of the arrangement rather than the label affixed to it that determines whether the payments are exempt under the louisiana statutes as proceeds from an annuity or accounts receivable and part of the bankruptcy estate id at  the funds that made up the principal of the annuity were part of the payment the debtor was entitled to receive as attorneys fees for services rendered but the debtor elected to receive the fees in regular monthly payments over a year period rather than in a lump sum accordingly our court concluded that the annuity payments represented nothing more than installment payments on the debt owed to the debtor for attorneys fees id because the debtor retained a right against the purchaser of the annuity for the remaining principal owed until the debt for his attorneys fees was paid in full our court held that in substance the annuity was nothing more than an account receivable and not exempt from the bankruptcy estate id at  young is distinguishable in several respects the most obvious distinction is that it dealt with louisiana not texas exemption statutes here as noted our interpretation is governed by texas wellsettled policy of liberal construction the litigation that was settled arose out of the employment relationship between ges and walden including gess alleged breach of the noncompetition agreement and most important the annuity payments claimed to be exempt are not accounts receivable for services already performed by walden rather the annuity was purchased by ges for the purpose of obtaining a release of the liens securing its continuing future obligationas well as to fund that obligationto pay walden  per month in exchange for his continued future compliance with his agreement not to compete  we conclude therefore that the settlement agreement which resolved waldens lawsuit against ges and authorized ges to substitute an annuity for the collateral securing its continuing obligation under the noncompetition agreement does not preclude the annuity from being exempt under art  although the substitution of the annuity for the collateral was made possible by the settlement agreement the annuity payments represent gess obligations under the preexisting noncompetition agreement the validity of which was simply reaffirmed by the settlement agreement as stated waldens resignation was effective october   the annuity was not purchased until october  after the employment relationship had ended the bankruptcy court held that because there was no employment relationship between ges and walden at the time of purchase the annuity was not in use by an employer as required by art  this analysis overlooks the fact that the annuity payments represent gess obligations under the noncompetition agreement which was entered into at the inception of waldens employment with ges and the validity of which was reaffirmed by the settlement agreement under texas law a noncompetition agreement is valid only if it is ancillary to another relationship or transaction reasonable and supported by consideration chenault v otis engineering corp  swd   texcivapp writ refd nre waldens employment relationship with ges is the only relationship to which the noncompetition agreement can be ancillary the termination of waldens employment relationship with ges was deemed to have been effective on october   only because the parties agreed to that through the settlement in  when that agreement was executed in april  walden was on an indefinite leave of absence prior to execution of the settlement agreement and amendment of the noncompetition agreement required by the settlement ges had no right to substitute an annuity for the collateral securing its obligations under the noncompetition agreement as noted when ges obtained that right through the april  settlement walden was still on indefinite leave of absence from his employment with ges therefore the parties april  agreement to treat waldens employment with ges as having terminated on october   and the fact that ges waited until october  to purchase the annuity cannot change the fact that the annuity payments represent ges obligations to make monthly payments to walden under the noncompetition agreement which was ancillary to his employment with ges see chenault  swd at  a covenant not to compete was ancillary to employment even though it was executed at the time of termination of employment and after the employee had gone to work for another employer as a result we conclude that ges purchased the annuity in its capacity as waldens employer thus satisfying art s requirement that the annuity be in use by an employer finally the trustee asserts that the annuity is not covered by art  because it is not part of a plan or program of annuities and benefits again we disagree as noted we must give a broad interpretation to the language of art  blacks law dictionary th ed  defines plan as among other things a method of design or action procedure or arrangement for accomplishment of a particular act or object likewise program is defined as a plan or system under which action may be taken toward a goal websters ninth new collegiate dictionary   waldens annuity is one of three purchased by ges in order to arrange for the accomplishment of a particular object or goal funding the continuingfuture noncompetition payments and securing the release of its assets from the liens held by walden and the other two key employees as collateral for those payments article  covers any  plan or program of annuities and benefits in use by an employer accordingly it is not necessary that the plan or program provide annuities for all employees or that it be of longstanding duration or that it be of a particular type such as for retirement  see hime v city of galveston  swd   texcivappwaco  writ refd nre emphasis in original  particularly in construing statutes the word any is equivalent to and has the same force of every and all  in short gess provision of annuities to only three former employees does not make it any less a plan or a program within the meaning of art  interpreting the statute liberally as texas law requires we are more than satisfied that the annuity is part of a requisite plan or program of annuities and benefits our interpretation is bolstered by other considerations the waldens assert persuasively that equity requires exemption of the annuity because had ges not purchased it the postpetition noncompetition payments would not have been property of the bankruptcy estate under  usc § a  which provides that earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case are not property of the estate  see in re hammond  br  bankrwd okla  holding that because future noncompetition payments were conditioned on the debtors compliance with the covenant not to compete and the debtor could not be compelled to perform services for the benefit of his creditors postpetition noncompetition payments were not property of the estate  we express no opinion whether in the absence of an annuity waldens postpetition noncompetition payments could have been excluded from the estate pursuant to sec  nevertheless we are persuaded that sound practical reasons as well as equitable ones support our conclusion that the annuity is exempt the noncompetition agreement provides that gess obligation to make monthly payments to walden is subject to performance by walden of the covenant not to compete thus payments to walden under the annuity are subject to his future compliance with his agreement not to compete with ges if waldens creditors receive the annuity payments walden will have little if any incentive to refrain from competing with ges thereby possibly depriving ges of the benefit of its bargain unless the trustee is able to obtain the present value of the annuity in a lump sum it is possible that ges could obtain judicial relief terminating future monthly payments in the event that walden breaches the covenant even if we assume arguendo that ges could be protected by an order compelling walden to comply with the noncompetition agreement the result might well be considered inequitable because it would deprive walden of the ability to work in his chosen profession in the area where he resides without any compensation for that deprivation in sum these considerations support our interpretation of art  as being consistent with texas policy of liberal construction of exemption statutes to the end that the laborer should be allowed means of obtaining a livelihood and thus prevent him and his family from becoming a charge on the public jm radford grocery co v mckean  swd   texcivappfort worth  no writ as well as the bankruptcy policy of providing debtors with a fresh start see eg hammond  br at  for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is reversed and judgment allowing the exemption is hereby rendered reversed and rendered   walden was not a partner in cookwalden funeral homes but owned stock in capital parks   fisher also owned stock in capital parks   in a letter to walden ges stated that it had placed him on indefinite leave of absence to investigate a possible breach of his fiduciary duties in connection with the discovery that money was being taken from the business without authorization ges did not accuse walden of taking money but stated that he as a key employee may have been aware of the situation   the settlement agreement also provided that ges would pay walden  in  monthly installments beginning april   and that walden would return  shares of ges stock to ges upon receipt of  to be paid in  monthly installments commencing april   these payments are not in issue   in matter of fernandez  fd  th cir  our court observed that texas rule of liberal construction had led one texas court to conclude that a dray is a wagon  an automobile is a carriage  a piano is household and kitchen furniture  and the word horse includes a bridle and saddle as well as the shoes on its feet and the rope and martingales around its neck and this spirit of liberal construction has been indulged until the courts have held that an unbroken colt is a horse  and even that a mule removed as he is one degree by consanguinity is nevertheless a horse furthermore in their effort to extend the humane and beneficial character of their exemption statute texas courts have become so blind to every other consideration that they have looked upon the mules father and pronounced himvoice ears and alla horse id at  quoting patterson v english  sw   texcivappamarillo  no writ   for a discussion of the import of the emphasized opening clause see note  infra   article  was amended effective september   texinscode art  west supp the amended version with emphasis on the new language provides in pertinent part for exemption of all money or benefits of any kind  to be paid or rendered to the insured or any beneficiary under any policy of insurance or annuity contract issued by a life health or accident insurance company  or under any plan or program of annuities and benefits in use by any employer or individual id emphasis added because we must apply the law in effect at the time that the debtors entered bankruptcy matter of volpe  fd at  we do not apply this amended version nevertheless the nature of the changes to art  indicates that the texas legislature intended to clarify its original intent with respect to the exemption of annuities rather than to alter the substantive effect of art  see id accordingly the amendment comports with our conclusion that the legislature intended to make available an exemption for the annuity at issue   the debtor relied on larevstatann sec  west supp all proceeds of and payments under annuity policies or plans shall be exempt from all liability for any debt and larevstatann sec b  the lawful beneficiary assignee or payee  of an annuity contract  shall be entitled to the proceeds and avails of the contract against the creditors and representatives of the annuitant   daniels v pecan valley ranch inc  swd  texappsan antonio  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   cited by the trustee is inapposite that case involved a personal injury structured settlement annuity that the annuitant claimed was exempt from garnishment id at   the annuitant did not contend that it was an annuity as contemplated by art  id at  n    the trustee contends based in large part on references to other portions of the texas insurance code that plan or program refers to retirement plans not to the one in issue article s opening clause notwithstanding any provision of this code other than this article added when the statute was amended effective june   a few months prior to the waldens bankruptcy petition clearly directs that it be interpreted and applied independent of any other provisions of the insurance code   the record on appeal which includes the briefs submitted by the waldens in the bankruptcy and district courts does not reflect that this point was presented to either of those courts however at oral argument waldens counsel stated that it was presented during oral argument in district court trustees counsel did not controvert that representation obviously this point should have been presented more fully in the bankruptcy court and presented in the briefs in district court but because it is not a separate issue and instead is simply additional legal authority to consider in reaching our decision we consider it here see united states v vontsteen  fd   th cir en banc we ordinarily have the discretion to decide legal issues that are not timely raised cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   eg atlantic mut ins co v truck ins exch  fd   th cir  an issue raised for the first time on appeal generally is not considered unless it involves a purely legal question or failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice   hammond was distinguished in in re bluman  br   bankredny  the noncompetition payments in bluman were not conditioned upon compliance with the covenant not to compete but instead became due upon the transfer of the debtors business id the bluman court disagreed with hammond § conclusion that a court may not compel compliance with a covenant not to compete pointing out that courts may enforce by negative injunction reasonable covenants not to compete id it therefore held that the covenant not to compete was not a personal services contract and that the consideration paid for the covenant was not tantamount to earnings from services performed by the debtor id under the facts in the case before us hammond is the more persuasive
