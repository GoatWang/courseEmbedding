to wrestle back market share from telustumblrpinterestgoogle pluslinkedinreddit shaw communications inc has launched a longawaited majorly upgraded television product that it expects will take on internetprotocol tv offerings from its main competitor called shaw bluesky tv the new product uses comcast’s x platform and is now available to calgary customers the western canadian cable company announced wednesday the day before it reports results for the first quarter of  and holds its annual general meeting shaw is pitching the new service which it plans to launch in other markets in the coming months as a “bestinclass” premium tv product that comes with a voicecontrolled remote and advanced search functions “we are proud to be the first in canada to pioneer comcast’s groundbreaking technology and to be their first international partner” shaw ceo brad shaw said in a statement but it won’t be the last television provider to turn to comcast’s x platform after abandoning its internal attempts to create an iptv in  and taking a million writedown in the process rogers communications inc announced in december it too inked a deal with comcast x killing its own iptv development in a move that will result in a million to million writedown it will roll out the new technology in  the adoption of comcast’s platform comes as cable companies lose subscribers to

years since launching the platform technology and product president tony werner said in a joint interview with shaw president jay mehr on wednesday “it’s iptv but it’s a lot more than that” werner said adding it uses cloudbased software that allows comcast to make changes to its offerings on the fly the voice remote has been a “huge success” with usage expected to double in  he said and the platform can be used for internet of things applications such as turning up a thermostat   mehr said the new tv product will help bring cord cutters cord shavers and cord nevers back into the cable system “this for sure is a differentiated video product” he said noting the variety of applications available including netflix he wouldn’t say exactly when he expects shaw to quell subscriber losses but said he expects it will gain traction more quickly than comcast did “it won’t take us that long” mehr said  comments share your thoughts fp tech desk worried about amazoncom dont be facebook
