market is expected to grow at a cagr of  till   trend of using organic and biofertilizers in china according to the report major results of investigation and assessment of agricultural land classes throughout the country released by the prc ministry of land and resources about  of the agricultural land in china was classified as medium to low classes in terms of soil nutrient conditions indicating that the fertility of soil in china has been degenerating and affecting the quality of produce and food in the last three decades chemical fertilizers accounted for more than  of the fertilizer market in china and it was commonly believed that it was one of the most important factors attributing to the continuous and serious degeneration of soil fertility in china many agronomists in china now believe that the increasing use of organic and biofertilizers will be the upcoming solution to improve the soil nutrient quality of farmland in china on th july  the prc ministry of industry and information technology published a policy document titled instructive opinion about the changing development of chemical fertilizer industry in china encouraging the development of new effective and environmentally friendly fertilizers and looking forward to increasing the use of new fertilizers nonchemical fertilizers from  to  for fertilizer applications in china page  of  in addition the prc ministry of agriculture pronounced in its annual prominent document no  in  that the zerogrowth of chemical fertilizers in china target has to be achieved by  in china parallel with this policy the increasing uses of microbial compound fertilizer liquidtype specialized slowrelease and controlledrelease fertilizers would become the future trend in the fertilizer market in china in the upcoming years  classification of fertilizers in the china market there are many ways to classify fertilizers fertilizers are usually divided into inorganic fertilizers organic fertilizers and microbial fertilizers currently inorganic fertilizers have a decisive market share and impact in the fertilizer market followed by organic fertilizer in contrast microbial fertilizers have a lesser share of the fertilizer market according to the rules and regulations under the measures for the administration of fertilizer registration prc national standard for fertilizer and soil conditioner terminology gbt  prc agricultural industry standards ny  ny and nyt  the following terms shall have the following meanings in chinas fertilizers market i fertilizer its main function is to provide nutrients for plants gbt  ii inorganic mineral fertilizer its nutrients are in the form of inorganic salt fertilizer which is made by the extraction physical andor chemical industrial method sulfur calcium cyanamide urea and its contraction and bone powder superphosphate are usually classified as inorganic fertilizers gbt  iii complex fertilizer a fertilizer manufactured only by chemical method and its components are specified with at least  out of the  nutrients namely nitrogen phosphorus potassium gbt  iv organic fertilizer a fertilizer containing carbon its components mainly made from plants andor animals ny  v microbial fertilizer it refers to fertilizer products which contain specific living microorganisms and have specific fertilizers effects when applied to agricultural production the specific fertilizers effects include the provision of good conditions of soil and plant environment and include the provision of necessary nutrients to crops together with beneficial effects from metabolism of these microorganisms upon plants measures for the administration of fertilizer registration vi organic microbial fertilizer it is made by combining microorganisms which have specific function and organic materials mainly animal and plant residues such as livestock and poultry manure crop stalks etc which are disinfected and decomposed they possess the functions of both microbial fertilizers and organic fertilizers ny vii compound microbial fertilizer it is a vivo microbial product with a combination of specific microorganisms and nutrients which can provide maintain or improve plant nutrition improve the yield of agricultural products or improve the quality of agricultural products ny  t  page  of   classification of our fertilizers currently our fertilizer products have passed the product standard promulgated by the ministry of agriculture and hence have obtained the registration certificate of compound microbial fertilizers from the ministry of agriculture as described in section  and  below to the measures for the administration of fertilizer registration in other words our products are fertilizer products which contain specific living microorganisms and have specific effects when applied in agricultural production the specific effects include the provision of nutrients to soil and crops and beneficial effects on the metabolism of plants  production of mineralbased biofertilizer mbf as discussed above china lacks highquality soluble potash resources almost all the current proven potash resources ie soluble ones are in the remote provinces of qinghai and xinjiang these potash resources mainly exist as brine in salt lakes instead of in rock salt mines common in canada or fsu such resources are generally lower in grading and more polluting during the extraction process china has abundant resources in insoluble potash however it is difficult to convert such insoluble potash resources into fertilizers under existing technology figure  distribution of potash resources in china page  of  most common chemical potash fertilizers are readily available in china however the overuse of chemical potash fertilizers in general can cause pollution problems deterioration in soil quality including soil hardening and alkalinity and exhaustion of other secondary and micronutrients not added in chemical fertilizers all these further reduce soil fertility and ultimately making it barren through repeated research and testing we developed and invented our mbf out of a mixture of microorganisms from locally available mineral shale which originally cannot be used as fertilizers certain bacteria called potash solubilizing bacteria are capable of decomposing minerals in feldspar and mica crystals present in soils and rocks to release the potassium contained therein a wide range of bacteria has been reported to release k from kbearing minerals in soils but little information is available on potassium solubilization by bacteria their mechanisms of solubilization and effect of such bacteria inoculation on nutrient availability in soils and growth of different crops the efficiency of k solubilization was found to vary with various factors including the nature of potassium bearing minerals the bacterial strains used acidity and aerobic conditions a lot of researchers and scholars around the world are carrying out studies in this regard including china and india where potash is in serious shortage page  of  our new product of mbf is a proven product that can serve as a low cost alternative for china that is suitable for various applications and that is sustainable and environmentally friendly shanxi lutu currently holds a patent in prc on the production method of the mbf produced patent number zl  production process shanxi lutus mbf are manufactured from mineral shale which contains a significant amount of unavailable potassium and other minerals beneficial to plants microorganisms are added to release such minerals to become rapidly available nutrients and slowly available nutrients in the soil our fertilizers can also be doses of potassium solubilizing bacteria to be applied directly to crops and soils to release unavailable minerals and potassium already present in the field our mbf production process is shown in the following figure figure  mineralbased biofertiizer manufacturing process  potassium solubilising bacteria and phosphate solubilising bacteria include bacillus megairiusdebary bacillus mucilaginosus andor bacillussubtilis page  of   raw material sourcing for manufacturing of our mineralbased biofertilizer the sources of raw materials are elaborated below mineral shale historical procurement according to news reports shanxi province ranks as one of the top provinces in china in terms of the reserve of mineral shale apart from shanxi mineral shale are mainly found in guizhou province bacteria the mixture of strains of bacteria that is most suitable for application to the local mineral shale was tested and tried by our scientists and researchers in the past years our scientists and researchers currently safeguard the exact details of the strains of bacteria used and have been in storage these act as seed strains which can be later used and multiplied in the production facilities when production starts humic acid humic acid is obtained after

certain peak periods for absorption of nutrients in addition there is uniqueness in the nutrients required during the growth of rice in which trace elements like zinc and silicon are essential page  of  shanxi lutus specialized fertilizers for rice are designed according to the growth characteristics of rice and the nutrients required according to the field trial conducted by the soil and fertilizer station of jinzhong city shanxi for the period from april  to november  there was a  increase in output of rice when our  lu kun dan microbial compound fertilizer was applied in the field our fertilizers also contain major nutrients and trace elements such as zinc and silicon which are essential elements to the proper and normal growth of rice our specialized fertilizers for rice have gone through field trial for a full harvesting season results of the field trial in shanxi and reports from some users showed that by applying our specialized rice fertilizers the output of rice is higher  clients and trials the use of fertilisers affects crop yield significantly and fertilisers of low quality or with impurities may in fact pollute the soil and kill or inhibit seed germination or plant growth instead therefore farmers are very careful when they switch fertilisers and have asked us to provide samples for field trial before extensive use of our fertilizers shanxi lutu has approached several clients and provided them with samples for field trials throughout  after a small scale production at the plant facilities is possible potential clients have designated a small area of their farmland as trial zones and apply fertilizers from us instead of their usual fertilisers while the rest of their farmland have continued using their usual fertilisers as a control germinating and growing condition of the crops are studied during the period and yield and produce analysis are done after harvest some of our clients have produced internal official reports to evaluate the performance of our fertilizers as shown below those reports were in chinese format and we did not have the translated copies in summary our fertilizers generated a positive feedback from field trial around crop yield and the performance results varied from similar performance to significant increase in performance in comparison with the currently available fertilizers in the market page  of

compound fertilizers this is the first time we apply lutu fertilizers and previously we applied other brands of fertilizers it is expected that if lutu fertilizers are applied for consecutive years the problem of soil compaction can be improved and the quality and quantity of yield can be improved page  of  our marketing and sales strategy  marketing strategy as of  shanxi lutu is at the development stage of selling its products sales of the fertilizers mainly concentrate in various vegetables fruit crops rice and maize as china has over  million hectare of rice fields national bureau of statistics of china consumption of fertilizers was estimated to be in the range of  million tons per annum in  the marketing strategy of shanxi lutu in china will be adjusted and will include the following major aspects  focusing on the sales of specialized fertilizers for rice  continuing to develop the organic fertilizers market for vegetables and fruits and  continuing to develop the organic biofertilizers market  customers after years of research and preparation shanxi lutu has begun production and has established a sales team to carry out sales and marketing activities in  most sales transactions are done through distributorships at the moment our major distributors at this stage are as follows a heilongjiang based distributor which is distributing our products in  counties in the heilongjiang province b shanxi based distributors who are distributing our products in  counties in the shanxi province and c distributors in other provinces hainan fujian inner mongolia hebei and yunnan since china is a big country with huge territories our marketing strategy is to secure more distributorship deals from nationwide distributors to penetrate into the markets of different regions in china in addition to the distributors in the provinces mentioned above we are developing our sales network in the provinces of jilin jiangxi sichuan hunan and hubei we are actively looking for distributors in these provinces  product delivery there are two means of transportation for fertilizers in china if the destination is over  km away rail transportation is preferred if the destination is within  km road transportation is preferred  rail transportation according to the notice on adjusting railway freight price to further improve price formation mechanism promulgated by the national development and reform commission the national rail freight benchmark rate of goods is increased by an average of  cent per ton of kilometers that is from the current  cents to  cents there are also other costs including loading fees railway station service fees railway handling costs and other expenses the freight fees are usually borne by the purchaser  road transportation the purchaser normally arranges for the transportation and pays for the freight fees page  of   timing the location of the client determines their fertiliser application schedule and needs farmers in northern provinces of china need to apply fertilisers in spring they generally have only one harvest in a year and delivery needs to be made around march farmers in southern provinces of china can produce two to three harvests a year and generally order year round  logistics arrangements and pricing shanxi lutu generally prices its orders free on board in taiyuan we can make logistics arrangements on behalf of the client or deliver the product to designated locations at the cost of the client either by charging the cost directly back to the client or building the cost into an elevated markup unit price  payment terms in line with the current practice of payments in the fertilizers industry in china our clients general will settle the majority of payments with us after harvest when the produce is sold on the market and their working capital is recouped this is especially true for clients in the northeastern provinces as crop growths is slower and produce only one harvest during the year however some users usually the smaller distributors may agree to paying an upfront payment of around  given they can have multiple harvests during the year therefore there is a significant working capital requirement upfront to start production  employees shanxi lutu currently has about  employees in various departments production engineering and maintenance administration sales and marketing finance and accounting shanxi lutu usually retains around  individuals in the capacity of independent contractors during the peak season to assist production  competition  competitive advantages our developing experience and technology combine to obtain several competitive advantages as follows  nature of mbf page  of  through the life activities of microorganisms shanxi lutus mbf are able to promote crop growth improve the resistance of crops to pests improve the quality of crops and provide soil amendment directly or indirectly our mbf can reduce the usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides significantly and are proven more efficient than other brands of fertilizers in decomposing the existing chemical fertilizers and pesticides accumulated in soil see figure  trial results and promotion notice of a heilongjiang based client and figure  trial results of a chongqing based client  patents were granted for mbf production we obtained a patent of the production method of mbf in  we also have two other patent applications pending the approval of state intellectual property office in the prc and one patent application which is in the process of pct and is prepared to be submitted to united states patent and trademark office uspto for registration once the approval procedures of these patent applications are completed we can benefit from more tax reductions under the policies of the prc government  our biofertiliser products have received positive feedback from clients our products have been tested in several locations in china with local farmers and users and have received favourable feedbacks  we do not currently observe the emergence of other significant competitors in the market we have already established our phase i production facilities of  tons per annum and operations we have not yet been aware that there is another significant competitor within the shanxi province with comparable scale or product quality we do not guarantee that there will be no emergence of other significant competitors in the future  our research and development capability allows further expansion to other parts of china we have research and development capability and have successfully landed on breakthroughs with further patent applications in  after the initial patent we are able to perform studies on the feasibility of utilising mineral resources in other parts of china to establish production facilities outside of our initial facilities  our mbf benefits from the following chinas state policies of enhancing the potential of the organic and biofertilizers markets in china these state policies highlight the conservation of agricultural environment and emphasize that preventive measures tackling agricultural pollution should be stepped up and zero growth of the usage of chemical fertilizers should be achieved page  of  the action plan of achieving zero growth of chemical fertilizers usage at  promulgated by the ministry of agriculture in february  cpc central committee on national economic and social development fiveyear plan published in november  certain opinions on implementing new ideas of development and accelerating modernization of agriculture to realize the goal of comprehensive water conservancy published in december  and prevention of soil pollution action plan published in may   our products which benefit from the tax reductions policy favors organic fertilizers in china according to the notice concerning the clarification of enforcement standard of organic fertilizers published by the state administration of taxation in january  taxpayers can be exempted from vat if they engage in the production distribution or retail of organic fertilizer products accordingly we are exempted from paying the vat tax which is currently  in addition after shanxi lutu has obtained the abovementioned two patents it is believed that we will be categorized as advanced technology companies and can benefit from profit tax reductions from the current rate of  to   we believe we are poised to become one of the largest mineralbased biofertiliser and compound biofertiliser manufacturers with consistent product quality and competent quality control we believe that there are not many competitors in china which can provide the same comprehensive fertilizing solution to farmers with complete provision of macronutrients n p k secondary nutrients and micronutrients  competitive disadvantages  we need to fully utilize our production capacity some of our clients wish to order more but we lack the working capital to start production to meet our clients demands page  of   we have limited sales networks we need to expand the sales networks to diversify our sales and penetrate into different regions in china  our research and development capability is limited although we have developed several fertilizer products we still need to recruit more scientists and researchers to develop new products  intellectual property  our key technology shanxi lutu possesses the technology to produce organic microbiological multielement compound microorganism fertilizers which can serve as a low cost alternative of fertilizers for china that are suitable for various applications and that are sustainable and environmentally friendly the microbial ingredients of our patented technology have the effect to solubilize the insoluble minerals including phosphorus and potassium in the soil or in potash shale through biodegradation this technology allows us to extract insoluble minerals including potassium from potash shale as mentioned the ability to extract insoluble minerals including potassium from mineral shale effectively reduces production cost and allows us to utilize reliable raw materials it also shortens the manufacturing process by replacing chemical potash extraction processes with biodegradation the microbial ingredients can also be added to the fertilizer products sold to customers the microbial contents added to the fertilizer products can solubilize the insoluble phosphorus and potassium in the soil as a result the now soluble phosphorus and potassium can be easily absorbed by crops or plants therefore the fertilizer products of shanxi lutu are also soil conditioners with the effect of amending and improving soil qualities such result cannot be achieved by chemical fertilizers hence our fertilizer products have a competitive edge over chemical fertilizers shanxi lutu produces various fertilizers through the combination of various percentages of minerals humic acid bacteria and other supplementary ingredients we can undergo raw material procurement for organic microbiological fertilizer production the minerals shale is currently available in different provinces in china shanxi lutu has signed an agreement with a village in shanxi to utilize such mineral shale local workers from the village can be hired to extract the mineral shale without significant difficulties humic acid is a byproduct of coal mines and is abundantly present in the markets in many provinces of china other supplements are usually commonly available and purchased at the market page  of  the currently marketed products are designed to be in pellet forms that would be easy for farmers to apply both products have obtained the necessary fertilizer registration

fertilizer products we have recently started a trial program with the rice crops research laboratory of the guangdong agricultural science institute to test our various fertilizer products as applied to different types of rice seeds in the guangdong province the objective of the test is to find out the best combinations of rice seeds and fertilizers especially organic biofertilizers for rice production in terms of both quality and quantity one of our fertilizer products lutu brand microbial organic fertilizers specialized for vegetable and fruit crops was approved as an organic fertilizer by the organic food development and certification centre of china the ofdc in  the ofdc is a specialized certification body registered at the prc certification and accreditation administration cnca and is both nationally china national accreditation service for conformity assessment — cnas and internationally international federation of organic agriculture movements – ifoam accredited the further development of our fertilizer products will be in line with the direction of our mission namely the adoption of ecological social and economical systems that are based on the principles of organic agriculture also consistent with our mission we have since  become a member of the california institute of food and agricultural research cifar at the university of california at davis we look forward to collaborating with cifar and other members to undertake further projects relating to agricultural developments page  of   growth strategy  expansion of production capacity shanxi lutu started a larger scale of production of fertilizers in  we would like to further expand the existing production facilities as soon as possible to address the existing needs of our clients to grab market share and to expand into other markets such as the soil amendment market previous marketing efforts of the company have concluded that our products are widely accepted in various locations among local farmers since our production cost is significantly lower than the cost of the conventional production method to produce compound fertiliser we are confident that the production capacity can be fully utilized soon after the expansions are completed an expansion is planned for the existing facilities in  phases each of which we believe will provide an additional  ton per annum of production capacity to the plant a portion of the land plot that shanxi lutu owns is currently vacant and a vacant land plot of c sqm  mu is also available adjacent to the existing site for the expansion of phase  phase  will also be located in a location potentially adjacent to the source of mineral shale after these expansions we expect the total capacity of the production facilities of

under the rules renminbi is freely convertible for current account items such as trade and servicerelated foreign exchange transactions but not for capital account items such as direct investment loan or investment in securities outside china unless the prior approval of andor registration with the state administration of foreign exchange of the peoples republic of china safe or its local counterparts as the case may be is obtained to the rules foreign invested enterprises fies in china may purchase foreign currency without the approval of safe for trade and servicerelated foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions they may also retain foreign exchange subject to a cap approved by safe to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends in addition if a foreign company acquires a subsidiary in china the acquired company will also become an fie however the relevant prc government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of fies to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future in addition foreign exchange transactions for direct investment loan and investment in securities outside china are still subject to limitations and require approvals from andor registration with safe dividend distribution under applicable prc regulations fies in china may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits if any determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations in addition a fie in china is required to set aside at least  of its aftertax profit based on prc accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves reach  of its registered capital these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends the enterprise income tax law and its implementing rules generally provide that a  withholding tax applies to chinasourced income derived by nonresident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes unless the jurisdiction of incorporation of such enterprises shareholder has a tax treaty with china that provides for a different withholding arrangement shanxi lutu is considered a fie as it is directly held by hong kong prolific according to a  tax treaty between the mainland and hong kong dividends payable by an fie in china to a company in hong kong that directly holds at least  of the equity interest in the fie will be subject to no more than  withholding tax we expect that such  withholding tax will apply to dividends paid to hong kong prolific by shanxi lutu but this treatment will depend on our status as a nonresident enterprise page  of  item a risk factors risk factors related to our business in order to grow at the pace expected by management we will require additional capital to support our longterm growth strategies if we are unable to obtain additional capital we may be unable to proceed with our plans and we may be forced to curtail our operations we will require additional working capital to support our longterm growth strategies and better utilize our production capacity which includes development of marketing and research and development of new products our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities if any may vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on the volume of business during the period and other matters we may not be able to obtain adequate levels of additional financing whether through equity financing debt financing or other sources additional financings could result in significant dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to our current outstanding securities if we are unable to raise additional financing we may be unable to implement our longterm growth strategies develop or enhance our products and services take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis or at all even if additional financings are available they may be on terms that we deem unacceptable or are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value dividend preferences liquidation preferences or other terms substantially all of our business assets and operations are located in the prc substantially all of our business assets and operations are located in the prc the economy of the prc differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects the economy of the prc has been transitioning from a planned economy to a marketoriented economy although in recent years the prc government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises a substantial portion of productive assets in the prc are still owned by the prc government in addition the prc government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies it also exercises significant control over the prcs economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies some of these measures benefit the overall economy of the prc but may have a negative effect on us page  of  our planned expansion could be delayed or adversely affected by among other things difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing technical difficulties or human or other resource constraints our planned expansion in our production capacity in biofertilizers could be delayed or adversely affected by among other things difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing technical difficulties or human or other resource constraints moreover the costs involved in these projects may exceed those originally contemplated costs savings and other economic benefits expected from these projects may not materialize as a result of any such project delays cost overruns or changes in market circumstances failure to obtain intended economic benefits from these projects could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating performances our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations our limited operating history may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business the company entered into business in  we cannot guarantee that we will achieve profitability or that we will not incur net losses in the future we will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience including the potential failure to obtain sufficient working capital to support our expansion expand our product offerings and maintain the high quality of our products manage our expanding operations and continue to fill customers orders on time maintain adequate control of our expenses allowing us to realize anticipated income growth implement our product development sales and acquisition strategies and adapt and modify them as needed successfully integrate any future acquisitions and anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the electronics and information technology industry resulting from changes in government regulations mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors technological developments and other significant competitive and market dynamics if we are not successful in addressing any or all of the foregoing risks our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected page  of  we will incur significant costs to ensure compliance with united states corporate governance and accounting requirements we will incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the sec since we had no obligations as a public company prior to completion of the investment transaction we did not have any such expenses prior to that date we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly we also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs the audit report included in this annual report was prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the public company accounting oversight board and as a result you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the sec as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the united states and a firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board united states “pcaob“ is required by the laws of the united states to undergo regular inspections by the pcaob to assess its compliance with the laws of the united states and professional standards because our auditors are located in the prc a jurisdiction where the pcaob is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the prc authorities our auditors are not currently inspected by the pcaob inspections of other firms that the pcaob has conducted outside china have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit procedures and quality control procedures which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections in china prevents the pcaob from regularly evaluating our auditor’s statements audits and quality control procedures as a result investors may be deprived of the benefits of pcaob inspections the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of auditors in china makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s quality control and audit procedures as compared to auditors outside of china that are subject to pcaob inspections investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements page  of  we may not be able to meet the internal control reporting requirements imposed by the sec resulting in a possible decline in the price of our common stock and our inability to obtain future financing as directed by section  of the sarbanesoxley act the sec adopted rules requiring each public company to include a report of management on the companys internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports although the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act exempts companies with a public float of less than  million from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our financial controls this exemption does not affect the requirement that we include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting and does not affect the requirement to include the independent registered public accounting firms attestation if our public float exceeds  million while we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section  of the sarbanesoxley act there is a risk that we may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements imposed by this rule regardless of whether we are required to receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls if we are unable to do so investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our stock price and ability to obtain equity or debt financing as needed could suffer in addition in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls in connection with its audit of our financial statements and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures it is possible that we would be unable to file our annual report on form k with the sec which could also adversely affect the market for and the market price of our common stock and our ability to secure additional financing as needed we depend on a network of distributors to sustain our business if our relationship with our distributors is disrupted our revenue will be reduced and our business could become unprofitable our sales to our distributors remain the main source of our revenues if a distributor terminated its relationship with us or if its sales of our products were seriously impaired for any reason our overall sales results would be diminished in addition if our distributors were to act in concert to change the economic terms of our relationship with them the result could have a negative effect on our profitability page  of  our demands are seasonal and our production capacity has not been utilized we need to expand our sales and have better production planning some of our customers will usually only place orders during the sowing season which usually lasts for only one to two months during the nonsowing season of our clients we may not be able to utilize our production capacity due to a lack of orders currently most of our orders come from hailongjiang which orders will only come in around february and march the sowing and harvesting cycle is different across china for illustrations users from xinjiang province need to apply a significant amount of base fertilizers after each fall harvest before the soil is frozen to recondition and increase the fertility of the generally sandy soil therefore a significant portion of the orders will need to be delivered around september or october users in the northeastern part of china usually apply fertilizers in spring during the sowing season they generally have only one harvest in a year and delivery needs to be made around march plantations in the southern and southwestern parts of china can produce two to three harvests a year and generally they place orders all year around therefore we need to expand our sales networks to different parts of china only by doing so we would have to potential of securing orders all year around and hence have a greater potential of utilizing our production capacity there is a time gap between placements of orders and payment from clients we may face liquidity problems during this time gap it is market practice in china that customers usually only place orders in the sowing season and settle the majority of payments with the company after harvest when the crops are sold on the market and their working capital is recouped this is especially true for the northeastern part of china or xinjiang province as crop growth is slower and there is only one harvest during the year some users may agree to paying an upfront payment of around  given they can have multiple harvests during the year therefore there is a significant working capital requirement upfront to start production due to the time gap between placement of orders and payments we need to raise more working capital to provide more liquidity to the company and to help the company pay production costs more easily our failure to raise sufficient working capital would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition page  of  if able lead cannot repay the outstanding loan we may not be able to acquire the majority shares of lutu international without any encumbrances as mentioned above under the majority interest exchange agreement able lead needs to repay the outstanding loan in the sum of  million before we can acquire the  of shares in lutu international through the share exchange there is a risk that able lead cannot raise enough funds and there will be a delay for us to acquire all the outstanding shares of lutu international or we may not be able to acquire all the outstanding shares of lutu international our current dependence on a limited number of customers may cause significant fluctuations or declines in our revenues consequently any one of the following events may cause material declines in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations reduction delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers due to a reduction in our customers’ product sales or other reasons selection by one or more of our significant customers of our competitors’ products decision by one or more of our significant customers to selfproduce products that are currently provided by us loss of one or more of our significant customers and our failure to obtain additional or replacement customers to replace the lost sales volume and failure of any of our significant customers to make timely payment for our products failure to make strategic acquisitions and to establish and maintain strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and prospects we may make strategic acquisitions and establish and maintain strategic relationships with third parties in addition we may enter into strategic relationships with third parties to gain access to capital or funding for research and development programs process development programs and commercialization activities or to reduce the risk of developing and scalingup for commercial production of our anticipated pipeline of products we cannot assure you however that we will be able to successfully make such strategic acquisitions or establish strategic relationships with third parties that will prove to be beneficial for our business our inability in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and prospects in addition strategic acquisitions and relationships with third parties could subject us to a number of risks including but not limited to our inability to integrate new operations products personnel services or technologies unforeseen or hidden liabilities disagreement with our strategic relationship partners page  of  our inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of strategic acquisitions or other strategic relationships and potential loss of or harm to employees or customer relationships any of these events could impair our ability to manage our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations such risks could also result in our failure to derive the intended benefits of the strategic acquisitions or strategic relationships and we may be unable to recover our investment in such initiatives risk factors in doing business in china fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities the value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and renminbi and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated appreciation or depreciation in the value of renminbi relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we may issue that will be exchanged into us dollars as well as earnings from and the value of any us dollardenominated investments we may make in the future since july  renminbi is no longer pegged to the us dollar although the peoples bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant shortterm fluctuations in the exchange rate renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term moreover it is possible that in the future prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not entered into any hedging transactions while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all in addition our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currencies page  of  restrictions under prc law on shanxilutus ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business pay dividends to you and otherwise fund and conduct our businesses practically all of our revenues are earned by shanxi lutu prc regulations restrict the ability of shanxi lutu to make dividends and other payments to its offshore parent company prc legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by shanxi lutu only out of its accumulated aftertax profits if any determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations shanxi lutu also is required under prc laws and regulations to allocate at least  of its annual aftertax profits determined in accordance with prc gaap to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches  of its registered capital allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans advances or cash dividends any limitations on the ability of shanxi lutu to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us we conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries and affiliate in the prc our principal operating subsidiaries shanxi lutu and shenzhen lutu are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in china and in particular laws applicable to foreigninvested enterprises the prc legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value since  a series of new prc laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in china however since the prc legal system continues to evolve rapidly the interpretations of many laws regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws regulations and rules involves uncertainties which may limit legal protections available to you and us in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention as a result it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the united states or to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states against our operations subsidiaries and affiliates in china restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively all our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in renminbi under prc law renminbi is currently convertible under the current account which includes dividends and trade and servicerelated foreign exchange transactions but not under the capital account which includes foreign direct investment and loans the relevant prc government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in renminbi any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in renminbi to fund our business activities outside china that are denominated in foreign currencies page  of  foreign exchange transactions by our prc operating subsidiary under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with prc government authorities including safe in particular if our prc operating subsidiary borrows foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders these loans must be registered with safe and if we finance the subsidiary by means of additional capital contributions these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities including the ministry of commerce or their respective local counterparts these limitations could affect their ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act and prc anticorruption law and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us persons and issuers for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to the prc anticorruption law which strictly prohibits the payment of bribes to government officials we principally have operations agreements with third parties and make sales in china which may experience corruption our activities in china create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees consultants or distributors because these parties are not always subject to our control we believe that to date we have complied in all material respects with the provisions of the fcpa and prc anticorruption law however our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees consultants or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa or prc anticorruption law may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire page  of  risks relating to the vie structure our ability to manage and operate lutu international under the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership we obtain the management of lutu international by adopting a vie structure through the contractual arrangements virtually all of our revenues will be generated through lutu international our plans for future growth are based substantially on growing the operations of lutu international however the contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with management control over lutu international as direct ownership under the contractual arrangement as a legal matter if lutu international fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements we may have to i incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements and ii rely on legal remedies under the laws of cayman islands which we cannot be sure would be effective therefore if we are unable to effectively control lutu international it may have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow our revenues shareholders of able lead have potential conflicts of interest with us which may adversely affect our business dr leung kwong tak michael dr leung the sole shareholder of able lead which owns  of lutu internationals outstanding equity interests is also a beneficial owner of the common stock of gvbt equity interests held by dr leung in gvbt is less than its interest in lutu international as a result of the investment transaction in addition the shareholders equity interest in gvbt may be further diluted as a result of any future offering of equity securities conflicts of interest may arise as a result of such dual shareholding and governance structure if such conflicts arise dr leung may not act in our best interests and such conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor in addition dr leung may breach or cause lutu international to breach or refuse to renew the contractual arrangements that allow us to exercise effective control over lutu international and to receive economic benefits from lutu international if we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and such shareholders or any future beneficial owners of lutu international we would have to rely on arbitral or legal proceedings to remedy the situation such arbitral and legal proceedings may cost us substantial financial and other resources and result in disruption of our business the outcome of which may adversely affect gvbt our proposed acquisition of shares of lutu international from able lead is subject to the repayment of the outstanding loan our proposed acquisition of shares of lutu international from able lead is conditional upon the shares of lutu international being free from encumbrances therefore it is critical whether able lead can repay the outstanding loan before the maturity date there is a risk that the current vie structure has to be continued for an indefinite period of time page  of  risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents protect our existing patent operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and maintain trade secrets both in china and other countries patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions accordingly the validity breadth and enforceability of our patent and any s and the existence of potentially blocking patent rights of others cannot be predicted either in china or other countries in addition competitors may manufacture and sell our potential products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable in addition even where patent protection is obtained thirdparty competitors may challenge our patent claims in the patent office of china the ability of such competitors to sell such products in the united states or in foreign countries where we have obtained patents is usually governed by the patent laws of the countries in which the product is sold we will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our patent and our patent applications should we lack the funds to maintain our patent and patent applications or to enforce our rights against infringers we could be adversely impacted even if claims of infringement are without merit any such action could divert the time and attention of management and impair our ability to access additional capital andor cost us significant funds to defend currently we have one patent issued in the name of shanxi lutu which expires january   our patent applications are pending and there is a risk that these patent applications are eventually unsuccessful intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage the following examples are illustrative others may be able to make alternative technology and processes which can also produce potash biofertilizers that are substitutes for our products but that are not covered by the claims of our patent our patent applications or other technology or processes that we may in the future either own or exclusively license page  of  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business we may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome in china our success also will depend in part on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or controlled by others pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies universities research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received or may obtain issued patents in the united states or elsewhere relating to aspects of our technology it is uncertain whether the issuance of any thirdparty patents will require us to alter our products or processes obtain licenses or cease certain activities some thirdparty applications or patents may conflict with our issued patent or pending applications any such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the scope or value of our issued patent any patents that may result from our patent applications or any license rights we may have with respect to patents or technology of others our patents may be challenged under the prc patent system competitors may successfully challenge our patents our patent may be challenged invalidated or held unenforceable which could materially and adversely harm our business and results of operations our pending patent applications may not be approved or the scope of claims may be restricted in the final approvals which may provide insufficient protection for our technologies processes or products in addition it is possible that competitors could under prc patent law apply for and obtain a compulsory license to our patent and any future patents we may obtain should we refuse to grant a license for those patents on reasonable terms furthermore the existence of a patent does not provide assurance that the production sale or use of our products does not infringe the patent rights of another third parties may also have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing products utilizing our patented technologies or processes furthermore it is possible that our technologies processes or products may infringe on patents that have not yet been issued specifically in china and many other jurisdictions patent protection starts from the date the application is first filed therefore our attempt to enforce any prc patent may be defeated by thirdparty patents issued on a later date if the applications for those patents were filed before ours and the technologies or processes underlying such patents are the same or substantially similar to ours in such a case a third party with an earlier application could force us to pay to license its patented technology sue us for patent infringement and challenge the validity of our patent and any future patents we may obtain page  of  risks related to the market for our stock generally there is only a very limited market for our common stock while our common stock is listed for quotation on the otc pink market there is currently no trading in our common stock we cannot provide any assurances as to when or if an active market will develop for our common stock our common stock is subject to penny stock rules our common stock is subject to rule g through g under the exchange act which imposes certain sales practice requirements on brokerdealers which sell our common stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally individuals with net worth’s in excess of  or annual incomes exceeding  or  together with their spouses for transactions covered by this rule a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale this rule adversely affects the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock additionally our common stock is subject to the sec regulations for penny stock penny stock includes any equity security that is not listed on a national exchange and has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions the regulations require that prior to any nonexempt buysell transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule set forth by the sec relating to the penny stock market must be delivered to the purchaser of such penny stock this disclosure must include the amount of commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current price quotations for the common stock the regulations also require that monthly statements be sent to holders of penny stock that disclose recent price information for the penny stock and information of the limited market for penny stocks these requirements adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock page  of  you may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of the common stock in the future we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of common stock offered hereby we are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of  shares of capital stock consisting of shares of common stock as of the closing of the share exchange there will be  shares of our common stock outstanding we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees future acquisitions future sales of its securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes the future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts including at a price or exercise prices below the price at which shares of the common stock will be initially quoted on the otc pink market we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors the jobs act permits “emerging growth companies” like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to companies having a public float of less than  million for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company during that period we are permitted to omit the auditor’s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the sarbanesoxley act companies with a public float of  million or more must otherwise procure such an attestation beginning with their second annual report after their initial public offering for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company we are also excluded from the requirement to submit “sayonpay” “sayonpay frequency” and “sayonparachute” votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure compared to larger companies in addition as an emerging growth company we can take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such time as we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile page  of  item  financial information overview the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on july   since incorporation the company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a possible business combination following the closing of investment transaction the companys principal business became the business of lutu international after the consummation of the investment transaction the company currently has  shares of common stock issued and outstanding critical accounting policies and estimates the companys consolidated financial statements which are filed as exhibits to this current report on form k have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business going concern as of december   the lutu group the company we our us has an accumulated deficit of  and its current liabilities exceed its current assets resulting in negative working capital of  in view of the matters described above recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts and realization of the portion of current liabilities into revenue shown in the accompanying balance sheets are dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn are dependent upon the company’s ability to raise additional financing and to succeed in its future operations the company may need additional cash resources to operate during the upcoming  months and the continuation of the company may be dependent upon the continuing financial support of investors directors andor stockholders of the company however there is no assurance that equity or debt offerings will be successful in raising sufficient funds to assure the eventual profitability of the company these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern management has taken the following steps to revise its operating and financial requirements which it believes are sufficient to provide the company with the ability to continue as a going concern the company is actively pursuing additional funding which would enhance capital employed and strategic partners which would increase revenue bases or reduce operation expenses management believes that the above actions will allow the company to continue its operations throughout this fiscal year page  of  use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could materially differ from those estimates significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include among other things accounting for asset impairments allowances for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization the collection of revenues from the agricultural cooperative economic and political risks the companys operations are mainly conducted in hong kong and china and a large number of customers are located in northern china accordingly the companys business financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political economic and legal environment in hong kong and china and by the general state of the economy in hong kong and china the companys operations and customers in hong kong and northern china are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in north america and western europe these include risks associated with among others the political economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange the companys results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in hong kong and china and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations antiinflationary measures currency conversion remittances abroad and rates and methods of taxation among other things foreign currency translation the companys financial statements are presented in the us dollar  which is the companys reporting currency while its functional currency are renminbi rmb and hong kong dollar hkd transactions in foreign
