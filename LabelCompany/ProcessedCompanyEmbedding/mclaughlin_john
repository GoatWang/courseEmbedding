this band worked it was too much really how could you not be totally exhausted physically and mentally playing this demanding music day after day night after night in city after city it amazes me the

partners mr mclaughlin missed the most recent installment of his syndicated public affairs program “the mclaughlin group” for more than three decades mr mclaughlin sat in judgment of national political trends on “the mclaughlin group” and goaded journalists and pundits into moving beyond fact into the argumentative terrain of ideological talking points and rhetorical hyperbole he corralled guests into critiquing political decisions and probabilities on a sliding scale of  to  — with  representing “metaphysical certitude” at times “the mclaughlin group” felt more like a crosstalk show than a talk show with the host interrupting his guests’ trains of thought or bellowing “wronnng” to express disapproval of their statements his approach forever changed audience expectations of public affairs programming mr mclaughlin’s impact can be glimpsed almost any night on cable news channels for better or worse and although no one ever mistook mr mclaughlin for a digital visionary his show’s staccato approach to wringing opinions from guests previewed the internet’s addiction to fast and unprocessed news bites the rev john j mclaughlin in  formally became a candidate for republican nomination to the us senate from rhode island upi telephoto “look at ‘the mclaughlin group’ now and it looks positively quaint” said syracuse university television historian robert thompson “the kind of thing mclaughlin was doing is being done in so many places” although “the mclaughlin group” dominated his later life mr mclaughlin had a threeact career that started in the priesthood he worked his way into politics running unsuccessfully for a us senate seat in  and later landing a job in the nixon white house as a speechwriter for the president and one of his fiercest defenders through the watergate scandal mr mclaughlin attracted media attention upon which he capitalized to get into television when “the mclaughlin group” launched in  on wrc channel  in washington dc political chat shows were unrecognizable by modern standards “washington week in review” produced by the public television outlet weta was a cerebral and quiet product “agronsky and company” on wusa channel  occasionally veered into shouting and political showmanship but not with a great degree of reliability mr mclaughlin saw an opening in the market for tv blather “energy tempo and bonhomie” he said were a few of the vital ingredients he sought to infuse in the program along with “firstrate reporting and straight opinion” the program’s format like its inspiration remained steady over the show’s run with mr mclaughlin sitting alone in the middle of the set and liberal and conservative commentators tethered in his orbit those guests regularly fielded not so much questions from mr mclaughlin as demands in a september  show during the debate over president bill clinton’s pending impeachment inquiry resulting from an affair with a white house intern the host posed this typical “mclaughlin

conservative commentator patrick j buchanan and washingtonbased journalist and editor morton kondracke — thrived in this corral they often shouted over each other to present their opinions “next to ‘mclaughlin’ all the rest of the shows are ‘mister rogers’ neighborhood’ ” clift once said while mr mclaughlin was seated at the center of his show’s set his politics favored the right he once described himself as a “cryptorepublican” and gave the show something that tv guide critic john weisman in  deemed noteworthy — “ ‘the mclaughlin group’ is the only political show seen nationwide that favors the political right” he said on the strength of its host’s bouncing jowls and nonstop barking the show roared in its early years and into the s in  for instance it was broadcast on  pbs stations not to mention three nbc stations for a total viewership of  million it was the highestrated public affairs show in the country’s top  markets according to an account from the new york times mr mclaughlin cherished his celebrity he told a times interviewer in  “walking down th street in new york a car goes by and an yearold kid opens the window and shouts ‘wronnng’ ” from that cultural perch “the mclaughlin group” lost relevance in more recent years in part because of the emergence of the fox news channel — which launched in  — and because of the host’s advancing age as an octogenarian mr mclaughlin was not quite the onair force that his younger incarnation had proved to be the show’s later episodes received attention on the internet primarily when one of its guests made a rude or offensive remark in july  for instance buchanan won a shot of publicity for “the mclaughlin group” when he expressed hope that the united states would not see its first female president until  or  seeing a chance to provoke mr mclaughlin argued that hillary clinton then serving as secretary of state in the obama administration “owed it to her gender” to run for the office in the  election mr mclaughlin’s bombastic style was memorably parodied by comedian dana carvey on “saturday night live” and some of mr mclaughlin’s colleagues contended that the tyrannical fellow whom viewers saw on “the mclaughlin group” was no act a female office manager who worked for the host filed a sexual harassment suit against him that was settled out of court in  kara swisher a mclaughlin staffer who later rose to prominence at the wall street journal was once ordered by mr mclaughlin to make toast after she balked at the command he told her “if i ask you to make toast and you don’t do it i can fire you” a critical look at the “the mclaughlin group” by commentator eric alterman in  decried its “abhorrence of complexity its reductiveness its celebration of nastiness and macho posturing” alterman wrote that it is hard to determine “when john mclaughlin is serious and when he is making fun of himself being serious” the priesthood john joseph mclaughlin was born in providence ri on march   he described his parents of irish descent as “rootedly democratic” his father was a furniture salesman the young mclaughlin attended lasalle academy a christian brothers school in providence it was in those formative years that he built his reverence for the jesuit religious order telling the new york times that it had “a gallantry an intellectual adventurism a style a panache” he began his training for the priesthood at weston college in massachusetts he later received a bachelor’s degree from boston college where he also earned master’s degrees in philosophy and education in the s mr mclaughlin was posted to teaching positions at high schools in massachusetts and connecticut he then secured a transfer to new york city and while pursuing a doctorate in communications at columbia university began working for america the manhattanbased jesuit publication where he became assistant editor mr mclaughlin added another platform to his brand hitting the lecture circuit on topics that often circled back to sex and marriage in  he met his future wife ann lauenstein dore when he was delivering a speech at marymount college in tarrytown ny she was the school’s director of alumni relations over the years mr mclaughlin feuded with the top editor of america the rev donald r campion and left the journal in  it was unclear what prompted the separation but campion issued a lukewarm assessment of his colleague noting that he was fond of “baroque” words “you don’t know quite what they mean but they sort of stun you” the departure from the journal helped clear the way for mr mclaughlin’s brief but highprofile career in us politics he broke with his family heritage by registering as a republican in advance of his candidacy in the  us senate race in rhode island mr mclaughlin took aim at incumbent john o pastore d by running as a “peace” candidate during the vietnam war pastore said mr mclaughlin stuck to “propentagon” policies that were prolonging the war and costing taxpayers their hardearned cash vietnam charged the challenger was “an incredibly bloated expenditure” for his part pastore said at the time that “mclaughlin’s driving me batty how can i debate with a man my religion teaches me to call father” secular success pastore held his office with  percent of the vote mr mclaughlin parlayed his loss at the polls into a professional win — an
