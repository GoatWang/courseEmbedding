swinging macedonia  lp enjabe germany  new copy reissue  add to cart a legendary german session from the s – and a record that really showcases the unusual crisscrossing of modes that was going on in the european scene at the time theres a very strong mps vibe here – as trumpeter dusko goykovich leads a swinging sextet that includes nathan davis on flute soprano and tenor – blowing some tremendously soulful reed lines – plus incredible rhythms from mal waldron on piano peter trunk on bass and cees see on drums the records an attempt to bring traditional macedonian rhythms into a jazz perspective – but with players like these it swings in a way any macedonian album never could – damn soulful and with a great exotic vibe davis is especially great and plays in a soaring modal vein thats similar to his work on his classic mps sides and on the records he cut in america in the early s the albums a beautiful session that often gets overlooked because it blends it with the enja catalog – but its really more of a record that belongs in an mps reissue series and is a great lost groover thats waiting to be rediscovered by the dusty groove crowd titles include macedonia old fishermans daughter jumbo uganda bem basha saga se karame and the nights of skopje lp vinyl record album  mal waldron — all alone  lp gta italy  near mint   add to cart a rare italian solo recording from mal waldron lp vinyl record album japanese pressing back cover has some light wear  mal waldron — quadrologue at utopia  cd tutu germany  used  just sold out add towatch list  cd out of print  mal waldron trio — blood  guts  cd futura france  new copy    add to cart a wonderful session from the time when mal waldron was moving around the world a lot – having a profound influence on national jazz scenes in italy france japan and elsewhere – and turning out great recordings like this this sets got a groove thats a bit more soulful than some of waldrons other trio dates from the time – which could sometimes get a bit outside – and although mals somewhat free on the keys of the piano at points theres a bold sense of rhythm to the record thanks to bass from patrice caratini and drums from guy hayat tracks are long and introspective with almost a randy westonish style – and titles include down at the gills la petite africaine my funny valentine and blood  guts cd  mal waldron with eric dolphy  booker ervin — quest  lp new jazz  very good   add to cart pivotal work from waldron – stepping out of the blowing session mode emerging as one of the s most striking moderinists like a lot of waldrons records from the time this set shows an amazing desire for new forms and modern ideas and the mix of players – eric dolphy booker ervin ron carter joe benjamin and charlie persip – pulls the material in a number of different ways carter plays bowed cello as he did on dolphys out there session and he gives the set a dark moody feel ervins in his best modernist mode and he ably trades lines with dolphy and keeps the whole thing moving nicely waldrons writing and arranging is superb and the tracks feature a lot of weird time structures and unusual modal patterns includes the tracks status seeking warm canto warp and woof and fire waltz lp vinyl record album purple label new jazz pressing with van gelder stamp and deep groove on one side  steve lacymal waldron — herbe de loubli  lp hat switzerland  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list a moody duet record that hearkens back to some of the recordings the pair did in the old days – with lacy and waldron playing lots of monkish lines especially on the side long  minute hooray for herbie which we assume is a tribute to herbie nichols lacys more inside than usual and as with his other piano duet records he shows that hes still a brilliant accompanist with a good talent for sensitive playing that doesnt always show up in his solo albums or his records as a leader side  of the album features two more lengthy numbers herb de loubli and epistrophy lp vinyl record album includes the insert and postcard  mal waldron — black glory  lp enja germany  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list a great trio set from waldrons early s european days of exploration – recorded live with pierre favre on drums and the great jimmy woode on bass the combination of favres free modernism and woodes soulful swing makes for a very interesting rhythm section – and waldron as he often did in this sort of session dominates the proceedings with some moody and introspective work on the piano titles include the call sieg haile mc la gloire du noir and rock my soul lp vinyl record album us pressing cover has a cut corner  mal waldron — left alone  lp bethlehem  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list a beautiful album by mal waldron – recorded in  after the passing of billie holiday and a very loving tribute by waldron who was her accompanist for a number of years the set moves way past the usual holiday songbook mode and features instead a dark batch of tracks two written by waldron – minor pulsation and cat walk – a third written by him and holiday the famous tune left alone jackie mclean plays some fantastic alto sax on the version of left alone and the rest of the tracks are trio tracks played by waldron julian euell and al dreares the set also features one very strange track – mal waldron the way he remembers billie holiday – which is an interview with waldron about billie and sure there were many cashin records after billie holiday died but this is one of the best and it comes from a very legitimate source lp vinyl record album red label pressing with deep groove cover is stained about  inches along the spine hardly visible on front and a half split top seam  mal waldron — les nuits de la negritude – reflections in modern jazz  lp powertree  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list one of the rarest mal waldron albums ever – issued on a tiny label as part of its education series – but a great trio date with george tucker on bass and al dreares on percussion lp vinyl record album great japanese pressing – with obi  mal waldron — whirling dervish  cd universal france  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list bold genius from mal waldron – one of the key recordings he made during his years on the parisian scene in the early s – a time when his talents and power grew tremendously the record has all the righteous promise you might guess from the title – long tracks that are filled with creative energy and strong lines on the piano – delivered in a way thats never too far outside but which is markedly more unfettered than any previous waldron work in the us the rest of the trio here features noel mcghie on drums and peter warren on bass – both very able bandmates and players who help waldron really sharpen his sound titles include reaching out the whirling dervish and walk cd out of print  mal waldron — mal   lp prestige  used  out of stock add towatch list one of the best records mal waldron ever made and a blinding hard bop session featuring a tight quintet with knockdowndead front horn lines the record really follows strongly in the mode of some of waldrons contributions to prestige blowing sessions from the same period – but its also got a much great focus and tightness – one that puts the record right up there with the best hardbop sides on blue note gigi gryce plays some razorsharp alto on the session idrees sulieman is on trumpet and waldrons piano is unusually soulful – with slight modern changes that really keep things interesting tracks include shome transfiguration stablemates and dees dilemma lp vinyl record album s japanese pressing – hard to find in any format  mal waldron — meditations – live at dug  cd victorsomethin cool japan  new copy  out of stock add towatch list a sublime solo performance from mal waldron – the kind of unbridled spiritual work he started giving us once he spent a lot of time overseas – sounds that are light years away from his american records of just a few short years before waldron is incredible here – and his ability to work in different ways with each hand on the piano almost makes it feel as if the performance is a duet instead of a solo – as mal can lay down modal rhythms with one hand create incredible flights on the keys with the other – all while holding onto a sense of rhythm and melody thats completely wonderful throughout unlike some other waldron records of this nature which might go a bit outside – this one is free but never out – and instead has mal opening up beautifully on the titles the blues suite chairo no hitomi the stone garden of ryoanji summertime all alone and left alone cd  mal waldron — complete remastered recordings on black saintsoul note vol  up  downupdatesometimes im bluesempre amorededicationour collinesil  cd black saint italy searly s new copy cd  out of stock add towatch list a fantastic run of work from pianist mal waldron – an artist who was already years ahead of his time when he broke on the scene in the s but never got a chance to fully explore all of his many musical ideas until he formed a strong partnership with the black saintsoul note label in the s this huge set features  different albums each one a slight variation on waldrons talents – all records that are packaged here in individual recordstyle covers – so that you get a cd version of the albums as they originally appeared on the market most of these are more intimate recordings – and the set includes one solo album two duets each with david friesen and steve lacy albums with singers judi silvano tiziana ghiglioni and kim parker – a quartet date with anthony braxton and another with chico freeman – and also one more trio album includes the full albums up  down update sometimes im blue sempre amore dedication our collines a treasure ill be around six monks compositions communique riding a zephyr and remembering mal cd  possible matches   gene ammons — angel eyes  cd prestigeojc  used   add to cart a stone classic from gene ammons – and a record that introduced his talents to a whole new audience in the s the albums a more laidback one than some of jugs more hardblown honkers – as you might guess from his hit rendition of the ballad in the title – and the instrumentation here varies between organ from johnny hammond smith and piano from mal waldron – making for a nice tapestry of darktinged late nite moods other players include frank wess on tenor and flute and art taylor or ed thigpen on drums titles include the classic angel eyes plus you go to my head and its the talk of the town – and slightly more groovin numbers like getting around and water jug cd  gene ammons — big sound  lp prestige mid s very good   add to cart classic jug playing in a laidback openended blowing session with other strong prestige players – like coltrane jerome richardson paul quinichette art taylor and mal waldron who always seems to be the driving force between most prestige sides like this the album has only  tracks and theyre all long and nice and soulful the titles are blue hymn the real mccoy cheek to cheek and thats all lp vinyl record album blue label pressing  gene ammons — blue gene  cd prestige  used   add to cart way more than just an album with gene ammons as a leader – and instead a set that truly earns the all stars listed on the cover – thanks to a great array of supporting players and a very loose openended jam session style that lets everyone get in plenty of solo space ammons tenor is tremendous but hes also a great collaborator here too – working with idrees suliman on trumpet pepper adams on baritone mal waldron on piano art taylor on drums doug watkins on bass and ray barretto on conga – in a mode thats maybe slightly tighter than some of the blowing sessions prestige was doing at the time but which still has that key longform creative energy that made the hardbop generation so great titles include blue gene scamperin blue greens n beans and hip tip – and all tracks are long with plenty of focus on solos cd  gene ammons — jammin with gene – hi fi jam session  lp prestige mid s good   add to cart ahhhh    the jam session years of gene ammons this album was one of a number that jug cut for prestige during the mid s all excellent examples of how perfectly the labels blowing session style could work when it wanted to the set takes ammons tenor and groups it with an allstar cast that includes art farmer and donald byrd on trumpets jackie mclean on alto mal waldron on piano doug watkins on bass and art taylor on drums all the horn players are given free reign to solo – and as most of the tracks go on and on and on they really get room to open up blowing with the kind of competitive creativity youd hear in a live set at the same time includes three long tracks not really the blues jammin with gene and well be together again lp vinyl record album nyc th street label with deep groove and rvg etch cover has a split top seam wear and a few spots of aged tape on the seams vinyl plays with clicks  crackles  donald byrd — body  soul  lp prestigestatus  good   add to cart nice laidback blowing session tracks for prestige ostensibly led by donald byrd and kenny burrell though the label may just have been capitalizing on their names on the cover players include byrd hank mobley mal waldron paul quinichette art taylor and sonny red in a number of different groupings working their way through material like tune up body  soul alicia tea for two and cpw in a relaxed soulful manner with strong emphasis on good solo playing lp vinyl record album blue label pressing cover has moderate wear with some clear tape over splitting seams vinyl plays with clicks  crackles  marc cary — for the love of abbey  cd motema  used   add to cart a beautiful tribute to the late great abbey lincoln – served up on a host of solo piano performances by marc cary – mostly of tunes penned by lincoln herself but also featuring a few originals as well theres a rich vibrant feel to the record – a quality that strikes us stronger than any other cary recording weve heard in recent years even though marcs on his own here – really reaching out on the keys of the piano with a command we never would have expected – stretching over space and tone with a sort of majesty to rival mal waldron or mccoy tyner – yet also keeping things deeply personal as well titles include melancholia down here below music is the magic love evolves down here below the horizon transmute throw it away and who used to dance cd  john coltrane — coltrane prestige  lp prestige  very good   add to cart classic early john coltrane for prestige – less a bold statement as a leader than a strong batch of blowing sessionstyled tracks that show how well coltrane could hold his own with more established players the groups on the set vary from track to track – and feature players that include sahib shihab mal waldron red garland paul chambers and al heath – plus underappreciated philly trumpeter johnnie splawn tranes in great form here – even though the overall sets a bit less structured than some of his later albums – and his tone and solo approach are already stepping out from the rest of the pack with great vigor titles include bakai time was straight street and chronic blues lp vinyl record album yellow  black label nyc pressing with flat edge deep groove rvg stamp and ab etch cover has a lightly bent corner with a thin stain along the spine on back and some aging  john coltrane — dakar  lp prestige  very good   add to cart darkly brooding work from john coltranes early years as a leader on prestige – a very unique little record that features twin baritone sax support from pepper adams and cecil payne both players are wonderfully hip here – more than enough to match tranes unique musical vision for the groups format – and the sound of the session is much edgier than some of his other prestige work – which may be why the label chose not to issue it until  even though it was recorded back in  theres a nice roughness here – the same inspirational early sound youll get on coltranes early sides for savoy or imperial – and other players include mal waldron on piano doug watkins on bass and art taylor on drums titles include cat walk dakar route  velvet scene and witches pit lp vinyl record album german ojc pressing cover has an unglued top seam  john coltrane — more lasting than bronze lush lifecoltrane  lp prestige  near mint lp gatefold   add to cart strong work – even if the album is sort of a collection of tracks that trane recorded for prestige instead of a discreet album the lp set is from the mid s – and combines tracks originally issued on the albums lush life and coltrane side one of lush life features coltranes tenor in a spare setting with earl may on bass and art taylor on drums – playing mellow tunes like i love you and like someone in love as well as the original tranes slow blues side two features a blowing session mode – with donald byrd red garland paul chambers and louis hayes – on the cuts lush life and i hear a rhapsody coltrane is a classic set for prestige – a set of blowing session tracks with trane in the lead featuring players like sahib shihab mal waldron red garland paul chambers and al heath tranes in great form here – even though the overall sets a bit less structured than some of his later albums – and his tone and solo approach are already stepping out from the rest of the pack with great vigor titles include bakai time was straight street and chronic blues lp vinyl record album  john coltrane — wheelin dealerswheelin  dealin  lp prestige  near mint lp gatefold   add to cart a lp set that expands on tunes originally issued on the coltranemal waldron albums the dealers and wheelin  dealin – both featuring material recorded in  with coltrane on tenor and a rhythm section that features waldron doug watkins and art taylor the tracks are openended and very much in the blowing session mode that waldron perfected for prestige – solidly rhythmic and quite cohesive yet also very openhanded in the way that each player is allowed space for solo expression paul quinichette and frank wess perform on  sides of the set and the last one features jackie mclean and bill hardman taking their place includes  takes each of wheelin and dealin plus blue calypso falling in love with love robbins nest and things aint what they used to be lp vinyl record album cover has light wear  eric dolphy — eric dolphy at the five spot vol   cd prestigeojc  used   add to cart searing live work from eric dolphy – part of a series of recordings that set a whole new standard for live jazz recording the record features dolphy going even farther out than on his studio sides from the time – as the record features very long tracks performed by a crack group that includes booker little on trumpet mal waldron on piano richard davis on bass and ed blackwell on drums despite the length of the tracks dolphy isnt as far out as on later european live recordings – but the performance is a great example of his inventiveness within a mainstream structure and the modernist tendencies of both waldron and little shine very brightly in the set the concert was one of littles last and greatest recordings – sometimes billed as a memorial even though he was still alive when it was done – and titles on this volume include aggression and like someone in love cd out of print  eric dolphy — here  there  lp prestige early s very good  just sold out add towatch list sort of a house cleaning album one in which prestige collected together a number of unissued dolphy tracks after his death – but still a strong one and in a way the record features music thats even a bit more farreaching than some of the studio albums on prestige dolphy plays a solo bass clarinet version of god bless the child he plays with booker little and mal waldron on status seeking hes on flute in a quartet with jaki byard on april fool and he plays with a pickup danish rhythm section on an alternate take of dont blame me lp vinyl record album blue label pressing cover has wear stains flaking  taped seams  eric dolphy  ron carter — magic  lp prestige  very good lp gatefold   add to cart excellent prestige double lp reissue that pairs eric dolphys classic far cry lp with ron carters early where set dolphy and carter play on both records and theyre joined by players like jaki byard roy haynes booker little and mal waldron classic genius dolphy material with the tracks rally miss ann far cry saucer eyes and a great version of softly as in a morning sunrise lp vinyl record album cover has light wear  a small stain the bottom right corner  ray draper — tuba sounds  lp prestige  very good   add to cart think what you want about the tuba – ray draper is an incredible talent and probably the only individual to make the instrument work in jazz draper played with both john coltrane and jackie mclean during the late s – and this rare album features him leading a group with mclean on alto mal waldron on piano and webster young on trumpet the sound is quite dark – with the heavyhanging blue notes that youll find on the best late s prestige blowing sessions – and in a way the overall feel is more similar to some of the work that mclean and waldron did together than it is to anything else in other words youre in for a modernist hardbop treat – with lots of rich surprises and a deeply emotional approach to playing that makes the music timeless whatever the instrumentation titles include house of davis terry anne pivot and jackies dolly lp vinyl record album yellow  black label nyc pressing with deep groove rvg stamp and ab etch vinyl has a light warp but play is not affected cover has a small stain on back  ella fitzgerald  billie holiday — ella fitzgerald  billie holiday at newport  lp verve  good   add to cart two of the biggest singers who ever worked for verve records – captured perfectly at the newport jazz festival in  ella fitzgerald steps out with a strong lively groove on the first half of the set – swinging things with a looser more upbeat quality than on some of her mellower verve studio sets of the late s – really grooving it up with small combo backing from the trio of pianist don abney billie holiday also gets some small combo backing too – a hip trio with mal waldron on piano joe benjamin on bass and jo jones on drums – often a bit more laidback than the group on ellas sides but in a great way that helps holiday hit a very intimate sound even before this large audience ella sings this cant be love body  soul april in paris i got a crush on you and airmail special – and billie sings nice work if you can get it what a little moonlight can do my man willow weep for me and lady sings the blues lp vinyl record album verve inc pressing with trumpeter logo and deep groove cover has moderate wear  a fully split top seam  ella fitzgerald  billie holiday — newport years volume  aka ella fitzgerald  billie holiday at newport  lp verve  very good   add to cart two of the biggest singers who ever worked for verve records – captured perfectly at the newport jazz festival in  ella fitzgerald steps out with a strong lively groove on the first half of the set – swinging things with a looser more upbeat quality than on some of her mellower verve studio sets of the late s – really grooving it up with small combo

crush on you and airmail special – and billie sings nice work if you can get it my man willow weep for me and lady sings the blues lp vinyl record album back cover has light staining  mary ann mccall — detour to the moon  cd jubileewarner japan  new copy   add to cart one of the rare few albums from vocalist mary ann mccall – a hell of a great singer and one with a really moody dark style mary anns got all the sad tones and blue hues we love in june christys best work – and she arguably works with even hipper backings too – some inventive small group material that mixes performances by teddy charles on vibes mal waldron on piano and jimmy raney on guitar with some occasional violin and viola – used sparingly and worked into these very offbeat arrangements that make the album unlike anything else we can think of – and every bit as striking as the title and cover tunes include detour ahead blue moon moonlight becomes you moon country east of the sun and the moon was yellow cd shmcd pressing  jackie mclean —      cd prestigeojc  used   add to cart an unusual title but one that refers to jackie mclean in quartet quintet and sextet formation – a growing lineup that develops along the course of the record as new players are added into the mix with a casual almost blowing session approach the set begins with jackies alto set out in spare territory with mal waldron on piano doug watkins on bass and art taylor on drums – plenty of space to solo on sentimental journey and why was i born with sharp changes and deeply soulful tones that really push past the conventions of the tunes – and as the record moves on hank mobley steps in on tenor and donald byrd on trumpet – expanding out the sound for nicelyblown versions ofabstraction confirmation and contour cd out of print  jackie mclean — long drink of the blues  lp new jazz  good  just sold out add towatch list longblowing late s work from jackie mclean – one of his standout sets as a leader from the preblue note years the album features mclean in two different settings – really opening up on side one with a sextet that includes curtis fuller on trombone webster young on trumpet gil coggins on piano paul chambers on bass and louis hayes on drums – in two long takes of a long drink of the blues which features jackie on both alto and tenor side two is a bit tighter with jackie heading up a quartet that includes mal waldron on piano art phipps on bass and art taylor on drums – on tunes that include i cover the waterfront these foolish things and embraceable you lp vinyl record album orange label status pressing with rvg stamp  jackie mclean — tune up fat jazzjackie mclean quintet  lp jubileeroulette late s very good lp gatefold   add to cart a great lp set that brings together both of the jackie mclean albums that were recorded for jubilee in the late s fat jazz is one of the few jackie mclean albums to feature his sextet with ray draper draper was the amazing tuba player who recorded with coltrane and his presence here adds much to the session – as do his two compositions filide and two sons webster young plays coronet gil coggins plays piano and george tuckers on drums also features a recording of youngs millies pad the second session the jackie mclean quintet features a great batch of straight ahead hardbop tracks performed with donald byrd mal waldron and doug watkins the set includes two of jackies best compositions from the s – blue doll and little melonae – plus a great track by mal waldron called mood malody the lps got excellent playing throughout and has a nice dark edge to it that points at mcleans later modernist moments lp vinyl record album cover has light wear  charles mingus — jazz composers workshop  cd savoy  used   add to cart a classic session of modernist jazz – and some of mingus most groundbreaking early work the album was recorded for savoy with  different groups – ones got mingus leading john laporta on alto teo macero on tenor and mal waldron on piano and the other groups a quartet with macero kenny clarke and wally cirillo the set marks a strong shift for mingus – into tightly composed tracks that arc out in complex lines hinting at the ferocity of later years – and it offers a showcase for a strong set of soloists carefully picked to match mingus rich vision titles include gregarian chant rose geranium purple heart transeason smog la and level seven cd also features one bonus track not on the original lp – a previously unissued version of body  soul cut during the same sessions cd out of print  charles mingus — mingus at the bohemia  lp debut mid s very good   add to cart seminal early work from charles mingus – a session that really shows him beginning to work in tightly arranged deeply resonant styles – pushing much more deeply towards the brilliance of the late s the sets recorded with a great lineup that includes mal waldron max roach and the enigmatic george barrow on tenor – and includes a fantastic reading of percussion discussion played here by roach and mingus as a drum and bass duet as opposed to roach solo as on a later version also features the brilliant all the things you csharp a pivotal track in the mingus book and one of our favorites ever by him – plus septemberly work song and jump monk lp vinyl record album original debut pressing label on side a has come detached but is included cover has clear tape on the seams and some light runny ink on back  charles mingus — pithecanthropus erectus  lp atlantic  near mint   add to cart an amazing record – quite possibly one of the greatest jazz albums of all time and a session that has charles mingus stepping boldly forward in a whole new direction the album shakes loose the sometimes tooacademic modern tones of mingus albums from the previous year or two – and unleashes the bold raw emotion that would drive him firmly into the s – a new sense of freedom in music filled with poetry anger joy and life the tracks are all quite long – and played by a sharp quintet with mingus on bass jackie mclean on alto sax jr monterose on tenor mal waldron on piano and willie jones on drums titles include pithecantrhopus erectus a foggy day love chant and profile of jackie the whole thing bubbles over with an anger and intensity that you hardly find in other mingus albums and if youve ever heard a weak mingus album and wondered what all the fuss was about you owe it to yourself to own this one we promise that it will never ever let you down lp vinyl record album nice japanese pressing  max roach — its time  cd impulse  used   add to cart stunning this is a beautiful album thats one of max roachs most powerful recordings and a record thats been the inspiration for countless other imitations over the years roach leads a group with richard williams clifford jordan and mal waldron – and theyre matched with a vocal chorus led by coleridge perkinson who also did the arrangements for donald byrds classic with voices albums unlike those though this sets a damn angry bunch of compositions and the chorus wails away in a loud screaming powerful mode that will blow away any of your preconceptions about the with voices mode the group sings wordless vocals except for one cut which has abbey lincoln singing in the lead and provides a searing backdrop of sound for the bands razor sharp playing every cuts a winner and the whole things a masterpiece titles include the profit its time and another valley cd out of print  frank wess — steamin  lp prestige  very good   add to cart one of frank wess strongest albums from the time – a harderthanusual burner recorded with kenny burrell on guitar plus thad jones trumpet mal waldron piano and rhythm by paul chambers and art taylor tracks are long and very jamming – almost in the mode of the prestige blowing sessions of a few years hence especially when wess is playing tenor titles include count one empty street steamin and blue jelly lp vinyl record album blue label pressing cover has masking tape on all seams and a name in marker labels have some marker  gene ammons — twister  lp prestige late s used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list classic blowing session material from jug – with  long tracks that are all a superb example of how great prestige could be when they wanted to the group is filled with great players – jackie mclean mal waldron idrees sulieman and kenny burrell – and the band plays with a free easy groove that produces some beautiful solos especially from jug titles include cattin the twister four and pennies from heaven lp vinyl record album blue label pressing  kenny burrell — all night long  lp prestige  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list sublime late s hardbop – recorded in the best prestige blowing session mode the record has an incredibly openended feel – as you might probably guess from the track all night long which runs for all of side one and gives all the players included plenty of room to work out their best solo moments members of the group here include kenny burrell on guitar hank mobley on tenor jerome richardson on flute and tenor donald byrd on trumpet and mal waldron on piano – really holding the whole thing together with his dark lines on the keys the groove is laidback but never sloppy – and the spaciousness of side one is matched by  shorter tracks on side two – boo lu flickers and little hankie lp vinyl record album yellow and black label nj pressing with deep groove and rvg etch in the blue tinted cover cover has a split bottom seam held with tape a peeled spot in the top right corner held with tape  some stains  eric dolphy — five spot cafe new york city july    cd giants of jazz  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list searing live work from eric dolphy – part of a series of recordings that set a whole new standard for live jazz recording the record features dolphy going even farther out than on his studio sides from the time – as the record features very long tracks performed by a crack group that includes booker little on trumpet mal waldron on piano richard davis on bass and ed blackwell on drums despite the length of the tracks dolphy isnt as far out as on later european live recordings – but the performance is a great example of his inventiveness within a mainstream structure and the modernist tendencies of both waldron and little shine very brightly in the set the concert was one of littles last and greatest recordings – sometimes billed as a memorial even though he was still alive when it was done – and titles on this volume include fire waltz like someone in love aggression and the prophet cd out of print  eric dolphy  booker little — memorial album – recorded live at the five spot  lp prestige  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list part  to the five spot recordings from eric dolphy – issued here as a memorial to booker little even though little was still alive for the recording the album features especially searing work from dolphy and was part of a series of recordings that set a whole new standard for live jazz recording the record features dolphy going even farther out than on his studio sides from the time – as the record features very long tracks performed by a crack group that includes booker little on trumpet mal waldron on piano richard davis on bass and ed blackwell on drums despite the length of the tracks dolphy isnt as far out as on later european live recordings – but the performance is a great example of his inventiveness within a mainstream structure and the modernist tendencies of both waldron and little shine very brightly in the set the concert was one of littles last and greatest recordings – and titles include number eight and bookers waltz lp vinyl record album ojc pressing cover is lightly bent on the opening  billy harper — awakening  cd marge france  new copy  temporarily out of stock add towatch list one of the firstever albums to feature the tenor talents of billy harper as a leader – recorded at a time when the world was really awakening to his talents – thanks to work with max roach art blakey and lee morgan the album features one of harpers classic groups – with everett hollins on trumpet fred hersch on piano louis mbiki spears on bass and horacee arnold on drums – stretching out with a sense of joy power and righteousness that perfectly sum up harpers contribution to jazz at the time – a new sort of spiritualism allowed by the previous presence of john coltrane – yet voiced in a mode thats all billys own the set was recorded during a great burst of creative energy on the french futura label – at a time when they were recording other excellent american players like ted curson mal waldron and chris woods – all with an approach that makes them just the right match to capture harpers early voice at its best the record features a great version of soran bushi bh – a soulful spiritual number thats one of harpers best compositions – plus the awakening and the superlong cry of hunger cd  teo macero — teo macero with the prestige jazz quartet  lp prestige  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list one of the few s small group sessions recorded by teo macero as a leader – and one of the best maceros probably better known both for his work as an arranger and as a producer of famous albums at bigger labels – but here hes working with a quintet in a laidback vibe that really showcases his talents on the tenor saxophone the sound is quite modern – with teddy charles on vibes and mal waldron on piano – both working in more angular styles with lots of tones and chromes that recall their own best work as leaders at the time and maceros horn cuts through these instruments with a sometimessoulful edge similar to some of the use of tenor in charles mingus work of the period no surprise as macero had worked with mingus titles include whats not polody ghost story please dont go now and just spring lp vinyl record album a stunning original pressing – th street nyc label deep groove rvg etch – and beautiful vinyl front cover looks great – almost perfect save for one spot in the corner – and back has some light aging but no writing  jackie mclean —      lp prestige  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list an unusual title but one that refers to jackie mclean in quartet quintet and sextet formation – a growing lineup that develops along the course of the record as new players are added into the mix with a casual almost blowing session approach the set begins with jackies alto set out in spare territory with mal waldron on piano doug watkins on bass and art taylor on drums – plenty of space to solo on sentimental journey and why was i born with sharp changes and deeply soulful tones that really push past the conventions of the tunes – and as the record moves on hank mobley steps in on tenor and donald byrd on trumpet – expanding out the sound for nicelyblown versions ofabstraction confirmation and contour lp vinyl record album original th street nyc pressing with deep groove and rvgab etch cover is stained about an inch on the spine  jackie mclean — jackie mclean  co – introducing ray draper  tuba  cd prestigeojc  used reissue temporarily out of stock add towatch list a really unique little session from jackie mclean – and one of the few s jazz albums to feature the talents of tuba player ray draper a vastly underrated artist who recorded briefly with mclean and coltrane at the time although the tuba might seem like a heavy instrument to bring into jazz drapers way of handling it is really wonderful – as he works the tubas round warm bassy tunes in a way thats somewhere between a trombone and an acoustic bass – yet which also has some surprisingly light and lyrical moments as well drapers only on about half the albums tracks but his presence on the set is really great – and mclean as usual really shines throughout other players include bill hardman on trumpet mal waldron on piano doug watkins on bass and art taylor on drums – and titles include beau jack mirage flickers help and minor dream cd  jeremy pelt — talented mr pelt  cd high note  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list a sharp set from trumpet player jeremy pelt on high note – backed by jd allen on tenor sax danny grissett on piano dwayne burno on bass and gerald cleaver on drums – the same group that played in the equally great men of honor set its great mix of exciting solos within solid soulfully inclined framework we love it when modern players express themselves creatively and show such dexterous ability in way thats both indebted to and honorable of the s post bop and early soul jazz forbears nice stuff includes pelts own pandoras box all my thoughts are of you when the time is right only and david and goliath – plus paradise lost in love again and mal waldrons pulse cd cdr promo copy punch through barcode  paul quinichette — on the sunny side  lp prestige  used  temporarily out of stock add towatch list a perfect example of the great skill that prestige had for taking a good ensemble player and putting him into a context that really let him open up in a manner that brought his best points to light in this case quinichettes plucked from basies group and put with a tight bunch of soulful players like sonny red john jenkins curtis fuller and mal waldron – all of whom are very well trained to handle this sort of pickup session well tracks are long and titles include coollypso circles and blue dots lp vinyl record album ojc pressing cover and labels have some marker  harumi ibe — tantei jimusho  kutabare akutodomo  cd cinema kan japan  new copy  out of stock add towatch list think the french new wave had a lock on jazz soundtracks think again because the japanese scene of the s was full of them – including this sublime set from  most numbers here are jazz tracks played by a great small combo – one thats got tremendous energy all the way through the players are unfortunately not credited – but theres great baritone sax vibes hammond and other instrumentation on these numbers – most of which feel more like evocative performances by a group in a small club than they do any sort of standard soundtrack music the whole things beautiful – rich in feeling and color almost like some of the mal waldron or charles mingus soundtrack performances – and the cd features  tracks in all with notes and other information in japanese cd  jackie mclean — jackies pal – introducing bill hardman  lp prestige  used  out of stock add towatch list jackie mcleans got a great pal here – trumpeter bill hardman whod work with jackie in the jazz messengers a year later here the pals are cutting sharp lines in a perfect early hardbop mode – a great prestige session with big bold sound from rudy van gelder and fresh modern tones from the rhythm section of mal waldron on piano paul chambers on bass and philly joe jones on drums both mcleans alto and hardmans trumpet get plenty of space to open up and ring out in a very personal voice – and titles include dees dilemma sublues just for marty and sweet doll lp vinyl record album th street nyc pressing deep groove  rvg stamp cover has some wear aging  splitting vinyl has a very slight warp  plays with some clicks  crackles but is nice and loud overall  jackie mclean — makin the changes  lp new jazz  used  out of stock add towatch list sweet and tothepoint work from a young jackie mclean – the kind of hardburning yet slightlymodern work he recorded best for prestige in the late s the albums a bit of a blowing session outing – with  different group one a sextet with curtis fuller webster young and gil coggins the other a quartet with mal waldron on piano – but thanks to the strong tone and vision of jackie theres a really unified feel to the set and an edginess that makes the whole thing hang together nicely the tracks are long and soulful and recorded with a resonant quality that makes the tunes echo out even more titlesinclude bean  the boys jackies ghost i never knew and chasin the bird lp vinyl record album note poor condition purple label new jazz pressing with rvg etchstamp cover has some wear  aging vinyl plays with clicks  crackles  charles mingus — jazz workshop aka jazz composers workshop  lp savoy  used  out of stock add towatch list a classic session of modernist jazz – and some of mingus most groundbreaking early work the album was recorded for savoy with  different groups – ones got mingus leading john laporta on alto teo macero on tenor and mal waldron on piano and the other groups a quartet with macero kenny clarke and wally cirillo the set marks a strong shift for mingus – into tightly composed tracks that arc out in complex lines hinting at the ferocity of later years – and it offers a showcase for a strong set of soloists carefully picked to match mingus rich vision titles include gregarian chant rose geranium purple heart transeason smog la and level seven lp vinyl record album in the diecut cover including the heavy inner sleeve  gene ammons — funky  cd prestigeojc  used  out of stock add towatch list one of ammons classic blowing sessions for prestige with an allstar lineup that includes art farmer jackie mclean mal waldron and kenny burrell the group plays together on  long tracks and in a tight hardbop vein with long soulful solos from every player titles include pint size king size and funky cd  teddy charles — coolin  cd new jazzojc  used  out of stock add towatch list a moody session led by vibist teddy charles – in an amazing style that mixes up some of the hardbop styles of the prestige blowing sessions with charles own modernist love of tone and color the albums got a dark sensibility that really sets it apart from a lot of other prestige albums of the time – heart to best effect in charles unique approach to the vibes but sounding equally great in the piano work of mal waldron and in idrees sulimans lofty trumpet lines other players include john jenkins on alto sax addison farmer on bass and jerry segal on drums – and titles include staggers bunni song of a star the eagle flies and reiteration cd out of print  jason moran — same mother  cd blue note  used  out of stock add towatch list blue note boy genius jason moran rolls forward with another fine set for the label – leading a quartet session with a keen ear for s deep south jazz with groundwork in the blues – without sacrificing the freedom and fervor of bop or more contemporary sounds morans been moving very well for a few years in the comfort of his great trio featuring tarus mateen on bass and nasheet waits on the kit – this time adding a stellar guitar in marvin sewell its only appropriate that the measured piano firebrand would jump back a couple generations after lending his attention to hip hop and electro on the last studio album – and he does so with the same geniune passion and perhaps even more appealing results tracks include gangsterism on the rise jump up aubade g suit saltation ill play the blues for you mal waldrons hot fire waltz field of the dead restin gangsterism on the set and more cd      requests  suggestions  terms of use  security  privacy  about us  contact us   dusty groove  n ashland ave chicago il  usa dgdustygroovecom   dusty groove is a registered
