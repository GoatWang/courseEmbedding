mall advertisement fans and curious onlookers gravitate toward them creating a commotion and in some cases pandemonium smart advertisers strike while the iron is hot knocking on their doors cashing in on their popularity as these demigods turn into big crowd magnets and everyone is going gaga over them companies are scrambling to catch a proverbial star based on ac nielsen’s latest study covering from january to june  last year the top  celebrity endorsers in the philippines are  kris aquino  endorsements  john lloyd cruz  endorsements  carmina villaroel zoren legaspi ryan agoncillo sarah geronimo and vic sotto  endorsements  anne curtis marie lozano michael v and sharon cuneta  endorsements advertisement  judy ann santos and kim chiu  endorsements last april rappler an online news

donald trump  million ryan seacrest  million and britney spears and tiger woods both with  million so you’ve signed a big celebrity as endorser because your brand isn’t moving up in the sales charts and your bottom line is nearing rock bottom is a celebrity the last resort before spending your precious money down the drain ask yourself if you did your homework do you have a good strategy are you delivering the right message how’s your advertising does it stand out from the media clutter or worst are you selling a turkey there’s more to using glamour prestige and fame lent by celebrities to your advertising than meets the eye your product the celebrity “the product the product the product” many advertising greats have repeatedly said this line everything boils down to a good product one that delivers what it says one that makes the competition cringe with envy and in the long run has no option but to improve his a great product is a celebrity it will sell on its own merits its performance is its own testimonial extremely satisfied consumers are its free endorsers advertising a bad product even if endorsed by superman or the sexiest girl or man in the world will not do the trick it will only hasten its demise people will eventually know that by word of mouth it is not good a good product with a celebrity endorser won’t do just as much either remember what your marketing mentors taught you before learn from consumers the very people who buy and use your product know what goes on their minds probe ask talk be one of them what precious insights have you picked from being one of them many marketers oftentimes fall into this trap using celebrity endorsers mouthing manufactured words blindly letting endorsers memorize lines like robots without the heart and soul of a consumer is a waste of time and money today’s consumers are intelligent they’ll know ad campaigns that portray celebrities as consumers of the brand they are advertising tend to be more credible a commercial that uses a celebrity as part of the story to dramatize a brand’s unique selling proposition leaves a good impression it elicits audience empathy an ad that makes a celebrity just pose and smile in front of camera is cold and invites sarcasm people tend to say “so” advertising that makes celebrities as mere decorations or props make people turn to the next page of a newspaper or change tv channels the worst thing that could happen is people remember the celebrities not the brand commercials using celebrities with a sense of purpose are best remembered and talked about when celebrities are depicted like normal human beings people can always relate so the next time you are going to do an ad using a celebrity review your idea consumerizing a celebrity attracts throngs of consumers scrutinize if heshe is going to be relevant to the story want to connect meaningfully to your audience attach celebrities to the concept—not coldly detached from consumers’ hearts and minds choosing a celebrity now that you have a product that will be swarmed by “bees” and in a situation that you have to use a celebrity some tips to consider do research on the celebrity’s likability just because someone is popular pretty or goodlooking doesn’t mean she or he will fit the role you may find that there are skeletons rattling in the celebrity’s closet things that could hurt your brand image later on marketing guru willy arcilla who has worked around the region and the greater china market handling a number of multinational brands says “choose someone who best personifies your brand’s imagery character and values someone who can dramatize your brand’s rational and emotional benefits and most of all someone who genuinely loves your brand uses your product or patronizes your service because credibility is key” “it is like choosing a suit for your wedding day says raymund sison bbdoguerrero copywriter “it should fit perfectly or a disaster totally the celebrity’s image should be right for the brand personality in the same manner as the role of the brand should be appropriate to the endorser’s lifestyle” he says sison also tells us that the brand ambassador should likewise appeal to the market and the market should be able to identify with the celebrity veteran tv commercial director sockie fernandez who has done many celebrity endorser ads says that aside from popularity one should “choose a celebrity that reflects the character and values of the brand you are selling” “credibility is the most important thing after all your brand’s credibility is at stake does the product match the celebrity’s lifestyle there should be truth in advertising” says tv commercial producer desiree pebeasley rolly halagao one of advertising’s most indemand casting directors says “choose your celebrity endorser not only on popularity but also on credibility adaptability and willingness to endorse your brand” halagao explains “a celebrity must be a hot item to ignite buzz among your target the willingness to do the project is a big factor because you may have an endorser who’ll just do it for the money” upside of using celebrities a brand looks real when a celebrity endorses it it shows that it exists people are generally impressionable and would readily identify with the brands celebrities endorse “many people believe that if they buy what celebrities are endorsing they too can be just like them and have a piece of that ‘better’ life” says arcilla if your celebrity prospect can fill the smart araneta coliseum or the arena near the mall of asia without spending too much on promotional gimmicks he or she could be a brand winner sixteenyearold gabby douglas was everyone’s darling after she became the first afroamerican to win an olympic gymnastics gold procter  gamble took advantage and offered her with multimilliondollar endorsement deals so did kellogg’s olympic champions usain bolt jessica ennis mo farrah are now enjoying fat celebrity endorsement fees because of their vastly immense pulling power the bigger risk what happens when endorsers figure in scandals and not so palatable situations when the endorser is ‘tainted’ the chain reaction follows after winning eight gold medals at the beijing olympics michael phelps earned numerous endorsement contracts when photos of him surfaced on the net holding a marijuana pipe att cancelled his endorsement deals tiger woods had juicy contracts with nike until he got into a smoldering domestic scandal relentless bad press rocked his otherwise wholesome persona affecting his image and nike’s as well woods lost major endorsement deals with gillette gatorade and tag heuer after he was found to have been unfaithful to his wife accenture also severed all ties with him confirming he was “no longer the right representative” a british actress told the world she rarely wears makeup while at the same time endorsing a cosmetics brand in  actor alan alda was ibm spokesman but was caught buying a toshiba anheuserbusch oakley and nike announced however that it was sticking with lance armstrong despite the doping allegations hurled on the cyclist in a statement oakley said “it supports athletes who respect and honor the ethics of sports until proven otherwise” but even with these brands standing by armstrong ad age reported “his popularity is going on a spiral downhill” so thinking of using an endorser the payoffs are great the risks even greater but the greatest thing to do is invest on your product first and the rest including celebrities will follow
