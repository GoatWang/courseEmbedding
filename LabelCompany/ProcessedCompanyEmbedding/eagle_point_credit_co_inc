role of each committee are described below under  board committees and meetings  the membership of each committee consists of all of the independent directors which the board believes allows them to participate in the full range of the boards oversight duties the board reviews its leadership structure periodically and the board believes that the current leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the board to exercise informed judgment over matters under its purview and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees or working groups of directors and the full board in a manner that enhances effective oversight the board also believes that having a majority of independent directors is appropriate and in the best interest of the stockholders nevertheless the board also believes that having interested persons serve on the board brings corporate and financial viewpoints that are in the boards view crucial elements in its decisionmaking process in addition the board believes that mr majewski managing partner of the adviser provides the board with the advisers perspective in managing and sponsoring us the leadership structure of the board may be changed at

committee has general criteria that guides its choice of candidates to serve as independent directors there are no specific required qualifications for board membership see   board committees and

experiences and a variety of complementary skills when considering potential nominees to fill vacancies on the board and as part of its annual selfevaluation the board reviews the mix of skills and other relevant experiences of the directors in respect of each current director the individuals substantial professional accomplishments and prior experience including in some cases in fields related to the operations of the company were a significant factor in the determination by the board that the individual is qualified to serve as a director the following is a summary of various qualifications experiences and skills of each director in addition to business experience during the past five years set forth in the table above that contributed to the boards conclusion that an

two standing committees to facilitate oversight of the management of the company the audit committee and the nominating committee audit committee   the members of the audit committee are messrs appleby mcdonald tramontano and weiss each of whom is an independent director each member of the audit committee is financially literate with at least one having accounting or financial management expertise the board has adopted a written charter for the audit committee which was included as appendix a to the proxy statement for the  annual meeting of stockholders filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on april   the audit committee recommends to the full board the independent registered public accounting firm for us oversees the work of the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the companys audit communicates with the independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis and provides a forum for the independent registered public accounting firm to report and discuss any matters it deems appropriate at any time the audit committee is also responsible for establishing guidelines and making recommendations to the board regarding the valuation of the companys investments which are considered when the board determines within the meaning of the  act the value of the companys investments mr weiss currently serves as chair of the audit committee nominating committee   the members of the nominating committee are messrs appleby mcdonald tramontano and weiss each of whom is an independent director the board has adopted a written charter for the nominating committee which was included as appendix b to the proxy statement for the  annual meeting of stockholders filed with the sec on april   the nominating committee periodically reviews the committee structure conducts an annual selfassessment of the board and makes the final selection and nomination of candidates to serve as independent directors the board nominates and selects the interested directors and the officers mr appleby serves as chair of the nominating committee in reviewing a potential nominee and in evaluating the renomination of current independent directors the nominating committee will generally apply the following criteria  the nominees reputation for integrity honesty and adherence to high ethical standards  the nominees business acumen experience and ability to exercise sound judgment  a commitment to understand the company and the responsibilities of a director of an investment company  a commitment to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the board and its committees  the ability to understand potential conflicts of interest involving management of the company and to act in the interests of all stockholders and  the absence of a real or apparent conflict of interest that would impair the nominees ability to represent the interests of all stockholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of an independent director the nominating committee does not necessarily place the same emphasis on each criteria and each nominee may not have each of these qualities as long as an existing independent director continues in the opinion of the nominating committee to satisfy these criteria we anticipate that the nominating committee would favor the renomination of an existing independent director rather than nominate a new candidate consequently while the nominating committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders to serve as independent directors the nominating committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the board or a committee and it determines that the selection of a new or additional independent director is in the companys best interests in the event that a vacancy arises or a change in membership is determined to be advisable the nominating committee will in addition to any stockholder recommendations consider candidates identified by other means including candidates proposed by members of the nominating committee the nominating committee may retain a consultant to assist it in a search for a qualified candidate the nominating committee has not adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying individuals for election as independent directors but the nominating committee will consider such factors as it may deem are in the best interests of the company and the stockholders such factors may include the individuals professional experience education skills and other individual qualities or attributes including gender race or national origin consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders   the nominating committee will review and consider nominees recommended by stockholders to serve as independent directors provided that the      recommending stockholder follows the procedures for stockholders to submit nominee candidates as set forth in the companys bylaws and nominating committees charter and summarized here any stockholder recommendation for independent director must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of rule a under the exchange act to be considered by the nominating committee in evaluating a nominee recommended by a stockholder the nominating committee in addition to the criteria discussed above may consider the objectives of the stockholder in submitting that nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all stockholders if the board determines to include a stockholders candidate among the slate of nominees the candidates name will be placed on the companys proxy card if the nominating committee or the board determines not to include such candidate among the boards designated nominees and the stockholder has satisfied the requirements of rule a the stockholders candidate will be treated as a nominee of the stockholder who originally nominated the candidate in that case the candidate will not be named on the proxy card distributed with the companys proxy statement a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the applicable annual meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of the companys bylaws may submit nominations for independent director pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary to be timely the stockholders notice must be delivered by a nationally recognized courier service or mailed by first class united states mail postage or delivery charges prepaid and received at the

must be received by the secretary not later than the close of business on the later of x the ninetieth  th  day prior to such annual meeting and y the seventh  th  day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made such stockholders notice to the secretary shall set forth i as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or

unanimously recommends that you vote for the approval of the new advisory agreement if the proposal is not approved the current advisory agreement will remain in effect as compared to the current investment advisory agreement dated june   by and between the company and the adviser the current advisory agreement the new advisory agreement would  reflect the changes in the structure of the company since the company commenced operations including that the company has issued classes of securities other than common stock  clarify the description of the methodology for how the compensation of the adviser is calculated and specifically provide that any portion of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest will be paid to the adviser without interest only if and to the extent the company actually receives such interest in cash  clarify the application of the  act voting standards to the stockholder vote requirement for approval of the annual renewal as applicable termination or amendment of the new advisory agreement and  make certain other immaterial changes the other material terms of the new advisory agreement would remain unchanged from the current advisory agreement the complete text of the new advisory agreement is attached as appendix a to this proxy statement summary of the current advisory agreement services   subject to the overall supervision of the board the adviser manages the daytoday operations of and provides investment advisory and management services to us under the terms of the current advisory agreement the adviser  determines the composition of our portfolio the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes  identifies evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make including performing due diligence on our prospective investments  closes and monitors the investments we make and  provides us with other investment advisory research and related services as we may from time to time require the advisers services under the current advisory agreement are not exclusive and both it and its members officers and employees are free to furnish similar services to other persons and entities so long as its services to us are not impaired the current advisory agreement was most recently reapproved by the board in may  a discussion regarding the basis for the boards approval of the current advisory agreement is included in our semiannual report for the period ended june   duration and termination   unless earlier terminated as described below the current advisory agreement will remain in effect if approved annually by the board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities including in either case approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of any party to such agreement as such term is defined in section a of the  act the current advisory agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment the current advisory agreement may also be terminated by us without penalty upon not less than  days written notice to the adviser and by the adviser upon not less than  days written notice to us indemnification   the current advisory agreement provides that absent willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations the adviser and its officers managers partners agents employees controlling persons members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages      liabilities costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement arising from the rendering of the advisers services under the current advisory agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser management fee and incentive fee   we pay the adviser a fee for its services under the current advisory agreement consisting of two components  a base management fee and an incentive fee the base management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals an annual rate of  of our total equity base total equity base means the net asset value nav of our common stockholders and the paidin capital of our preferred stock these management fees are paid by our common stockholders and are not paid by holders of preferred stock or the holders of any other types of securities that we may issue base management fees for any partial calendar quarter will be appropriately prorated the base management fee does not increase when we borrow funds but will increase if we issue additional shares of preferred stock in addition we pay the adviser an incentive fee based on our performance the incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals  of our preincentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter subject to a hurdle and a catch up feature no incentive fees are payable to our investment adviser in respect of any capital gains for this purpose preincentive fee net investment income means interest income dividend income and any other income including any other fees such as commitment origination structuring diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from an investment accrued during the calendar quarter minus our operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee expenses payable to the administrator under the administration agreement the administration agreement between us and the administrator and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock but excluding the incentive fee preincentive fee net investment income includes accrued income that we have not yet received in cash such as the amount of any market discount we may accrue on debt instruments we purchase below par value as well as any such amounts received or accrued in kind preincentive fee net investment income does not include any capital gains preincentive fee net investment income expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is compared to a hurdle of  of our nav per quarter for such purposes our quarterly rate of return is determined by dividing our preincentive fee net investment income by our reported net assets as of the prior period end our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the calculation of the total equity base which is used to calculate the  base management fee the incentive fee is paid to the adviser as follows  no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our preincentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of  of our nav   of our preincentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such preincentive fee net investment income if any that exceeds the hurdle but is less than  of our nav in any calendar quarter we refer to this portion of our preincentive fee net investment income which exceeds the hurdle but is less than  of our nav as the catchup the catchup is meant to provide the adviser with  of our preincentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income meets or exceeds  of our nav in any calendar quarter and   of the amount of our preincentive fee net investment income if any that exceeds  of our nav in any calendar quarter is payable to the adviser that is once the hurdle is reached and the catchup is achieved  of all preincentive fee net investment income thereafter is paid to the adviser      you should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our investments accordingly an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to the adviser with respect to preincentive fee net investment income the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest such as paymentinkind interest or original issue discount will be paid to the adviser without interest only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash and any accrual will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any writeoff or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable and would result in a reduction of the incentive fees for such quarter there is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate no incentive fee is payable to the adviser on capital gains whether realized or unrealized in addition the amount of the incentive fee is not affected by any realized or unrealized losses that we may suffer the payment of monthly dividends on our preferred stock including on any shares of preferred stock that may be held by officers or other affiliates of the adviser is not subject to preincentive fee net investment income meeting or exceeding any hurdle rate the following is a

company has issued classes of securities other than common stock  clarify the description of the methodology for how the compensation of the adviser is calculated and specifically provide that any

other immaterial changes the other material terms of the new advisory agreement would remain unchanged from the current advisory agreement as discussed further in the section entitled board consideration of the new advisory agreement the board believes that the new advisory agreement is in the best interest of the company because the changes being proposed would update the terms of the current agreement to reflect the current operations and structure of the company more precisely and clarify certain potential existing ambiguity in the current agreement and would not alter the fee rate or amounts paid to the adviser changes reflective of changes in company structure   the new advisory agreement reflects that the company has issued classes of securities other than common stock including the preferred stock and a class of debt securities by referencing these types of securities where appropriate throughout the new advisory agreement this clarification does not result in any substantive changes to the terms of the new advisory agreement adviser compensation   for its services the adviser would continue to be entitled to receive a base management fee and incentive fee from the company each of these fees will continue to be calculated in the same manner as calculated under the current advisory agreement the new advisory agreement clarifies the description of the methodology for how the compensation of the adviser is calculated in this regard the new advisory agreement clarifies the methodology for calculating the base management fee in that it specifically provides  the timing in which the base management fee is calculated each calendar quarter  that the base management fee is based on amounts as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and  that the base management fee is adjusted      to the extent any common stock or preferred stock is issued or repurchased during a given quarter the new advisory agreement also clarifies that interest expense paid on debt will constitute an operating expense for purposes of calculating the incentive fee the new advisory agreement also specifically provides that consistent with current practice  any portion of the incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest such as paymentinkind interest or original issue discount will be paid to the adviser without interest only if and to the extent the company actually receives such interest in cash and  any accrual of such deferred interest will be reversed if and to the extent such deferred interest is reversed in connection with any writeoff or similar event the new advisory agreement also specifically provides that the adviser may to the extent permitted by law elect to defer all or a portion of its fees for a specified period of time these changes serve to clarify the terms that describe the methodology for how the compensation of the adviser is calculated and more specifically describe the treatment of certain earnings and deferrals these changes do not alter the fee rate or the methodology pursuant to which the fees are currently calculated under the current advisory agreement the total fees payable under the new advisory agreement will remain the same as fees currently payable under the current advisory agreement stockholder vote requirements   the new advisory agreement clarifies that the vote required to approve the annual renewal as applicable termination or amendment of the agreement is a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the company as defined in section a of the  act section a of the  act defines the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company as the vote at the annual or a special meeting of the security holders of such company duly called a of  per centum or more of the voting securities present at such meeting if the holders of more than  per centum of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy or b of more than  per centum of the outstanding voting securities of such company whichever is the less these changes clarify any ambiguity as to what vote is required where the voting standard is not stated in the current agreement with specificity board consideration of the new advisory agreement at an in person meeting held on february   the board including all of the independent directors voting separately unanimously voted to approve the new advisory agreement by and between the company and the adviser for an initial oneyear period and to recommend approval of the new advisory agreement by the stockholders the board considered that the new advisory agreement will not take effect unless the new advisory agreement is approved by the stockholders the board considered that as compared to the current advisory agreement the material terms of the new advisory agreement would remain unchanged except that the new advisory agreement would  reflect the changes in the structure of the company since the company commenced operations including that the company has issued classes of securities other than common stock  clarify the description of the methodology for how the compensation of the adviser is calculated and specifically provide that any portion of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest will be paid to the adviser without interest only if and to the extent the company actually receives such interest in cash  clarify the application of the  act voting standards to the stockholder vote requirement for approval of the annual renewal as applicable termination or amendment of the new advisory agreement and  make certain other immaterial changes the board considered that these changes would update the terms of the companys advisory agreement to reflect the current operations and structure of the company more precisely and clarify certain potential existing ambiguity in the current advisory agreement the board further considered that these changes would not alter the fee rate or amounts paid to the adviser the board further considered that at a meeting held on may   in conjunction with the boards annual review of the current advisory agreement the board including all of the independent directors had unanimously voted to continue the current advisory agreement the board considered that in reaching a decision to continue the current advisory agreement it had considered all the factors the board believed relevant including among other things the following  the nature extent and quality of services to be performed by the adviser  the investment performance of the company and the adviser  the costs of providing services to the company  the profitability of the relationship between the company and the      adviser  comparative information on fees and expenses borne by other comparable registered investment companies or business development companies and as applicable other advised accounts  comparative registered investment companies or business development companies performance and other competitive factors and as applicable those of other advised accounts  the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the company grows and  whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of the companys investors the board considered assurances from the adviser that the approval of the changes contemplated under the new advisory agreement would not have resulted in any material changes to the nature extent and quality of services provided to the company including the investment process or strategies employed in the management of the company and the daytoday management of the company and the personnel primarily responsible for such management or to any of the factors and information the board had previously considered the board also considered assurances from the adviser that the adviser was aware of no additional developments other than the changes contemplated under the new advisory agreement and not already disclosed to the board since may   that would be a material consideration to the board in connection with its consideration of the new advisory agreement the board also considered that notwithstanding the initial term of the new advisory agreement the board would conduct an annual review of the new advisory agreement at its meeting to be held in may  during which it would again consider the factors and comparative information noted above based on its evaluation of the information reviewed and the factors detailed above the board reached a determination through the exercise of its business judgment that the terms of the new advisory agreement including the advisory fees paid by the company are fair and reasonable in light of the services to be provided to the company by the adviser and other factors considered that the adviser has served in the best interest of the company and its stockholders as its investment adviser that the terms of the new advisory agreement are suitable to the companys business purposes and investment objectives and that the new advisory agreement should be approved and recommended for approval by stockholders the boards decision to approve the new advisory agreement was not based on any single factor but rather was based on a comprehensive consideration of all the information discussed above and provided to the board at its meetings throughout the year the board did not assign relative weights to the factors considered by it as the board conducted an overall analysis of
