aug   featured angie stout aug   featured angie stout case study — ebrevia case study the following was published in the july 5 issue of the law journal’s legal tech newsletter and is written by christopher s edwards an attorney in the corporate practice group at reitler kailas  rosenblatt llc in manhattansmart technology mitigates the diligence bottleneckdue diligence is an integral and essential part of corporate transactions yet for lawyers and their clients it can be a painful process in mergers and acquisitions and other dynamic and timesensitive transactions due diligence often becomes a bottleneck that slows down deals a frustration to attorneys and their clients alikeas a corporate attorney at reitler kailas  rosenblatt llc a midsized firm in new york city diligence is a vital part of my work in mergers and acquisitions and venture capital transactions  working solo or with colleagues i typically conduct due diligence by reading through thousands of pages of a target company’s dense and complex contracts looking for problematic provisions and summarizing key concepts  depending on client needs the work product i often generate for each contract i review is a summary template which essentially consists of a table in word specifying which provisionsinformation i am looking for and a corresponding summary of each of those respective provisions in the given document  sometimes these summary templates are passed along to a client attached to a diligence memo  other times they are used internally to generate the diligence memo  clients with their focus on costs are always receptive to ideas we have for ways to work through the diligence process more efficiently and as their counsel i want to help keep costs to a minimumin addition accuracy remains of paramount importance – after all diligence is essential to evaluating the risks and benefits of a transaction  i am eager to use time most efficiently doing what i do best – analyzing the results of the review in order to negotiate and execute deals on behalf of my firm’s clientsin researching solutions to expedite and improve the diligence process i came across ebrevia a software company founded by harvard law school graduates and a computer scientist that applies an artificial intelligence technique called “machine learning” to contract review and abstraction  ebrevia’s software extracts relevant information for attorneys using a natural language processing methodology developed at columbia university  i was intrigued by the company’s unique application of this cuttingedge technology to the law as i think that adopting technology to improve how we serve our clients is key to the future of law practiceelegant interface powered by sophisticated technologyebrevia’s diligence review tool called the diligence accelerator is impressive  the user interface is elegant and logical with only a brief demo and overview from the company i used the software intuitively and with confident ease  ebrevia allows attorneys to select key provisions for extraction from an extensive list of concepts typically relevant in due diligence for mergers and acquisitions  the remarkable and gamechanging aspect of ebrevia’s technology is that it searches for concepts rather than just keywords and then extracts the relevant concept no matter where it is located in the document and regardless of the vocabulary used to express it  for example an important provision in ma such as change of control can be expressed using language like “change of control” “assignment by operation of law” or “merger”  of course in a merger agreement the word “merger” could be used a hundred times with just one of them applicable to the change of control concept  this is where ebrevia’s artificial intelligence provides substantial advantages over a simple keyword search  essentially knowing what to extract for a given concept and what to leave behindafter the attorney edits the extracted provisions and selects additional provisions from the source document as needed by a simple right click ebrevia’s software generates a summary template  this summary template looks very much like the diligence summaries we typically prepare for internal use or produce to clients  ebrevia works quickly – the software can analyze a batch of fifty documents in less than a minutecloud hosting allows the company to easily scale when large volumes of documents are being processed  as a user this means i never have to wait long to see my results  in addition because the software is constantly getting smarter i’m always able to take advantage of the latest version when i log in  importantly ebrevia is hosted on toptier cloud providers that pass regular security audits and employ militarylevel access controls  documents are protected with the same highly secure protocols as found in leading virtual data rooms including  bit endtoend ssl encryption in transitebrevia in actionafter seeing a demo of ebrevia’s software i decided to put the diligence accelerator to the test on an actual deal  my fellow attorneys at reitler were receptive because of our streamlined approach and the fact that our clients many of them sophisticated technology companies themselves are always enthusiastic when we proactively adopt technological solutions to offer more efficient legal serviceson this deal we needed to analyze a new client’s entire corporate structure and business history on a very tight deadline for a highly complex mergerso on a saturday morning at the office i accessed ebrevia easily by logging in through the company’s website  the majority of documents i uploaded to ebrevia’s system using a simple drag and drop feature were scans  the system’s optical character recognition software automatically converted the scanned documents to text so they could be analyzed as i later saw even though a number of the scans were of poor quality the system’s artificial intelligence technology was still able to extract applicable concepts despite the fact that not all characters converted correctly  many of these concepts would have been missed by a keyword search for example where the word “assignment” on a poor quality scan gets converted as “ossignment”i selected provisions to analyze from a long list of provisions relevant in mergers and acquisitions such as change of control provisions and terms of key customer contracts and selected batches of documents to analyze at once  within seconds the diligence accelerator had extracted the concepts i was looking for into summary templates for me to review  the system also provided me with a chart overview that quickly showed me which documents contained which of the provisions i had selectedtaking each document in turn i reviewed the summary templates clicking on an icon next to each piece of extracted text to see the relevant language highlighted in the source document this helped provide me with context for the information i was summarizing generally speaking the diligence accelerator abstracted exactly the text i would have chosen to copy and paste for a diligence summary i was able to perform free text editing within the interface after clicking on another icon this allowed me to add my own notes and summarize the extracted text still further the process fit naturally into my due diligence workflow and provided me with options to easily remove text from the summary template as well as add additional text from the source document  for example for some provisions i found that the diligence accelerator had been more comprehensive than i deemed necessary so i simply deleted text using a trash icon  using ebrevia’s split screen i quickly read through the source document looking for any dealspecific terms  being an overly cautious lawyer i also doublechecked the reports that the program produced against the original diligence documents and it accurately captured the relevant provisions of the documentsonce satisfied with my review of a given document i changed the its status to “review complete”  my team and i repeated this process for all of the documents in the deal intermittently we would export our work to microsoft word  the result was a clear and cleanly formatted table containing the provisions exactly as excerpted and editedusing ebrevia’s software i was able to save about twothirds of the time in my review  this allowed me to devote more time to the higherlevel analysis and negotiation of the deal  the deal was moving quickly and we were under a tight deadline so using the software also helped to save a weekend that i would have otherwise had to allocate to the reviewebrevia brings tangible benefits to the practice of lawincorporating ebrevia into my law practice offers three principal benefitsincreased speed and efficiency — expedited document review brings muchneeded efficiency to my practice  it allows me to get deals done more quickly  in addition clients welcome the lower bill for due diligence but remain happy to pay fees for where i add the most value namely the higherlevel work of drafting and deal negotiationincreased accuracy — i offer my firm’s clients paramount accuracy even when i conduct diligence manually  however ebrevia allows me to offer the same rigorous accuracy level much more quickly because i start with a culled set of provisions enhance or edit the abstracted text and review the source document for what the software may not have pulledmarketing appeal — my firm’s clients many of whom are eager and early adopters of technology themselves have been extremely receptive to my using automation software and proactively seeking technological solutions to practice more efficientlywith its diligence accelerator and additional solutions specifically designed for other practice areas ebrevia’s technology has great potential to have a transformative effect on corporate law  i am pleased to be an early adopter and proponent keeping legal practice and my firm’s clients at the forefront of technology that will streamline and improve legal serviceschristopher s edwards is an attorney in the corporate practice group at reitler kailas  rosenblatt llc in manhattan he provides counsel to a variety of companies from startups to publicly
