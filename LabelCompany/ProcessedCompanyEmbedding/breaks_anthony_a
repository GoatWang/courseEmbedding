poses for a portrait next to a photo of her daughter caylee ap more on casey anthony casey anthony says itd be dumb to have another kid casey anthonys dad my heart hurts even more now judge in casey anthony trial speaks out about verdict aaron hernandez meets with casey anthonys lawyer west palm beach fla — casey anthony knows that much of the world believes she killed her yearold daughter despite her acquittal but nearly nine years later she insists she doesn’t know how the last hours of caylee’s life unfolded “caylee would be  right now and would be a total badass” she told the associated press in one of a series of exclusive interviews but discussing caylee’s last moments the yearold anthony spoke in halting sober tones “i’m still not even certain as i stand here today about what happened” she said “based off what was in the media” — the story of a woman who could not account for a month in which her child was missing whose defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony — “i understand the reasons people feel about me i understand why people have the opinions that they do” this was the first time anthony spoke to a news media outlet about her daughter’s death or her years since the trial her responses were at turns revealing bizarre and often contradictory and they ultimately raised more questions than answers about the case that has captivated the nation it’s been almost nine years since caylee went missing and six since the circuslike orlando trial that ended in her mother’s acquittal the trial was carried live on cable networks and was the focus of daily commentaries by hln’s nancy grace who called her “the most hated mom in america” and derisively “tot mom” the child was supposedly last seen on june   she was first reported missing by casey anthony’s mother on july  a day later casey anthony was arrested on charges of child neglect she told police that caylee had disappeared with a baby sitter a utility worker working in a wooded area near the anthony home on dec  found skeletal remains that were later determined to be caylee’s experts would testify that air samples indicated that decaying human remains had been present in casey anthony’s trunk casey anthony appears in court during her trial in ap in the end prosecutors proved casey anthony was a liar but convinced the jury of little else the government failed to establish how caylee died and they couldn’t find her mother’s dna on the duct tape they said was used to suffocate her after a trial of a monthandahalf the jury took less than  hours to find anthony not guilty of firstdegree murder aggravated manslaughter and aggravated child abuse she was convicted of four counts of lying to police though two counts were later dropped and served about three years in prison while awaiting trial she admits that she lied to police about being employed at universal studios about leaving caylee with a baby sitter about telling two people both of them imaginary that caylee was missing about receiving a phone call from caylee the day before she was reported missing “even if i would’ve told them everything that i told to the psychologist i hate to say this but i firmly believe i would have been in the same place because cops believe other cops cops tend to victimize the victims i understand now … i see why i was treated the way i was even had i been completely truthful” at the trial lead defense attorney jose baez suggested that the little girl drowned and that casey’s father george anthony helped cover that up — and sexually abused his daughter her father has vehemently denied the accusations asked about the drowning defense casey hesitated “everyone has their theories i don’t know as i stand here today i can’t tell you one way or another the last time i saw my daughter i believed she was alive and was going to be ok and that’s what was told to me ” ap anthony lives in the south florida home of patrick mckenna a private detective who was the lead investigator on her defense team she also works for him doing online social media searches and other investigative work mckenna was also the lead investigator for oj simpson when he was accused of killing his wife and acquitted anthony said she’s become fascinated with the case and there are “a lot of parallels” to her own circumstances an associated press reporter met anthony as she protested against president donald trump at a palm beach rally it’s unclear why anthony agreed to speak to the ap she later texted the reporter asking that the ap not run the story among other things she cited the bankruptcy case in which she has been embroiled since  “during the course of my bankruptcy the rights to my story were purchased by a third party company for k to protect my interests without written authorization from the controlling members of this company i am prohibited from speaking publicly about my case at any time” in addition she said she had violated a confidentiality agreement with her employer and remains under subpoena and subject to deposition in her bankruptcy case casey anthony takes photos at the morikami gardens in delray beach flaap yet she had participated in five ontherecord interviews over a oneweek period many of them audiotaped she still dreads the supermarket checkout line for fear she’ll see photos of her daughter on the cover of tabloid papers her bedroom walls are decorated with photos of caylee and she weeps when she shows off her daughter’s colorful fingerpainted artwork occasionally she goes out with friends to area bars but news that she is there spreads quickly people whisper and snap photos and she retreats to her newly purchased suv so she can return home alone anthony speaks defiantly of her pariah status “i don’t give a s— about what anyone thinks about me i never will” she said “i’m ok with myself i sleep pretty good at night” share thisfacebooktwittergooglefacebook

told wftv that he believes anthony accidentally killed her daughter with chloroform during the trial evidence was presented that showed anthony researched using chloroform which was once used as an inhaled anesthetic during surgery“the most logical thing that occurred in my eyesight based on everything i know about the case was that anthony did not intentionally kill her daughter” perry told

daughter to die”anthony who currently lives at the house of a private investigator who worked on her case told ap she is currently helping him with some investigative workand despite the fact she can

certain as i stand here today about what happened anthony says   ap photojoshua replogle view  more images newser – almost nine years after her yearold daughter caylees death—and six years after she was controversially acquitted of murder and child abuse—casey anthony has broken her silence about the girls death in an interview with the ap im still not even certain as i stand here today about what happened the yearold says in an interview that the ap says contained revealing bizarre and often contradictory answers that raised more questions than answers about caylees death some highlights caylee would be  right now and would be a total badass anthony says id like to think shed be listening to classic rock playing sports and taking no nonsense she says anthony once labeled the most hated mom in america says she knows many people still think she killed caylee based off what was in the media—the story of a woman who could not account for a month in which her child was missing and whose defense involved an accidental drowning for which there was no eyewitness testimony—i understand the reasons people feel about me i understand why people have the opinions that they do anthony says anthony sees herself as alice in wonderland with the public as the red queen the queen is proclaiming no no sentence first verdict afterward she says i sense and feel to this day that is a direct parallel to what i lived my sentence was doled out long before there was a verdict sentence first verdict afterward people found me guilty long before i had my day in court on her drowning defense anthony says everyone has their theories i dont know as i stand here today i cant tell you one way or another the last time i saw my daughter i believed she was alive and was going to be ok and thats what was told to me anthony admits lying to police about details including leaving caylee with a babysitter and telling two people the girl was missing but she believes she would have ended up on trial even if she told the truth because cops believe other cops cops tend to victimize the victims she says adding cops lie to people every day im just one of the unfortunate idiots who admitted they lied anthony lives in the home of a private investigator who worked on her case and employs her to do investigative work she says she plans to go skydiving for her st birthday—and is happy despite her pariah status i dont give a s about what anyone thinks about me i never will she says im ok with myself i sleep pretty good at night the interview was one of a series that anthony granted to an ap reporter she encountered at an antipresident trump rally in palm beach fla she later asked the reporter not to run the story citing among other things the fact that the rights to her story had been sold to a third party during bankruptcy proceedings in  prohibiting her from speaking publicly about the case the judge who presided over anthonys murder trial thinks he knows what really happened
