could cause the companys actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company including the risks specified in the companys most recent form k and other sec filings so on this mornings call im going to first take you through our results for the first quarter and then im going to turn the call over to jeff to make a few comments we will then both take your questions our sales and earnings in the first quarter were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our annual guidance of a comp owned plus licensed sales decline of  to  and earnings per share of  to  excluding retirement plan settlement charges and premiums on debt repurchases this includes the approximately  per share gain expected on the sale of the union square mens building that will be booked in the fourth quarter remember that we sold this building in january and received the cash at that time sales in the first quarter were  billion down  from last year on a comp owned plus licensed basis sales were down  and down  on an owned basis the back half of the quarter performed better than the first sales in the quarter continued to grow doubledigits in the digital channel while the sales performance in our stores were consistent with our expectations the sales declined versus last year the southwest region based out of los angeles was strongest and the northeast region was weakest international tourist sales declined at about the same rate as our comp sales meaning it didnt have an impact we had hoped however that the uptick we saw in the fourth quarter would help us in  by family of business our sales were strongest in womens apparel most notably active and dresses in fine jewelry fragrances womens shoes furniture and mattresses weaker businesses in the quarter included handbags fashion jewelry and watches housewares and topoftable trends at bloomingdales were similar to those at macys in the quarter bluemercury had a strong quarter with continued successful store openings as well as doubledigit comp growth in the quarter the number of transactions declined  while average unit retail increased  and units per transaction increased  we now have  backstage stores open within our macys stores and are adding  more this year we are encouraged by the performance of these combined stores where the total store sales are being lifted versus control group this performance as well as the results of our last act clearance strategy are both encouraging we see customers liking the everyday deep value opportunity being offered within our mall locations we are testing a few variations of our strategy this year but we believe from our tests so far that this will both add incremental spend from existing customers and also lead to the addition of new customers and whichever model performs best this year will be rolled out aggressively next year the gross margin rate in the quarter was   basis points below last year the decline was due in part to ending  with inventory higher than we had anticipated compounded by weak sales trends in february and margin pressures in a few families of business we are experiencing gross margin declines in the beauty business due to increased promotional activity in housewares due to price competition and in fashion watches due to the strong customer demand and therefore growth in lower margin tech watches while we do not expect to have as much margin pressure going forward due to the inventory level the pressure in these three categories is expected to continue we are working to offset this margin pressure through speeding up our inventory turnover accelerated growth in our private brands as well as from our last act clearance strategy comp inventory at the end of the quarter was up approximately  sga in the quarter was  billion or  million below last year we benefited in the quarter from  million more in asset sale gains compared to last year reduced expense from closed stores and the impact of our restructuring we offset some of the reduced expense with our investment in growing our digital and mobile business and expanding bluemercury depreciation and amortization was  million in the quarter or  million below last year we are pleased with our expense performance and note that it helped to mitigate the gross margin rate decline credit income in the quarter was  million approximately flat to last year credit penetration was  which is  basis points below last year in the quarter but  basis points above  operating income in the quarter was  million down  million from last year or down  million excluding the settlement charges from last years operating income net interest expense in the quarter was  million and tax expense was  million the effective tax rate of  is higher than our annual estimate due to the adoption of the new accounting rule for the income tax effects of stockbased compensation we still expect the annual effective rate to be approximately  during the quarter we repurchased  million of debt in the open market paying a premium of  million approximately  million of this was in our  senior notes due  net income in the quarter attributable to macys shareholders was  million the average share count on a diluted basis was  million shares in the first quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis was  as compared to  per share last year excluding the premiums on debt repurchases the earnings per share was  this compares to last years  per share when excluding settlement charges the cash provided by operating activities was  million in the first quarter as compared to  million last year while there are other variances this can be explained almost entirely by  million lower current income taxes this results from the timing of our first quarter estimated payment which was made in early may this year the net cash used by investing activities was  million as compared to a  million use last year capex including capitalized software was  million lower in the quarter while asset sale proceeds were  million higher we are still expecting our capex to be approximately  million this year so this resulted in cash flow generated before financing activities of  million as compared to a use of  million last year or a  million increase  million of the cash was used as i mentioned earlier to repurchase debt and no stock was repurchased in the quarter on a rolling fourquarter basis our leverage ratio was  and our coverage ratio  this compares to our target range of  to  for the leverage and  to  for coverage let me now update you on the progress in executing our real estate strategy during the quarter we received  million of cash associated with real estate transactions and booked  million of gains  million of the gain was related to downtown minneapolis and  million associated with the brooklyn transaction in addition we sold numerous other properties with lower proceeds as well as gains we are making good progress in selling off properties that were previously closed we are also continuing in our efforts to create additional value from our real estate holdings where we expect to continue to operate as you saw in the release we are now under contract to sell an additional two floors of our downtown seattle store having sold floors five through eight in  after this sale we will operate what we expect to be an even more exciting store on the lower three levels of the building this transaction is expected to close this fall we are very excited by how this project is unfolding and the opportunity that this provides to greatly improve our store there we have also launched a marketing effort for the upper floors of our state street flagship store in downtown chicago this will enable us to operate a more productive store while creating additional traffic from the utilization of the upper floors were excited by the opportunity to make our state street store an even more vibrant shopping destination on our brookfield partnership there is a dedicated team at brookfield who is fully engaged and working in conjunction with our team on feasibility analyses and predevelopment activities related to the approximately asset strategic alliance portfolio we anticipate that we will make significant progress on formulating specific approaches for properties in this portfolio later this year execution would then obviously take us into  and beyond and finally we are in the very early stages of our work to analyze the potential to enhance and energize herald square here in new york so thats an overview of the first quarter as i said earlier it was consistent with our expectations and our outlook for the year remains unchanged were still expecting the annual comp owned plus licensed sales to decline  to  and total sales to decline  to  remember our total sales guidance incorporates a rd week in  while our comp guidance is on a week basis earnings per share excluding settlement charges and premiums on debt repurchases is still expected to be  to  or  to  excluding the gain on our union square mens store i am sure many of you are going to ask about our annual sales guidance given the  decline in the first quarter so i thought i would address that question now we had expected the first quarter to be our weakest quarter of the year primarily because of the rollouts of our strategic initiatives which werent starting until this month and will continue through the second and third quarters also the benefit from closed stores was not expected to help until the goingoutofbusiness sales were completed in late march and while the first half of the quarter was disappointing our trend improved giving us comfort that we are on track we expect the improvement in trend to start in the second quarter and then continue to build in the third and fourth quarters for four key reasons first as i mentioned the benefit from the retained sales from closed stores just started to be experienced now given that the stores are now actually closed we expect this impact to help our comp sales starting in the second quarter second factor is the rollout of our pilots so the rollout of our very successful shoe pilot began may  between now and august we will complete the rollout of the shoe strategy to all stores shoes in the pilot stores produced a nearly doubledigit shoe sales increase in the first quarter well above the shoe sales trend for the rest of the stores and in jewelry we expect to roll out the pilot initiative to the roughly  remaining stores this quarter which will then complete the rollout of that initiative there too weve had very good results that we expect to continue and were also adding or expanding furniture and mattresses in approximately  stores these are all categories of business where we took a new approach to how to operate them and that we saw success in our pilots and are now rolling them out the third factor is our new marketing strategy which will be rolled out in the third quarter which we also expect to help drive our sales as our new chief marketing officer has learned more about macys weve concluded that our current model is too heavily weighted to promotional marketing starting this fall we are evolving to a model that heightens the engagement of our key customers with our brand part of this will include adding communications that will better build our product authority in fashion and in beauty highlighting trends exclusive products and newness we are also evolving our media mix to improve efficiency and effectiveness of our spend and then the fourth factor is on the digital front we continue to improve our mobile app and the digital experience and were also strategizing to improve our buy online pickup in store experience to help us grow this business also remember that in the fall season the digital business which is growing rapidly penetrates higher as a percent of our total sales which then helps the total sales performance due to the mix so with that let me now turn the call over to jeff and then well both take your questions jeffrey gennette  macys inc so thank you karen and good morning everybody im pleased to be here on this call and im going to make a few brief remarks this morning and then well open up the line for qa so firstly these are unusual and challenging times for retail especially for mallbased department stores and we certainly know that these changes that were seeing are secular and not cyclical on the consumer side we see continuing shifts in shopping trends driven by the rapid adoption of technology and for some of our customer segments a greater emphasis on value and on experience as for the retail industry overall weve known for some time that the united states is overretailed compared to other markets so its not surprising to see the contraction in retail square footage and it will take some time to tell how the consolidation and the closure of stores and in some cases entire brands will impact us on one hand we have opportunity to acquire new customers on the other hand this contraction puts more pressure on some of our mallbased stores where we already have seen a slowdown in traffic at macys we have a responsibility to bring additional traffic into these stores and were also going to be working on this in close partnership with our mall developers but we dont have our head in the sand as to the significant challenges that we face in getting the business growing again and were looking outward as well as inward for the solutions and im confident that we will carve out a successful path forward so i want to give you a sense of how ive spent my first few weeks as ceo im really listening to our customers to our brand partners to our associates and to our investors and id like to give you just kind of a highlight and sense of what ive been hearing so let me start with the front line associates so from the front line associates in our stores – so i do unannounced visits to our stores each week and ive been in a lot of our great stores that are performing well and in other stores that are not and when i ask them what help they need and whats working whats working is where we have clear value whats working is where we have exclusivity our customers love that and simple is working when we simplify and build and edit and promote great products that customers can only get at macys that our customers can easily see on the floor we get the sellthrough so a big need and takeaway from this is that we need to continue to make bigger meals out of fewer things for our stores make them easier to shop ive also done a tour of our various cities and town halls with our corporate and support associates and i will just say that theyre very engaged and theyre eager to win again and when i ask them what they need to do to succeed its really loud and clear theyre telling us prioritize give us clear direction and then get out of the way so we can move more quickly they know we need to move at the speed of our customer ive also spent time with our brand partners and theyve told me be macys macys should be the place where customers go for fashion and new ideas and we need to own that lane again they also tell us to go faster our brand partners want us to come with them with great ideas and insights theyre ready to lock arms with us we need to push them to be more creative and them with us and to share combined opportunities through data and innovation and then our investors youve been very clear its how and when will you grow again is whats on your mind and what i want to tell you is that we certainly dont have all the answers yet but we are working on them with a sense of urgency and overall the transition for me has gone smoothly and im grateful to have had the ten months before this to build my core team and get a plan in place that were beginning to address our current challenges but theres certainly more to be done so let me just tell you about  were focused on delivering the plan to support the earnings guidance that we provided for the year and doing that will require us to stabilize our brickandmortar business as well as keep our digital and our mobile business humming on the core business and stores business im pleased with the progress weve made in scaling as karen just mentioned the fine jewelry and womens shoe pilots both will be rolled out nationally theyll both be across the fleet by august and we expect to have a modest but measurable lift on performance in the back half of the year based on them and when were looking at future improvements to stores expect us to apply the same approach of testing in a few number of stores iterating as we expand and then be ready to scale with our learnings nationally in  and beyond weve done a nice job of really this mantra that we have of testing iterating and scale when we get that rhythm right we know we can accelerate our pace of improving the customer experience and driving improved store performance and as karen noted our mobile and our digital business continues to grow at a very strong pace driven in part by a consumer experience that just keeps getting better in particular our mobile app has been recognized as a top retail app and if you havent tried it lately you should we expect to get continued interest and growth through the mobile platform internally we constantly challenge ourselves to deliver on an experience that integrates mobile digital and stores and allows our customers to shop the way that they live  so stabilizing the brickandmortar business and continuing the rapid growth of mobile and digital are key to delivering in  but we certainly know that we will need to go beyond that to find new places for our brand to play and find new sources for growth and that exploratory work is currently underway so as you saw in the release this morning were having an investor meeting on june  where we will take you into more detail of how we were looking at the business as karen just mentioned well provide at that meeting an update on the work were doing to reengineer the macys marketing machine and then were going to spend some time discussing key initiatives that we are in test mode right now that were iterating in  like what karen mentioned with backstage with the intent of scaling those initiatives in  and beyond and at that meeting well also have karen myself and the rest of our senior team will be on hand and available to answer your questions so with that lets open up the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you well pause for just a moment well take your first caller from matthew boss with jpmorgan matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc thanks jeff question on the brickandmortar front and as we think about this overstored retail backdrop domestically i guess what gives you comfort that your th store closure announcement was enough and if sales declines were to continue whats the best way to think about a potential plan b over time jeffrey gennette  macys inc yeah what id say matt is that we looked at the store closures in a couple of ways the first place we looked was the cash flow that each of those stores were giving us and that was more of a gentle pruning that we had done historically the second way that we looked at it would be that if we were building the macys brand from the ground up what dmas what major cities would we be in what key malls would we be in and with the strength of the internet business what stores frankly will we not have built so we felt like we got to that when we made the decision to go aggressively and close and we made the announcement on the  stores we did it thinking that the landscape was such that and the portfolio that remained was the appropriate level of stores across the country but as things go were watching all of this and were watching how the store trends evolve were also looking at are there going to be advantageous opportunities for us where the value of that real estate is greater than the value of the retail that we do there so im not going to say that were not going to close more stores beyond those  but we do feel like we got to the right level when we made the decision that we did in  that were executing now in  matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc great and then just a followup i guess as you size up the decelerating top line performance that weve seen do you think its more companyspecific execution or is it the combination of offprice online some of the category killers i guess the question being now that youve had some time to assess and step back whats the best way that you think to lay out the stepstones to stabilize the business from here jeffrey gennette  macys inc yeah let me take you through that i think that our opportunity is really threefold and then we have a strategy to address it i think the first thing we have to do is we do have to stabilize the core brickandmortar business because still the bulk of our business is being done in our stores while we do that we need to continue the high growth that were experiencing in mobile and digital thats really critical and weve got good wind in our sails on that and we will continue to do all the initiatives to keep that going and the third thing we have to do is we have to explore new territory where we believe our brand can play so let me take you briefly through the strategy to address those topline opportunities three of our fivepoint strategy really focuses on our best customer and really the first piece of that is how we make our brand stronger with a reengineered marketing machine and so youre going to hear about our efforts on that in more detail in june the second of the customerfacing pieces of the strategy are really amplifying the products that she loves and can only get at macys and what were doing with exclusivity and really working through the needs of our customer through the brands that we create or the brands we work with with our partners that are exclusive at macys and the third thing were focused on that are facing customers is the experience and gets to the belly of your questions about reasons why she comes to a store and this is kind of a nexus of technology and the human touch and the experiences that we create in our best stores and those that we create in stores that are of lower tier the fourth point of the strategy is then how we fund all that and were pretty good at that were pretty good at the expense piece we have a real intense focus on cost management and efficiency weve gotten  billion of sga out over the past couple of years and then were clearly showing that we can improve cash flow through our real estate monetization so some of those proceeds are basically helping us invest in those pieces that are customerfacing that will improve our overall business then the fifth point of the strategy is recognizing that those first four points might have gotten it done in a different time but in the time that were in we really havent – we have a fifth point on how were reimagining macys for the future and where does our brand and our consumers give us permission to play how can we transact outside of our store and digital boundaries today what are the new kind of markets and experiences and models that we need to create so were looking outward as much as inward on that we believe that we have the right strategy to achieve what we set out to do for  and though it was a disappointing quarter we are on track to achieve that matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc great good luck guys operator well hear next from kimberly greenberger from morgan stanley kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you karen i wanted to ask about two things i think you said ecommerce or digital commerce is growing rapidly im wondering if you can provide any additional color around that here in the first quarter and then secondarily given your leverage targets in the  to  times range can you talk about some of the strategies and the things that you think macys needs to do to deliver on that and what kind of timeframe we could think about thanks so much karen m hoguet  macys inc sure on the digital growth we said that it was doubledigits in the first quarter increase as ive said repeatedly it is almost impossible to truly break out digital from store given all of the crosschannel activity if somebody is using a mobile phone in store having just worked with a sales associate is that store or digital or the returns et cetera et cetera but the growth continues to be quite strong both mobile in store or digital at home or wherever and as i had said doubledigit growth in terms of the leverage ratio as weve talked about we do expect to continue to reduce our debt levels this year so thats a piece of it but we also expect to grow the ebitda over time so its a combination of working on the numerator and the denominator at the same point and hope to get back in that target range before too long kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks karen could i just add one on the ecommerce is there any change over time in the categories that you find consumers are particularly buying online because i think macys has delivered solid doubledigit growth in ecommerce for a number of years now but are the categories that are growing there the same are you seeing it across the category spectrum or does that change over time karen m hoguet  macys inc no i think kimberly were seeing growth in all categories and it really has not changed over time kimberly conroy greenberger  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you operator next well move to lorraine hutchinson from bank of america lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch thanks good morning karen on the fourth quarter call you had guided merch margins about flat for the year it sounds like there are some challenging categories in the first quarter do you still expect to be able to get that flat merchandise margin or do you think that that will decline for  karen m hoguet  macys inc well in the first quarter the merch margin was down by about the same as the total margin so that was worse than expected although we did offset it on the expense side so all in all the quarter was okay from that perspective i think there will be continued pressure on the merchandise margin as i had said earlier were hoping to offset it and still lead to that flat merchandise margin as we go through the year but were also looking at the expense side too to make sure that if that isnt feasible weve got the opportunity to still do okay on the bottom line jeffrey gennette  macys inc what i would add lorraine is that we had some unexpected fourth quarter overhang in our inventories coming into the first quarter and obviously were dealing with that through the quarter and to what karen talked about in terms of a few categories where we are more challenged with margin that we see to continue were hoping that we have upside in how were building some of our exclusive assortments that are more marginrich and were really focused on making sure that that product is – its got a customer in mind and that the value is there and consistent with what a customer expects and if the benefit of it is that its also enhanced margins then we will take that but were really focused on creating products in our exclusivity portfolio that is really designed for particular customers so far shes responding to those we expect that to help us offset some of the fobs that we dont see improving in overall margin lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch and could you give us an update on cosmetics and maybe talk through what youre doing to stabilize sales jeffrey gennette  macys inc let me talk about that so i think that – lets talk about color and treatment versus fragrances so fragrances our business is quite strong and youve heard us on these calls talk about fragrances being a positive piece of our business that continues so we saw that in the first quarter and when you look at the color and treatment line that is whats under more duress then we have pieces of our business within color and treatment like bluemercury that is quite strong and were getting doubledigit growth out of that we did add bluemercury in two macys stores and like the impulse strategy that macys started about  years ago its taken awhile to get some traction but were starting to see some real firming up of that and that give us confidence that that can be a much bigger play in macys in the future the impulse strategy thats part of color and treatment has been quite strong for us what we will be – were rolling out more of those locations more in the second quarter for the back half of the year and then were working with our branded partners that – on how were going to change the experience or product mix to get better performance out of some of our lines that have not been doing as well in the balance of the beauty strategy so we have many task forces that have been formed on this weve got very smart people that are working on it both on our brand partners side as well as our side and were working towards this we also believe theres an opportunity with loyalty and so were focused on that and we hope to share those learnings with you in that direction when we meet in june at the investor meeting lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator kara szafraniec from northcoast research your line is open kara szafraniec  northcoast research partners llc good morning had a couple of questions on backstage for you guys we are wondering if maybe you could give us just a little more color on how the backstage productivity is in comparison to maybe the rest of the store what categories are working best in that deep value section and any crossshopping commentary you could give us would be great thanks jeffrey gennette  macys inc so ill take that so there is a – let me kind of back up a bit on really what the offprice strategy is at macys it really starts with our customers and we – when you look at our best customers those customers that shop with us up to  times a year twothirds of those shop in offprice on a monthly basis and  of millennials are shopping offprice on a monthly basis so macys needed to solve for that so when we started the backstage concept offmall we got some good returns on that but we also – at the same time we were doing that we also tested backstage in some of our underproductive stores by kind of carving out a big cavity of real estate and putting backstage in there and that – we got some interesting results from that so to get at the heart of your question we really had this real estate that we had excess space where we could add the backstage concept and so then we started to play with what the offering would be and we were very careful about cannibalization making sure that what we put in the backstage section of that store wasnt just cannibalizing what was on the full price side and so that brought for us categories that we werent in in the balance of the store that we could really exploit within backstage so we have a big chunk of the inventory that is not represented in the balance of the store things like home décor a lot of things like toys and things in baby opening price point in certain categories like cosmetics that isnt cannibalizing anything in the balance of the building and what were finding with this is that as karen mentioned that backstage where we have it in a freestanding store – or excuse me when its in a macys fullprice store – that the entire building is lifting by a very nice level and so were looking really now at the customer behavior does that core customer who is coming into those buildings is she going over to the backstage side and is she building up her ticket or her basket on that particular visit that – we checked that box shes in fact doing that the opportunity for that same customer to visit more often as a result of backstage  were looking at that one right now and then the home run will be if you get a new customer that comes into that building because of backstage so weve got a lot of tests out there right now we have four to be precise of the  doors that are going to be fully engaged with backstage in store and were hoping that by the end of this year were going to have a scalable model to aggressively roll out in the future operator kara do you have anything further kara szafraniec  northcoast research partners llc no thank you operator well hear next from paul trussell with deutsche bank paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc jeff welcome and karen good morning thanks for the color youve provided on this call wanted to just circle back on some of your comments regarding initiatives to improve the comp trend over the balance of the year maybe if you can provide a little bit more color around your assumptions for retention from the door closings going on and the potential expected lift to the digital or the remaining stores also if you can maybe just be a little bit more granular on how we should think about the impact of the shoe pilot and the jewelry business more specifically and then lastly jeff you spoke about exclusivity as a real differentiator that the customers are responding to if you can maybe give us some insight into the extent that you may be able to accelerate your offering from an exclusivity standpoint thank you karen m hoguet  macys inc yeah paul on the granularity im not sure im going to be able to help you there its clearly these initiatives though that are going to help us go from our trend in the first quarter to the annual guidance weve given you on the specific subject of retention as weve discussed it varies based on how many other stores are in the market how similar the demographics of the customer is versus the store that closed in the nearby stores as well as other factors that impact that and it can range on a store anywhere from about  all the way up to  or  so again theres not one answer to that but between the retained sales and the pilots as well as the marketing strategy digital et cetera thats why were confident in the annual guidance at this point jeffrey gennette  macys inc and then paul on your other three questions let me take them in order so the first one was on womens shoes and this is one that has been surprisingly good for us shoes have been a real passion category for our customer its one of the two fobs that she comes to us for that really generates – its the first place that she shops and then she stays to shop in the balance of the store so not only if you get shoes right but you also get a customer that is ready and willing to spend in other parts of the building so its a great place for us to focus on and we do believe that womens shoes – that a department store is still the best place for a woman to buy shoes in america so this was a category that we had to get right and it was a category that we were losing share through  and in  so as we do here we have developed a pilot that we tested we learned from that pilot and now were rolling it out to the balance of the country and when we take a pilot we take a pilot that would be a flagship store all the way to a low volume store and test different things so that when we take it into a district or a region of the country we have a scalable model for all types of stores and thats what we did really in womens shoes so we focused on three things within it we really focused on product selection and making sure we had the right brand curation that we really stood for the trends once we took care of the brands we then took an approach of saying okay how do we want to curate it so we then looked at it from a classification lens and instead of having everything by brand we segmented the brands that mattered and everything else basically was then merchandised by classification that got at a lot of editing that we could do that gave us the opportunity with the brands – or the items that remained to really pump up the amount of quantity of size and color that we had so we were ready for any customer in size and color or that we could fulfill from that store then we focused on – so we got the assortment right then the next thing we did is we really focused on experience and we really looked at the amount of management we needed what the back of house had to be what the – amount of sales associates what their commission rates would look like to give them the incentive to work with our customers and then we really looked at that overall model that would say how much of this could be selfserve how much of this could be – needs to be high touch so we played with all that and thats what – we got some nice lifts that karen mentioned and thats what well be rolling out and every store will have some version of this pilot by august of this year so womens shoes we feel very good about a year before that we were really testing everything with fine jewelry and we talked on these calls in the past or karen has about our success with that but what weve seen on that is basically about a double digit increase over control on these fine jewelry stores same thing from flagship all the way to opening price and this is again where weve looked at it from edited assortments we raised the amount and the caliber of the goods some of those branded we made – we said to you that we really wanted to go after the bridal business and as a result of that you needed better salesmanship so we almost doubled the amount of sales associates in a number of our doors we added training we added management we improved the environment we improved the venting and its worked very well so thats what we are now rolling out to the balance of the country and we will have this concept fully involved in every single store by august of this year so thats – its going to be a modest but measurable improvement in the back half of the years trend as it relates to your third question about exclusivity this is one that we can totally control and weve really strengthened the caliber of our teams in private brands and theyve worked deeply over the past year and a half with their suppliers and really worked on the dna of each of the brands that they create and one of the reasons that weve been talking about some more consistent success in the apparel areas is based on the efforts of these private brand teams so they have focused on that weve been able to really work with our supply chain take out weeks of supply weve worked with embedded teams on our side to really work on that and were just getting much faster and the value of the products were now – were able to put more make into these goods were getting higher aurs from these products it helps us stem some of the traffic losses that were seeing in stores because we can get more in aur we can get more in that basket strength because of the strength of these private brands that our customer wanted in addition to that were working with our market vendors so obviously things like tommy hilfiger they have been quite strong weve talked about that the teams that are touching that of our wholesale partners are doing a great job theyre marketing the brands really well and were getting good lifts in tommy hilfiger we made the decision on dkny so dkny now is being made exclusively for us in the deliveries that are coming up in the next number of months and that filled what we believed was white space that we believe is going to give us exclusive product but first and foremost customerwanted product that we werent serving with other brands all of this leads to that were going to be growing exclusivity so if its x percent today expect us to have aggressive growth there we can control it our customers expect it of us it gives us the opportunity to get into a third bucket of growth in exclusivity which is capsule collections so weve had good success with that with y yigal weve got cynthia rowley coming up weve got anna sui at the end of this year all of those we believe cement macys as a place to get fashion to get great – where we can kind of flex our fashion chops so expect us to do that so its going to be a higher percentage in the future with all those things in play and we think that will give us growth in the future at rates accelerating from where they are today paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc thank you and good look operator well move next to paul lejuez from citi paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc hey thanks karen were there any sales in the quarter from the stores that are now closed and if so was there a gross margin impact as well and im also curious about your performance in a b and c malls thanks karen m hoguet  macys inc no there was – the closed – the stores that we closed are not in operations in the first quarter paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc okay karen m hoguet  macys inc and the question is as i said earlier our stores achieved the plan for the year – for the quarter sorry and that i think i havent looked at it quite that way but we feel good about the performance of all of our stores at this point relative to what we had expected paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc okay and then jeff you said something about needing to find new places for growth and that exploratory work was underway what does that mean can you expand on that a little bit jeffrey gennette  macys inc well share that color with you in june well give you some – the beginning – our beginning thoughts on that paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc okay and then last one karen on credit cards can you talk about underlying metrics what you saw on credit during the quarter karen m hoguet  macys inc it was a quarter that was pretty much as expected no surprises i – we were not surprised that the penetration came down a little bit because it had gone up so much last year but really not much change in terms of the portfolio paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc and what was the offset in sga did you share that sorry if i missed it karen m hoguet  macys inc i did and if you give me a minute ill tell you  million which was about flat with last year paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc great thanks guys good luck karen m hoguet  macys inc thank you operator charles grom from gordon haskett your line is open chuck grom  gordon haskett research advisors hi thanks good morning on the digital front theres a little bit of a growing trend of some of the traditional brick and mortar guys buying some customerfacing ecommerce players i was wondering jeff if thats something youre contemplating to not only acquire customers but also some intellectual capital on the digital front karen m hoguet  macys inc i think chuck – its karen obviously not jeff but its something that weve looked at for many years and weve explored this over time obviously havent done anything and we continue to look at all opportunities for helping that business chuck grom  gordon haskett research advisors okay fair enough and then one for you karen back in february you provided i think close to  factors that were embedded in the full eps guidance wondering if theres any significant updates to any of those particularly on the assets on the sales fronts karen m hoguet  macys inc were not updating the details today i think were really focused on the total number in terms of sales and earnings chuck grom  gordon haskett research advisors okay and then just you spoke a little bit about the sequential improvement kohls this morning said that they saw about  basis point to  basis point comp improvement from february to the marchapril period just wondering if that was fairly consistent with the improvement that you guys saw karen m hoguet  macys inc let me answer it a different way which is that our marchapril trend was about a point – a little over a point better than the quarter as a whole chuck grom  gordon haskett research advisors okay okay great thanks and good luck karen m hoguet  macys inc thank you operator operator instruction well hear next from oliver chen from cowen  company oliver chen  cowen and company llc hi thank you jeff regarding the vendor relationships in the context of amazon how do you make sure that you really foster and have the specialness that is required in the marketplace especially as amazon does a good job upgrading their brands or making extremely aggressive efforts along the lines of amazon i know karen youve mentioned youve really ramped up your hiring in terms of big data and using artificial intelligence and amazon has made some strides in voice recognition and is really looking to push fashion so how would you articulate your competitive advantages in that context since a lot of our research shows the majority of americans shop at amazon the other major question i had is speed you speak about speed a lot quite insightfully and you have over a number of quarters just – what needs to happen in the organization and how would you dissect speed in terms of where you think you should go versus now and the capabilities or the changes that the organization needs to undertake to really aggressively tackle speed whether that be fulfillment or procurement thank you jeffrey gennette  macys inc so oliver that was a mouthful so let me take on a couple of what you said let me just say that i think that with respect to the competition lets talk about i think what – theres aspects of the department store that is as relevant today as ever and i think its not a question of what we deliver its really how we deliver so this idea about great products at affordable prices i think that we have – theres many brands that we can control our own destiny and certainly when you get into the exclusivity that isnt going to be in the competition and if thats customerwanted and we can make those a bigger piece of our business we can win so there is – thats how we are focused and i gave some detail about that about the way we were approaching our partners with either capsule or exclusive brands or what we were taking on for ourselves i think that where we intersect as an omnichannel retailer versus where a pure play would be is really the nexus of store and the kind of the social experience of being in a store what were playing with right now is what does a model store have to be for the future that is in a pop mall and what does it have to be in another door so were playing with that we hope that we will have by the end of  a scalable model that really addresses the experience needs of our stores that we can scale to more in the future and then the other piece that we are going to be really amplifying is the role of the store in the community and theres opportunity for us to be a bigger part of the community the community basically is reaching out to us and we to them they want us to be there this opportunity of volunteerism and all of our engagement and our events and our opportunity to bring the community into our stores for richer experiences is how we believe that we can win so its really products experience its community and store while staying very aggressive with digital we use digital right now a lot of customers are using digital to browse and then the opportunity to take some of that demand and move it into the store through bops or buy online pickup in store is another way that we are going to be taking the advantages that we have of the digital customer and moving them into the store by making it advantageous for them to do so so thats how were focused on that another part of your question was about speed i think were – thats one of the biggest mandates of the company right now the thing about speed for us is making sure that everybody is crystal clear about the five priorities of the company and what is their role to lift the strategy so we have spent a lot of time in making sure that everybody is clear on the macys strategy and whats their role and then what are the impediments or roadblocks thats getting in the way of those individuals to lift the strategy in their particular role so weve spent time on reducing process weve obviously in the beginning of the year we reduced a couple of management layers that is helping us but we know we need to move faster we know we need to move at the speed of the customer and we know weve been slow in the past on this so i think that culturally us getting faster and fleeter and pushing the decisions closer to the customer is going to be how were going to succeed so that is a huge priority for me oliver chen  cowen and company llc okay jeff and just a followup regarding backstage the market research clearly indicates its a nice opportunity but a question we receive is regarding vendors and its a different kind of process in terms of how you talk to vendors within an offprice concept versus full price can you brief us on the dynamics there and why this will be a good longterm path and if theres differences we should be aware of and how youre competitively positioned given that uniqueness and also given the uniqueness of the planning and supply chain in the offprice model versus full price jeffrey gennette  macys inc so oliver as you know that if we were approaching the offprice opportunity with the department store headset i dont think we would be as excited about it and i dont think we would ultimately win so we have a separate team that is focused on offprice that is working with our vendors the bulk of that team basically came from the offprice world and we really have segmented them as a piece of the company giving them the resources that they need to really develop that on their own for the needs of that customer as its intersected with backstage being in store were now looking at all of those where a customer traverses between a full price and an offprice business were making sure that were comprehending those influences and what it might mean in cannibalization what it might mean in value what it might mean in terms of classification penetration and what it might mean in terms of new businesses that we need to put into the building and so far all of that is going well so i would tell you that were getting encouraging signs with this the teams are finding the vendors that are very different from the vendor matrix that macys is dealing with and were going to continue to support them so its way too early for us to declare victory on this but at the end of the day we do hope that we will be – we will have a viable offprice concept that is onmall it takes advantage of a still a destination that millions of american consumers come to each and every day they come to a macys now they can come and theres a viable offprice concept we think that could be a competitive advantage for us in that most of our ferocious offprice competitors are offmall right now so we have a lot to learn we dont have hubris on this we are really looking at who the talent is that can help us with this we think weve got a lot of that on our team right now but were still in the learning stages oliver chen  cowen and company llc thank you looking forward to the investor day and appreciate the comments operator moving next to todd duvick from wells fargo todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc good morning karen m hoguet  macys inc hi todd todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc karen im trying to get a sense for what we should expect on the debt reduction front you paid down some debt in the first quarter and i believe you previously outlined a plan to pay off the  million note that matures in july using cash on hand karen m hoguet  macys inc thats correct todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc okay great so for debt reduction beyond this should we primarily expect debt reduction after the holidays when you generate the majority of your cash or are there some larger real estate deals that could result in further debt pay down opportunities karen m hoguet  macys inc yes and yes honestly were not commenting on specific timing but as weve said debt reduction is an important priority for this year todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc okay fair enough thank you operator brett levy from loop capital your line is open brett levy  loop capital markets llc hey guys most of the questions have been answered just i mean in terms of speed i mean have you ever just thought of taking the top three floors of every single store and either selling it or sale lease backing it or something like that and im just kind of getting ahead of a trend karen m hoguet  macys inc well let me answer it this way first off most of our stores are less than three stories so im not sure the question is exactly right but i think what youre saying is should we be shrinking all of our stores in some cases that may be the opportunity and as jeff said weve put backstage into many of these less productive doors so it is in essence using the real estate differently so part of our real estate strategy is in fact looking for opportunities where perhaps a real estate value is greater than the retail and it may involve shrinking other stores for example like weve done with seattle with downtown chicago in terms of the marketing of where were heading in other situations we closed the stores like downtown minneapolis or pittsburgh so theres not one answer but i think we are trying to be realistic in terms of looking at the retail square footage and how to maximize the real estate value jeffrey gennette  macys inc the other piece of it is brett levy  loop capital markets llc what are the usual alternative uses is it residential is it other commercial i mean i think that this sort of a picture of an uber environment of retail space kind of having a lot of residential and a whole bunch of small retail space and that sort of thing is there karen m hoguet  macys inc again you have to split it between the very few but big urban stores that we have like seattle where were putting office space above our stores but in terms of our malls the usage is completely different i mean square footage is more limited similarly with state street were hoping to do the office space as well but most of our stores that are mallbased the square footage that would be freed up is a lot smaller in most cases and the uses would be different brett levy  loop capital markets llc the last question is in terms of the internet or websitebased business youre doing are you feeling like your price points are truly the lowest price points when people actually go to the internet to search jeffrey gennette  macys inc i think it depends on what category youre in i think that were under what we communicated in terms of the housewares category is one that is really being footballed around right now on the net and we are obviously dropping our prices to be competitive we dont want to have like products that are more expensive online or in our stores than our competitors so that is why we have really pushed to make sure that were getting customers value and were really focused on exclusivity because we think we can give them exclusivity and give them great value but not have the same demands of pricing transparency that we do in those things that are more broadly distributed karen m hoguet  macys inc also as a promotional business there are days where our prices are perhaps not competitive if competitor x is on sale and were not but when were on sale we try hard to be as competitive as we can be brett levy  loop capital markets llc all right thanks very much guys operator omar saad from evercore isi your line is open omar saad  evercore isi hey thanks good morning karen m hoguet  macys inc good morning omar saad  evercore isi thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask maybe a little bit more color around the idea of what youre doing in the seattle location keeping some of the store for yourself and monetizing part of the store how do we think about how that space is going to change are you getting out of certain categories in a location like that are you going to kind of basically shrink the footprint of each of the categories that will be really interesting to hear more details around that how you are thinking about it at least thanks jeffrey gennette  macys inc so i think seattle is a great case because we can actually not only shrink but also add categories into that store so its still a very big overall square footage on the three floors that will remain which will be the lower level  and  and it gives us the opportunity to take where we had low dollars per square feet and where we frankly had excess inventory in categories that we didnt need to be able to size that appropriately and also open up spaces to be able to add new ideas new brands new categories so i think seattle is a great example of where we can be much more efficient and get more productive obviously when you are more productive in your square footage your sales associates show up your management is able to manage that better your customers are navigating it with more ease so any time were downsizing a store unless the customer is telling us on that trade area that they dont want a category were looking to retain it and in most cases were looking to add ideas and were doing that either through owned categories or through what we negotiate with our leased partners that give us new ideas that as an economic model that is very attractive to us omar saad  evercore isi got it thats helpful and then if i could ask one followup as we think about the store closures and picking up some of that customer traffic and spend in the remaining locations are you seeing signs in your credit card and loyalty program data that you can migrate those customers to some of the existing locations or online or how do you use that data and that customer relationship that you already have there to make sure you kind of capture as much of that lost revenue as possible karen m hoguet  macys inc yeah one of the things weve done over the last couple of years as weve seen a higher number of store closings coming is that we in fact did take that data to help us both market to the customer but also plan and assort the stores so that if the customer is in a store that was being closed liked a particular vendor that may or may not have been in a nearby store our planning organization was able to bring that vendor into the nearby store so if you had gone back four or five years ago we were not retaining customers or sales to the degree that we are today but by utilizing the data both from a marketing perspective but also frankly as importantly from an assortment perspective has made a huge difference omar saad  evercore isi got it and then if i could sneak one last one in on the new marketing strategy with the new personnel you have their leadership to move away from more of a promotional marketing strategy to more around your product and fashion offering and capabilities do you expect to change the promotional cadence in the business as a result of it or just the way you message it to consumers through marketing and advertising karen m hoguet  macys inc we will forever be a promotional department store so i dont want anybody to say that were going to reduce the amount of promotiality  of this business i dont think well ever see that in any of our lifetimes but it is going to change the messaging and in some cases we over communicate in a certain promotion so we dont expect to reduce the promotional nature of the business this is really going to be reallocating how we spend and how we talk to the customer so that each communication is actually read and can be more effective so dont read this as being less promotional omar saad  evercore isi got it thank you thanks for all the information operator well move next to michael binetti from ubs michael binetti  ubs securities llc hey guys good morning thanks so much for taking our question just a couple of quick ones on – im thinking about the year here on the inventory plan can you just comment on how youre thinking about inventories in the fall maybe in terms of units and then i just want to clarify something you said  karen so the stores that were closed in the quarter were not in the operations reported for the first quarter so i believe those would be a net negative to the continuing operations since they probably drew some attention away from the ongoing stores with an inventory liquidation sale karen m hoguet  macys inc well let me answer the first one while i think about the second so in terms of inventory as we get through the year i think youre going to see the inventory relative to last year come down a bit as we go through the year i cant comment on units but in terms of dollars that would be the case michael binetti  ubs securities llc okay karen m hoguet  macys inc i think that our hope is that as we get through the first quarter not having these stores in the goingoutofbusiness mode will help our business i think thats what you said but im not completely sure but it should help our business as we go forward michael binetti  ubs securities llc okay so maybe a bit of a distraction first quarter  then i guess if we could just kind of think about the im kind of focused on the transactions number here i know we talked about this in the quarter at one point but when we look at the stacks on the transactions that seems to be the area that needs the most urgent attention in very simple terms as you look at the basket of initiatives that you laid out that sound like – many of them sound like it would be very compelling to your customer in particular do you think as those roll out through the year the combination of those are enough to push traffic significantly – or transaction growth significantly better than what weve seen on a oneyear twoyear basis in the first quarter and then i guess just more broadly if we look at some of your strategies again they sound like theyll resonate with your consumer but there is only probably so much you can do with the foot fall at the malls where its at can you maybe discuss your conversations with the reits and what they sound like today what they think about the urgency of the traffic situation and any good ideas you hear that could help maybe from the broader mall karen m hoguet  macys inc yeah i mean look we expect the number of transactions to improve i dont want to get into a debate as to what significantly means but we do expect improvement as we go through the year and were also hoping for help on the aur as jeff has been talking about but again all of that is in the mix of our guidance for the year and i think we and the developers are trying to partner more and more in making our stores and our malls better and so not only attract more people but to have them buy more when theyre there so its really a combined effort there and thats part of why jeff talked about some of the things were doing to make our stores more interesting more exciting and some of it is with services one of the reasons we like bluemercury so much are the spa services that they provide so we are working very hard to think about how to drive customers into our store but also how to convert them one of the things for example were focused on is making checkout easier so that customers can get in and get out one of the things – i think i have talked about this on an earlier call – that we tested last year that was a huge and somewhat surprising success which is that when we originally started the buy online pickup in store we put it as you might imagine retailers would in the second floor in a corner so that youd have to walk through the store to get there and hopefully buy along the way we experimented with moving the buy online pickup in store right at a parking lot door to make it easier for the customer to buy obviously great for customer service but what was interesting is our radiated sales went up significantly and again because we made it easier for her to run her errands and then she felt better about us and bought more so other things like that were doing which will help us convert business more while theyre in the store so long way of saying yes we are doing everything we can with our partners to make our stores in malls better michael binetti  ubs securities llc can i sneak one more in on the model i know you guys have been very generous with your time but on the gross margins in the quarter i think historically weve been very surprised how stable your gross margins have been even in some of the toughest quarters youve had the  basis points of transaction in your mind  are those just the specific categories you called out that came under pressure in the quarter versus historic levels is there something more structural in the composition of mix of the inventory today that changes how we should think about gross margin into the future karen m hoguet  macys inc no i think the bigger part of it related to what i said about the inventory level and not only level but content going into the year combined with the weak february had february been stronger we would have been able to clear a lot more of those goods at a better margin so the combination of the content and the quantity of the inventory at yearend combined with the weak february is a big reason for that  basis point decline michael binetti  ubs securities llc thank you very much operator lindsay drucker mann from goldman sachs your line is open lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning everyone karen m hoguet  macys inc good morning lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co i wanted to ask on the handbag category which you called out as underperforming overall revenue its been a category thats been under some pressure but is there any color you can give us on sort of sequentially whether youre seeing any signs of life there and if you expect to see some improvement there across the year against easier comparisons jeffrey gennette  macys inc id say lindsay its meeting expectations so i think we saw the run rate of what it looked like all through  and thats how we planned it so what you see on this is is that our supply is in line with demand and its less promotional than it was in the past that is really the goals of our manufacturing partners as well as what makes sense for our customer and so thats what were seeing so thats how id comment on it whether or not that continues i think weve got it planned right for the balance of the year lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co sorry jeff just to clarify you had planned it down consistent with  and thats what youre seeing jeffrey gennette  macys inc what im saying is that based on  we planned it as we saw it for  and thats how it is playing out im not commenting that the rate of what we planned it out in  was the same as what we had in  lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co got it okay i think it was the last caller maybe one before you had talked about addressing your coupon strategy and maybe making some changes there i was curious if you had an update for us jeffrey gennette  macys inc well have an update for you at the investor meeting in june lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co okay and then just one last one for me the credit penetration rate in the stores that you closed we had assumed that the credit penetration rate in those stores because less productive stores was lower is that the right way to think about it was the percentage of sales done on credit in the closed stores lower than the fleet that remains karen m hoguet  macys inc i would not think about it that way no lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co okay got it thank you very much operator brian callen from bank of america please go ahead brian callen  bank of america merrill lynch hi karen just a follow up on the debt reduction is the open market strategy what we should expect for the balance of the year and then i guess knowing that you repurchased the s was helpful color can you talk about that decision in terms of looking at high coupon versus low dollar bonds going forward karen m hoguet  macys inc im not going to comment on our strategy for repurchasing debt in terms of timing or how were going to do that going forward i will say that were focused on npv as we analyze these transactions though as our primary driver brian callen  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then maybe a quick followup on the mechanics of leverage given thats such a focus i may have missed this the da dropped in the quarter so the guidance is unchanged on da and then just given the store closures is there a point in  where we start to see rent expense begin to fall or is that really an   type event in terms of the impact on leverage karen m hoguet  macys inc honestly i dont know the answer to the question i have not looked at rent expense lately but we can talk later brian callen  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you operator your last caller in the queue for questions will be priya ohrigupta from barclays please go ahead priya ohrigupta  barclays capital inc great thank you so much for the question ill try to make them quick karen one for you just a followup on again the leverage question as we think about your debt reduction beyond this year to the extent that you do realize proceeds from real estate transactions should we expect that to continue to go to debt reduction particularly if ebitda isnt as strong as you expect and then just a second question is around some of the time that youve been able to take out of your supply chain with regards to private brands can you just provide a little bit more detail on sort of which specific brands youre seeing that in and how broadly that initiative can be rolled out and the total amount of time that can be taken out thank you karen m hoguet  macys inc yeah on the leverage question were aiming for our target range so thats really the only way i can answer that we expect that the ebitda to do what we expect it to do or hopefully better over time and should that not happen well revisit that but i think i would focus on leverage ratio getting back to the target range jeffrey gennette  macys inc and then with respect to the supply chain we really focused on – we started with the inc which is probably our biggest and our best female brand as well as the alfani brand for women im not going to answer the specific about how many weeks we took out but its measurable in both of those brands were now seeing the fruits of the sellthrough by being much closer in and being able to react to consumer trends by getting those products and weve done that through really working at the supplier chain as well as looking at embedded themes so the rest of your question is how much of that do we see we believe that what were learning right now in inc and alfani we can take to all of our private brands and weve already started that work as well as take some of those learnings and work with our vendors who are creating exclusive products for us through their thirdparty wholesale model priya ohrigupta  barclays capital inc great thank you very much operator there are no additional callers in the queue at this time i
