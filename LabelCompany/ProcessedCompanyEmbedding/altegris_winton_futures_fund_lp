“partnership” is a limited partnership organized under the colorado uniform limited partnership act in march   the partnership’s business is the speculative trading and investment in international futures options and forward markets “commodity interests”  the partnership commenced its trading and investment operations in november   under the partnership’s first amended agreement of limited partnership the “limited partnership agreement” altegris portfolio management inc dba altegris funds an arkansas corporation “altegris funds” or the “general partner” serves as general partner of the partnership and has sole responsibility for management and administration of all aspects of the partnership’s business  investors purchasing limited partnership interests the “interests” in the partnership “limited partners” and together with the general partner “partners” have no rights to participate in the management of the partnership altegris funds is registered with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” as a commodity pool operator “cpo” and is a member of national futures association “nfa”  winton capital management limited a united kingdom company acts as the partnership’s trading advisor “advisor”  the advisor is registered with the cftc as a commodity trading advisor and is authorized and regulated by the united kingdom’s financial services authority  effective as of december   altegris funds became a whollyowned subsidiary of genworth financial inc “genworth”  genworth became a principal of altegris funds and altegris futures llc “altegris futures” an affiliate of the general partner in january  altegris investments inc “altegris” an affiliate of the general partner serves as a selling agent of the interests and acted as the partnership’s introducing broker until january   when altegris futures replaced altegris as the partnership’s introducing broker “introducing broker”  altegris futures is registered with the cftc as an introducing broker   the partnership’s term will end upon the first to occur of the following december   receipt by the general partner of an election to dissolve the partnership at a specified time by limited partners owning more than  of the interests then outstanding notice of which is sent by registered mail to the general partner not less than ninety  days prior to the effective date of such dissolution withdrawal including withdrawal after suspension of trading admitted or court decreed insolvency or dissolution of the general partner termination of the partnership pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement or any event that makes it unlawful for the existence of the partnership to be continued or requiring termination of the partnership the partnership is not required to be and is not registered under the investment company act of  as amended   as of february   the aggregate net asset value of the interests in the partnership before redemptions was   the partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries the partnership offers three “classes” of interests class a class b and institutional interests each a “class of interest”  the classes of interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums b           financial information about segments the partnership’s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes — ie  a speculative “commodity pool”  the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services  financial information regarding the partnership’s business is set forth in the partnership’s financial statements included herewith                c           narrative description of business    the partnership is designed to produce longterm capital appreciation through growth and not current income  altegris funds has selected the advisor to trade one of the advisor’s proprietary trading models the winton diversified program the “program” on behalf of the partnership  the advisor currently has the authority to trade the program on behalf of the partnership in all the easily accessible and liquid commodity interests comprising international futures options and forward markets that it practically can which currently consists mainly of commodity interests that are futures options and forward contracts and certain otc products such as swaps in the following areas stock indices bonds short term interest rates currencies precious and base metals grains livestock energy and agricultural products   the advisor’s investment technique in trading the program consists of trading a portfolio of approximately  diversified highly liquid financial instruments traded across numerous futures markets and may also include certain otc instruments and government securities employing a computerized technical principally trendfollowing trading system  this system tracks the daily price movements and other data from these markets around the world and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be to maximize profit within a certain range of risk  if rising prices are anticipated a long position will be established a short position will be established if prices are expected to fall   the trading methods applied by the advisor to trade the program on behalf of the partnership are proprietary complex and confidential  as a result the following explanation is of necessity general in nature and not intended to be exhaustive  the advisor plans to continue the research and development of its trading methodology and therefore retains the right to revise any methods or strategy including the technical trading factors used the commodity interests traded andor the money management principles applied   the program traded by the advisor pursues a technical trendfollowing system  technical analysis refers to analysis based on data intrinsic to a market such as price and volume  this is to be contrasted with fundamental analysis which relies on factors external to a market such as supply and demand  the program uses no fundamental factors   a trendfollowing system is one that attempts to take advantage of the observable tendency of the markets to trend that is to move from one price point to another either higher or lower over a period of time and to tend to make exaggerated movements in both upward and downward directions as a result of such trends  these exaggerated movements are largely explained as a result of the influence of crowd psychology or the herd instinct amongst market participants   the advisor developed the program by relating the probability of the size and direction of future price movements with certain indicators derived from past price movements which characterize the degree of trending of each market at any time   the program follows a primarily nondiscretionary system this means that trading signals are automatically generated by its models and except in extreme situations are followed to the letter the advisor has found that the absence of discretion promotes greater consistency in performance and lessens the opportunity for less reliable anecdotal evidence and personal judgment to influence decisionmaking in unusual market situations the advisor reserves the right to deviate from its automatic system   the advisor will select the type of order to be used in executing each trade on behalf of the partnership and may use any type of order permitted by the exchange on which the order is placed  the advisor may place individual orders for each account it trades or a block order for all accounts it trades in which the same commodity interest is being cleared through the same clearing broker  in the latter instance the advisor will allocate trades to individual accounts using a proprietary algorithm  the aim of this algorithm is to achieve an average price for transactions as close as mathematically possible for each account  this takes the form of an optimization process where the objective is to minimize the variation in the average traded price for each account  on occasion it may direct the clearing broker for the accounts to employ a neutral order allocation system to assign trades   partial fills will be allocated in proportion to account size              the trading strategy and account management principles of the program described above are factors upon which the advisor will base its trading decisions  such principles may be revised from time to time by the advisor as it deems advisable or necessary  accordingly no assurance is given that all of these factors will be considered with respect to every trade or recommendation made on behalf of the partnership or that consideration of any of these factors in a particular situation will lessen the risk of loss or increase the potential for profits    it is expected that between  and  of the partnership’s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums in cash or us treasury department “treasury” securities in the partnership’s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker newedge usa llc “newedge usa” a futures commission merchant “fcm” andor newedge alternative strategies inc “nast” which may from time to time execute spot and other overthecounter foreign exchange transactions as a counterparty to the partnership and available for trading by the advisor in commodity interests on behalf of the partnership  interest on partnership assets held at newedge usa in cash or treasury securities will be credited to the partnership as described under “charges”  depending on market factors the amount of margin or option premiums held at newedge usa could change significantly and all of the partnership’s assets are available for use as margin  the partnership may also retain other brokers andor dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of partnership trades made by the advisor    with respect to partnership assets not held at newedge usa or nast as described above but deposited with wilmington trust company the “custodian” the portion not held in checking money market or other bank accounts and used to pay partnership operating expenses will be invested in liquid highquality shortterm securities at the direction of the custodian or its subadvisor wilmington trust investment management llc an affiliate of the custodian that is registered with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as an investment adviser  the partnership’s custody and investment management agreement with the custodian permits the custodian to invest in us government and agency securities other securities or instruments guaranteed by the us government or its agencies cds time deposits banker’s acceptances commercial paper and repurchase agreements — subject in each case to specific diversification credit quality and maturity limitations  the custodian may use subadvisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement  the general partner may direct that a portion of partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other subadvisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements   the percentage of the partnership’s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the general partner’s sole discretion  the partnership’s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person  depositing the partnership’s assets with banks or newedge usa or other clearing brokers as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes    the partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities expenses and costs  altegris funds receives a management fee of  of the monthend net asset value before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter the “management fee net asset value” of all class a interests  per annum  of the monthend

h           regulation   the cftc has delegated to nfa responsibility for the registration of “commodity trading advisors” “commodity pool operators” “futures commission merchants” “introducing brokers” and their respective associated persons and “floor brokers” and “floor traders”  the commodity exchange act requires commodity pool operators such as altegris funds commodity trading advisors such as the advisor and commodity brokers or fcms such as newedge usa and introducing brokers such as altegris futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements  cftc regulations also require fcms and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital  in addition the cftc and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as “speculative position limits” on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on us commodities exchanges  all accounts owned or managed by the advisor will be combined for position limit purposes  the advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the partnership in order to comply with such limits  any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the partnership  in addition many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row making it impossible for the advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss  currency forward contracts currently are not subject to regulation by any us government agency in addition to such registration requirements the cftc and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities  most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day  in january  the cftc proposed a separate position limits regime for  socalled “exempt” ie metals and energy and agricultural futures and options contracts and their economically equivalent swap contracts  position limits in spot months are proposed to be  of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a nonspot month a percentage of the average aggregate month rolling open interest in all months swaps and futures for each contract  the general partner believes that the proposed limits are sufficiently large that if adopted they should not restrict the partnership’s trading strategy currency forward contracts are not currently subject to regulation by any united states “us” government agency  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “reform act” was enacted in july   the reform act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the overthecounter derivatives markets for the first time  the reform act will mandate that a substantial portion of overthecounter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses  the mandates imposed by the reform act may result in the partnership bearing higher upfront and marktomarket margin less favorable trade pricing and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the partnership the reform act also amended the definition of “eligible contract participant” and the cftc is interpreting that definition in a such manner that the partnership may no longer be permitted to engage in forward currency transactions by directly accessing the interbank market  rather when the reform act goes into effect in july  the partnership may be limited to engaging in “retail forex transactions” which could limit the partnership’s potential forward currency counterparties to futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers limiting on the partnership’s potential forward currency counterparties in this manner could lead to the partnership bearing higher upfront and marktomarket margin less favorable trade pricing and the possible imposition of new or increased fees  the “retail forex” markets could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market  moreover the creditworthiness of the futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers with which the partnership may be required to trade could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which the partnership currently engages for its forward currency transactions  although the impact            of requiring the partnership to conduct forward currency transactions in the “retail” market could be substantial the full scope is currently unknown and the ultimate effect could also be negligible the partnership has no employees   financial information about geographic areas the partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other nonus markets  the partnership does not engage
