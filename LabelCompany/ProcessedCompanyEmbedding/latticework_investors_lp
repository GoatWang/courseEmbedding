 ideas fossil group inc fosl is a vertically integrated from design all the way to pointofsale global consumer fashion accessories company that offers men’s and women’s fashion watches jewelry handbags leather goods belts and sunglasses the current valuation fails to account for the new opportunity that lies ahead of fosl insiders and management own significant stakes ensuring incentives are aligned camera shy ceo kosta n kartsotis owns  of outstanding common stocks and he earns no salary the current share price offers investors the opportunity to buy a good business at a doubledigit normalized free cash flow yield a new trend that arises from smart watches strong currency headwind increased marketing and advertisement related expenses  increase in last  years and increased growth investments led to margin compression but the market fails to recognize the new expansion into the growth markets like china and new product development smart watches based on my sleuthing newly introduced nd generation smart watches q wander  q marshal are sold out in multiple locations st generation watches are no longer available in fossil stores or online via fossil’s website i have received good reviews from sales people they either have the nd generation watch or are planning to buy one in the near future i believe that fosl placed itself in a unique situation to capture the new trend wearable devices that fit technology fashion and fitness altogether although the current market price assumes that the revenue will continue to decline i believe this is not the case for fosl currently the company trades for x ’s fcf new longterm growthrelated investments and liquidation of excess inventory compressed the margin and true cash flow potential as these costs go away margin will expand and so will the fcf historically ebitda margins float around  if the ebitda margin goes to  fosl will generate share implying a  fcf yield the sleuth analyst fosl is one of the highest shorted stocks measured by short interest of float i have been visiting multiple fossil store over the past two weeks i believe wall street is wrong fosl is selling lots of smart watches i have talked to more than  sales associates at different locations they all said the same story good very positive story some stores even ran out of stocks i have talked to customers those who wear them right now they are happy with the generation watches especially about the battery life i also visited the same location multiple times in the past two weeks to talk to different sales people at the same location and i didn’t find any inconsistencies among them httpswwwfossilcomusenproductsqwandertouchscreenrosegoldtonestainlesssmartwatchskuftwphtml rose gold is the most popular among them some locations didn’t even have any stock thesis competitive advantageindustry highlight barriers to entry seem to be low in plain sight but it is hard to break into the industry and run a profitable business operation it is very difficult to grow one brand globally since it is required to have critical mass to have a successful operation a higher startup cost with higher uncertainty doesn’t justify the huge initial investment it is necessary to spend a huge amount of money on advertising to communicate the brand value fosl spends close to  million on advertisement every year it is also necessary to create a brand image even before you start selling through department stores or other channels when the brand goes through distributors the brand will not be able to communicate the image unless it has already been established fols has enough brand names in its portfolio to expand its operation globally fosl’s licensing business is seven times larger than the closest competitor mov it makes fosl a natural partner for other brands guess even tried to join fosl but callanen international guess watch maker sued fosl claiming it violated the antitrust and unfair competition law i don’t anticipate any risk that comes from one brand will leave from fosl to another manufacturer the vertically integrated nature of fossil’s business helps it to understand the new market trend and adapt itself quickly to new fashionstrends it has seven weeks lead time while its closest competitor movado has six months lead time fossil can even run some experimental products which it normally does before producing on a larger scale unlike many of fossil’s competitors fosl sells fashion watches along with luxury watches fashion watches tend to have shorter shelfstore time indicated by the inventory days fashion watches are less sensitive to the economy as compared to luxury watches fosl generates revenue through wholesale  and retail operations  the wholesale business comprises a large portion of ebit having multibrand watches at various price levels has a significant advantage when it comes to wholesale business since department stores are more concerned about how much money they could make per square foot when selling watches they tend to carry all the watches at various price ranges to attract more customers of all levels investment highlights fosl is heavily shorted stock for a variety of reasons i don’t believe that short sellers will continue to be right the threat from the smart watches i think fosl is well prepared to face the new trend their new wearable watches are a very hot product in the market they are close enough to iwatch in terms of functionality even though ios has blocked certain features based on the communication that i had with sales associates it will be rectified through rd party apps in the near future margin compression the market fails to recognize the growth investments an increase in advertising and marketing expenses and currency headwinds i believe the margin will recover as the new investment starts to work out fosl is spending a huge amount of money on expanding its international business as they tend to be high margin businesses rather than the businesses it has in the usa opening new stores tends to cost ebit margin in the short run as indicated by the below graphs i believe sell side analysts are more focused with margin than the possibility that comes in the near future most of the new stores in asia are concession and they don’t have fixed rent payments but rather a  of revenue i don’t believe this will have a negative effect even if the market crashes “our international margins are higher than our us margins on the wholesale side primarily due to the fact that we are afforded the luxury of selling at higher prices we don’t have the same competitive landscape in the watch business in most of the markets internationally as we find here in the us and therefore the — we can price much more sharply our gross margin sort of generally anywhere from probably  to  higher in the international wholesale segment than they are in the us segment on a likeperlike product perspective” – mike kovar – fossil inc – cfo q cct fosl’s new acquisition misfit and the new licensing agreement with kate spade will open up new channels to market its products wearable technology through consumer electronic stores ce misfit and kate spade already have selfspaces in multiple ces even though both of them don’t have good enough products to compete with fitbit management is positive that it will change soon fosl only generates  of its total sales from asia management believes that its recent investment will increase the sales volume in asia where swatch is a market leader fosl has experienced management and it has experience dealing with negative watch demand in fact the company still runs by one of the founders “ for fiscal  mr kartsotis our ceo continued to refuse all forms of compensation expressing his belief that given his level of stock ownership his primary compensation is met by continuing to drive stock price growth thereby aligning his interests with stockholders’ interests as a result the following references to named executive officers in this compensation discussion and analysis do not include mr kartsotis – definitive proxy ” capitalization and multiples with very conservative assumption valuation public comp trades at the lower end of the peer group fosl generates  of its revenue through michael kors brands and  comes from other brands as such i believe fosl should trade above michael kors or at the very least it should trade on par with michael kors if it does fosl would be worth  on a normalized earning basis if it trades at the median fosl will be at  equity fair value under selected valuation scenarios assume the wholesale revenue drops by  conservative base  drop for aggressive case for the sake of conservative valuation wholesale is the higher margin business retail sales flat it is reasonable to assume wholesale ebit margin is  retail margin is  based on historical data evebitx based on peer valuation evebitx based on historical trend aggressive case dcf implied share price sensitivity table implied upside from  sensitivity table conclusion behind all the pessimism that arose from the margin compression and the new smart watch introduction from other companies fosl is trading at a very good valuation analysts are more obsessed with the margin compression and fail to look the possibilities that lie ahead in the future i believe patient investors will eventually reap the benefits my investment thesis on credit acceptance feb   investment thesis cacc is a defensive business with a very solid moat good growth prospects and great capital allocation i don’t think the multiple reflects those qualities – the stock is undervalued cacc trades at a low multiple despite delivering high growth and compounding capital at high rates cacc trades at a  forward earnings yield on an earnings stream that should grow at least in the midteens for the next  years cacc has produced midteen roics for  years and continues to deliver returns in line with historical norms while operating in a neartrough pricing environment suggesting upside to earnings cacc will beat sellside estimates for ntm earnings given trends in unit growth and pricing they grew unit volumes  yoy in q   in q but growth expectations are very modest those volumes will translate to earnings above expectations for the next two years as cacc collects cacc is also underwriting business profitably but is doing so at the low end of its historical rates of return suggesting that current earnings are not representative of the business’s true earnings power potential risks concerns around cacc approaching full market penetration are overstated there is regulatory risk but the potential impact to profitability will likely be marginal not existential in a conservative base case i think cacc should trade at  or  above current value in a bear case i see limited downside given attractive entry multiple defensiveness and continued growth at above market rates over the long term cacc should outperform but if the auto cycle turns meaningfully negative cacc could face temporary growth challenges or increased provisions valuation methodology in a conservative base case key assumptions  drivers are below and a modest multiple for a business growing at least in the midteens i arrive at a value of sh i use x fy eps – a premium to the current multiple but still cheap given per sh growth prospects given growth defensiveness and market position i think a  discount rate is adequate key metrics summary businessmarket overview  investment rationale business  market overview the auto finance market is large fragmented and for most companies very competitive most lenders operate in a highly competitive landscape bidding for business around clear market rates of return based on varying risk profiles cacc is well positioned competitively vs both subscale and established lenders the market is also highly cyclical but cacc has a long history of underwriting discipline the auto loan industry has gone through multiple cycles starting in the early s after cacc’s ipo cacc has been affected by market cycles but it has effectively priced its business throughout cycles cacc can do this because they operate a unique lending model with limited competition key investment drivers dealer holdback is a profitable differentiated model cacc’s model aligns interest between the dealer and the lender resulting in improved credit quality without real competition cacc has pricing power driving attractive roas  roes cacc’s model is much more profitable than peers and requires less leverage cacc has a consistent history of delivering attractive roas  roes but other lenders do not peers trade at bad multiples reflecting the risk associated with their highly leveraged earnings stream which i believe weighs on cacc’s multiple while cacc is very conservatively financed with current spreads cacc’s pricing on their loans near historical lows ltm earnings understate the true earnings power of the business spreads are below their historical norms suggesting cacc’s earnings power isn’t fully reflected in recent results in addition recent growth has been very positive well above that of the past  years which if it continues would drive considerable earnings outperformance cacc is highly cash generative  deploys capital effectively – driving superb results on a per share basis fcf doesn’t reflect true cash generation capability because of high degrees of reinvestment aggressive buybacks  the shares since  amplify already attractive roes and should continue to drive well above market eps growth attractive reinvestment opportunities over the next  years unclear how long the runway will be in the long term but outcomes skew positively cacc has ample nearterm runway to grow – it’s longterm runway will be an inverse function of credit availability in subprime but given that the size of cacc’s tam is inversely correlated to the profitability of low roa highly leveraged peers i think outcomes skew positively over the long term regulatory risk is real but the company is prepared the product is valuable – the market appears to have overcorrected cfpb focus will likely increase costs not eliminate the business cacc is well positioned relative to peers to deal with the potential of more stringent regulation the auto finance market is large fragmented and for most companies very competitive the market for us auto financing is huge  trillion dollars and relatively fragmented particularly in used car lending  of auto loans are for used vehicles  of total loans taken are subprime  fico or deep subprime  fico the market for subprime and deep subprime are bn and bn respectively q  credit acceptance represents a very small portion of the market providing  of total used auto loans and  of the total loan volume for subprime and deep subprime most lenders operate in a highly competitive landscape bidding for business around clear market rates of return based on varying risk profiles competitive riskadjusted rates of return have pressured roas for cacc’s competition cacc is well positioned competitively vs both subscale and established lenders as the regulatory landscape evolves compliance costs will pressure the margins of smaller players many of whom are inhouse financing arms at dealerships that don’t report to agencies in addition to regulatory pressure rising rates will pressure nims for cacc’s established competitors who have much lower roas potentially increasing the demand for cacc’s loans the auto finance market is highly cyclical however cacc has a long history of underwriting discipline and collections execution the auto loan industry has gone through multiple cycles starting in the early s after cacc’s ipo and profitability attracted more capital to the space and while cacc has been affected by market cycles it has effectively anticipated its ability to collect on its loans in the past  years cacc has only overestimated collections by more than  on two occasions  and  reported collections of  and  of expectations respectively note before  the maximum reported collection was  so the average is understated dealer holdback is a profitable differentiated model most lenders underwrite by bidding against one another in competitive auctions after underwriting the dealer is removed from the equation this is problematic because the dealer has no economic incentive to put the customer in a car heshe can afford traditional underwriting is very competitive which results in subpar returns on assets with low roas lenders have to employ significant leverage to generate attractive roes which in a cyclical industry can be dangerous cacc has a unique model that aligns its interests with dealers reducing credit risk on its loans cacc provides an advance on the amount financed principal  interest to the dealer which covers the cost of sale and provides a small profit cacc provides that advance in exchange for the right to collect a  servicing fee on the total collections balance from the dealer’s perspective there is an immediate profit net of the vehicle expense but most of the dealer’s return comes from the customer’s payments on their loan called holdback the dealer is therefore highly incentivized to put the consumer in a car heshe can afford cacc benefits from a significant incumbent bias and effectively no competition cacc is in effect the lender of last resort – they step in for the portion of the population that traditional lenders fail to address this is a very difficult position to disrupt because most of the dealer’s profit is based on a promise – that cacc will service the loan and make payments to the dealer – there is little incentive to move to an unproven player as a lender of last resort cacc has control over its pricing which drives abovemarket irrs and roas on a riskadjusted basis cacc is exposed to the auto cycle to some extent because the size  profitability of their underwriting universe is effectively the vacuum created by traditional lenders within that space cacc has demonstrated the ability to underwrite profitably for  years cacc’s model is more profitable than peers and requires less leverage cacc has a consistent history of delivering attractive rates of return on both total capital and equity capital but other lenders do not the competitive dynamics of the underwriting process have not been favorable to most lending companies but cacc has underwritten profitably throughout the majority of its history cacc is very conservatively financed with both  diverse funding sources spread out over various maturity durations and  significant excess borrowing capacity on many facilities with subpar roas competitors employ significant leverage to deliver favorable roes i see the combination of leverage and cyclicality in the subprime market is dangerous for cacc’s competitors which over time should create opportunities for cacc however applying so much leverage to a space that has been highly cyclical puts those earnings at risk which is reflected in the multiple i believe the poor earnings quality of peers and the associated multiple weighs on cacc’s multiple while most of cacc’s peers’ earnings are peaking and decelerating cacc’s rates of profitability are neartrough and accelerating – i don’t think cacc’s premium multiple reflects that dynamic fully with current spreads near historical lows ltm earnings understate the true earnings power of the business spreads which are a proxy for cacc’s irr on a loan are currently below their historical norm spreads have been somewhat volatile but typically trend within  of the mean the spread return cacc can deliver on its capital is typically an inverse function of the ease of credit in subprime at current spreads a bps improvement in cacc’s incremental spreads a return to the mean would result in a  improvement in earnings power spreads have been somewhat volatile but typically trend within  of the mean operating leverage has put downward pressure on spreads cacc can now write more business at lower rates to the same level of profitability but trends still suggest the business is under earning in addition recent trends demonstrate that growth is not slowing but accelerating which provides visibility to further earnings upside cacc is highly cash generative  deploys capital effectively – driving superb results on a per share basis cacc has there uses for its cash flow providing substantial flexibility in fcf deployment  underwriting extending advances to dealers – the core business  loan purchases buying existing loans and servicing them done when returns are attractive  buybacks cacc evaluates all capital decisions vs the expected return of buying back their stock cacc’s fcf conversion appears weak but only because so much capital is reinvested to grow the business steady state fcf conversion would be close to  implying  fcf margins these three uses of cash present different return opportunities depending on the market environment and cacc has demonstrated the ability to effectively redeploy its fcf cacc’s flexibility in fcf deployment is one of its most important competitive advantages capital allocation track record demonstrated in eps growth and buybacks cacc has bought back  of their stock since  attractive reinvestment opportunities over the next  years unclear how long the runway will be in the long term but outcomes skew positively given the size and fragmentation of the industry cacc still has growth ahead of it at  market share for used car loans the market for subprime and deep subprime finance below  fico score is currently bn or x of cacc’s current book of business bn from this perspective cacc’s runway seems very very long a snapshot of the  subprime abs market demonstrates how small a share of total volumes cacc represents and how important the continued profitability of santander ally and other highly leveraged peers is to shaping cacc’s market opportunity but eventually the pace at which cacc adds dealers will decline as they approach full market penetration however there is ample runway in the near term from this perspective the number of dealers matters because it is through the dealers that cacc distributes their product cacc currently has mm dealers on their network that is out of a total market of dealers of k mgmt points to k as their tam but the real number is probably closer to  of that proportional to the nonprime  subprime market that suggests cacc can only double the dealer base x assuming attrition – more than enough runway for the next few years offsetting the eventual trend in slowing active dealer growth growth in volumeactive dealer should improve over time these volumes should grow above the market for used vehicles driving topline growth volumeactive dealer is highest in markets where cacc has operated the longest demonstrating the value of the product and accelerating utilization over time the full market penetration is a moving target because the size of cacc’s addressable market will fluctuate with the credit environment given that cacc’s value proposition of guaranteed credit approval the size of their market will grow in periods of contracting credit regulatory risk is real but the company is prepared  the product valuable cfpb focus will likely increase costs not eliminate the business this is a high value product – people need cars in america and in addition cacc is one of the few lenders who offer deep subprime borrowers the opportunity to rebuild their credit i see the cfpb closing access to subprime auto financing as unlikely in a nation where you literally cannot live without a car in many geographies the criteria for aggressive lending that have been previously scrutinized center around uncollateralized rollover installment loans – not straightforward asset backed finance equifax an unbiased but influential industry player recently articulated the importance of subprime lending in a study on the industry they also note the dangers of potentially restricting the current industry which could result in less reliable and potentially dangerous sources of credit for consumers in need regulation therefore will likely influence cacc’s cost structure more than its model but robust compliance is already a part of the business having operated in nationwide collections for years – and collections is a very regulatoryintensive industry – cacc has significant experience in working constructively with regulators paired with their scale and anticipation of more scrutiny their model should prove durable to change cacc is well positioned relative to peers to deal with the potential of more stringent regulation if the space were regulated roes for cacc could be pressured but regulation would push lower roa lenders out of business cacc is the only operator who could potentially sacrifice profitability for volume although they haven’t before and are therefore the most resilient to regulatory change small dealers that offer inhouse financing or other small lenders who collectively represent a considerable portion of the subprime market do not report to the credit bureaus and would be more likely targets of regulation increased regulatory scrutiny could actually benefit cacc by impairing margins for subscale or lower roa competition forcing those firms to withdraw products increasing cacc’s tam appendix dealer interviews key takeaways background these are notes from my conversations with dealers following my writeup which was based on public information and conversations with cacc ir i had  conversations in total and  of them were very substantive meaning i had the opportunity to ask all of my questions confirmed assumptions  market is very competitive for loans choosing a lender is a very economic decision dealers have tons of options dealers need cacc when they can’t get financing done through typical providers for most lenders the process is hyper competitive – some have  financing partners dealers think very hard about the value proposition of their financing partners  but with the holdback brandtrust matter  cacc dominates cacc is a very good operator and their brand is valuable the importance of trust speed of execution and collections reliability really matters when using the holdback approach dealers won’t get paid for  years later so the promise from cacc is important cacc has a significant advantage in the holdback market in brand value and pricing trust speed of payment and pricing on brand value cacc appears to be the most trusted name with westlake coming in second then a new company called go in rd cacc pays the fastest and offers the best pricing for depending on inventory generational bias towards cacc old dealers love them – this may be a longterm risk new insights  stickyness cacc’s program model has significant influence on a dealership and improves retention there is a training program and a buying protocol  profitable in any market in any market the cacc program is profitable but in very loose credit markets some dealers think they have a better return on time by working with full credit providers sc ally wfc etc because they can sell vehicle at higher margins  inventory  collateral value a key issue i was unaware of is the importance of appropriate inventory cacc requires that the dealers buy vehicles below average book value to ensure collateral value and minimize their credit risk matching your inventory to cacc’s program cheap us sedans is essential this results in a safer transaction for all parties and ensures the customer gets value in hisher purchase the dealer needs reliable cars quality vehicles bought below book because cacc won’t extend an advance much in excess of book value to ensure they’ll last the life of the loan in addition to the incentive alignment the experience is very controlled and all parties reduce their risk as much as possible including the customer cacc creates margin of safety for the collateral value by controlling the buying habits of its dealers this is unique and reduces cacc’s downside risk materially cacc determines the type of inventory the price you buy and the price you sell this model can be limited if you operate in an suv market where prices are higher  need for high volume if you are not doing a lot of volume it’s not worth the effort to participate because cacc sales are lower margin than fully financed auto sales this can lead to dealer attrition particularly for marginal dealers if volumes can’t meet the fixed costs of working with cacc

about cafepress feb   we sold half of our position in cafepress  the reason for this is we are concerned management may not be able to successfully grow the business and because of that reduced visibility it should be a smaller percentage of the fund  in the most recent quarter cafepress reported its revenues decreased  percent compared to the prior year  we expected revenues to decline when management stopped using unprofitable promotions and discounts to spur demand but the decrease was greater than we anticipated if you recall the cofounders of cafepress returned in  to turn around the business planning to first stabilize the business second optimize it and third grow the business  so far the cofounders have been able to stabilize and simplify the business by cutting over  product types leaving cafepress with its  bestperforming products  this has resulted in improved gross margins of  percent simplified operations and improved free cash flows free cash flow burn rate in the most recent third quarter was  million compared to  million in the previous year  the cofounders are now focused on the second stage of the turnaround which is the optimization phase which can be best described as the phase where the infrastructure is built to grow the business  for example cafepress is making investments in engineering and human resources  although we appreciate the fact that the cofounders are reinvesting in order to grow we are less enthusiastic about the fact that they are hiring new leaders from outside the business which we believe increases risk we also believe its primary competitor zazzle has a better website and better products and have been unimpressed so far with the changes made to the cafepress website and product offerings  all these factors mean that we find ourselves in the position of not being able to forecast what this business will look like in the next five years which means it should represent a smaller percentage of the fund although reduced cafepress still represents  percent of our fund as of the end of the year  one of the main reasons we have not reduced our position further is that most of our purchases were made in february of  and we are waiting until february  in order to classify our taxable gains as longterm  in the interim we believe our downside is protected from the  per share in cash on the balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter stock price at end of year is  per share usseparator this post has been excerpted from a letter to partners of compound money fund lp this document is for informational purposes only

of the third quarter to  percent at the end of the year  we believe strayer has lower growth prospects and as a result trades at a fair valuation  it therefore represented too high a percentage of the portfolio at  percent  we believe it is more prudent to remain on the sidelines and wait to see if growth begins to materialize before committing a larger percentage of our portfolio to this position we also do not see any shortterm catalysts on the horizon we examined job growth prospects in the markets where strayer’s students are located such as washington dc and virginia and saw no dramatic near term job growth that would drive prospective student enrollment within the most common degree plans at strayer we have also become increasingly concerned that the employee culture is exhibiting signs of decline as the leadership continues to emphasize cutting costs instead of growing the business  this is placing pressure on existing employees as many are being asked to take on more work  for example fulltime faculty members are being asked to teach more classes  also many support positions have been eliminated which we believe may have an effect on service quality  we believe layoffs can profoundly affect the culture of the business spreading fear among the remaining employees in the organization  this fear causes companies to contract rather than expand is strayer a mistake as many of you know i have been a champion of strayer for many years writing at length in past quarterly letters about the strength of the investment   my investment thesis was based on the fact that strayer was the best run forprofit education institution and it avoided the bad practices of other forprofit colleges such as recruiting students with false promises and loading them up with debt they could not pay back  i felt many of strayer’s problems were industry related and that its stock price would recover as investors discovered strayer did not engage in the same practices as other forprofit schools then employment growth in the united states began to decline and this along with other factors caused new student enrollments to decline by double digits  this had the effect of shrinking strayer’s total enrollment from  students at the end of  to  students as of the most recent quarter i had underestimated how quickly enrollments would decline but did not want to react too quickly to the negative news and sell the position as new student enrollment stabilized in the last year this gave me further confidence to continue holding our position  we also gave strayer credit for proactively seeking new avenues of growth such as their deal with fiat chrysler and the new jack welch executive mba program  fiat chrysler is paying  percent of the tuition for dealership employees and jack welch executive mba enrollments are growing at a double digit rate both creating more value  in other words we thought that their positive steps were balancing the stagnant enrollment environment i believe in some respects this investment has been a mistake  first i succumbed to the dreaded enemy of all investors – the confirmation bias  this is the bias which causes investors to stick to their existing beliefs  i found myself in a position where i was defending this investment instead of making a detached evaluation   as we invested in higher quality faster growing businesses my comparisons changed and therefore our decision to reduce our position became clearer i continue to have some conviction in strayer but believe the negative attributes may outweigh the positive attributes  this is why i reduced the position size  strayer continues to trade at a double digit free cash flow yield and has an even stronger balance sheet now that it has repaid all of its debt which protects our downside usseparator this post has been excerpted from a letter to partners of compound money fund lp this document is for informational purposes only it is
