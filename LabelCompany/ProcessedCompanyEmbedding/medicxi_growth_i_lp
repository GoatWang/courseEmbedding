things you need to know about growth hacking your startup  shares tags growth marketing services around  founders from our portfolio companies gathered at index in london last week to hear qualaroo marketing gurus sean ellis and morgan brown on growth hacking ellis  who first coined the term ‘growth hacker’ in  and ran early growth marketing at dropbox eventbrite logmein and lookout – has written extensively about why startups when scrambling for meaningful growth need to change the rules of traditional marketing channels or innovate outside them in other words growth hack he kicked off with a caveat “growth hacking is experimentdriven and the things that are working today aren’t going to work tomorrow and things that worked yesterday aren’t working today which is kind of what makes it fun and exciting” there are however some basic governing principles he said “to me being a marketer in an earlystage startup is all about tapping into the full potential of the business “particularly when you are coming from the outside you can be a really good marketer on the wrong product and not be very successful and you can be not that great of a marketer on a good product and do really well so the important thing is to make sure you’re aligned with something that’s got a lot of potential” he said  productmarket fit fundamentally productmarket fit is about having a large group of people who consider your product a musthave ellis explained “not only is it unsustainable to grow a company that doesn’t have productmarket fit also one of the things morgan and i found having analysed not just companies we’ve worked with ourselves  including dropbox eventbrite and logmein  but also by analysing a lot of other companies’ growth engines is that organic growth was the most important growth driver and that’s a direct function of productmarket fit “i boiled productmarket fit down to being able to measure if the product was really a ‘must have’ where i could go in and assess that just by asking users ‘how would you feel if you could no longer use this product’ “what i found was that companies where around  or more of the people said they’d be very disappointed tended to do pretty well and companies with less than  tended not to do very well so it became kind of a benchmark for me as a marketer if i could just get myself into  companies then i would have a much better chance of success and probably get more credit than i deserve” he smiled “that points to the necessity where if you have less than  you should spend all your time trying to figure out who the people who consider your product a musthave are and how to get more of them once i get that right concentration of people then i know how to grow the business i know that that’s the group of people i should be targeting with the benefit that they’re getting and also how i should be positioning the product”  stack the odds the next part of the ‘growth pyramid’ is where factors like conversion rate optimisation the right business model and positioning – essentially the things that optimise the business’s growth engine and user acquisition and retention – come into play ellis continued “this is about reorienting or recalibrating a business around that musthave benefit that the product gives because this is what opens up profitable marketing channels so at logmein we were doing a lot of search engine marketing  spending about k a month  and i was frustrated because we couldn’t scale that spend any more but when i actually looked at our marketing ‘funnel’ the overwhelming majority of people who signed up never actually used our free remote access product at that time “when i mapped the funnel we found we were losing people at each step  including where they came to the website signed up downloaded the software configured firewalls etc   and so i got to the point where i just knew we weren’t going to be able to scale search spending any more if we didn’t fix this”  fix leaks   ellis said he and the ceo then made a decision to devote several months to optimising the logmein conversion funnel “we did all kinds of tests at every step and a lot of qualitative research to find out why people weren’t moving through well and we improved it probably to the point where we had x more people who signed up actually using the product   “while it doesn’t seem like that much of a difference what it meant from a search engine marketing perspective was that that k spend on all the keywords that we tested now scaled to around a million dollars a month and the business was cash flow positive all the way to the ipo i don’t think that would have happened if we hadn’t spent that time stacking the odds”  increase desire decrease friction there are two key levers to use to optimise conversions said ellis “it’s about increasing desire and decreasing friction a basic formula where   desire – friction  conversion rate “so you want to identify all points of friction and anytime you remove friction you’re going to improve conversion rate and anytime you increase desire you’re also going to improve conversion rate you want to work both of those until you essentially start to flatten out in terms of improving that conversion rate” he advised   “growth has multiple levers… you want to make sure you experiment with each of those levers to maximise growth rates when something’s working you really need to understand that double down and squeeze the most out of it”  catalyse sharing ellis arrived at dropbox about six months after he left logmein where he’d been able to spend big bucks to drive growth “but our freemium model at dropbox was a little different  we were giving away free space so there just wasn’t a lot of margin left for acquiring customers” he said “we realised we weren’t be able to spend money very effectively to grow the business but we had all these natural advantages to grow around collaboration and sharing loops that were in the product “what we did was catalyse sharing sharing was already happening with natural word of mouth and users sharing files with one another across the service we accelerated this growth engine by introducing  a doublesided referral programme  essentially a reward for both the referrer and the person who’s learning about the product – and we then did lots of optimisation on those loops that’s a really brief overview of ultimately how that business has grown to m users not using traditional marketing but it’s really understanding how that growth was already happening then building in the right incentives and optimising each of those growth drivers to maximise the potential” at that point brown took over adding “the thing with growth hacking and finding these exponential levers is that the benefits usually go to the first mover so now referral programmes are everywhere because everyone’s heard the dropbox story but the fact is that today a lot of referral programmes underperform and the ones that work really well work in the context of the product itself”  inside the process “rather than trying to take all these different growth hacking successes and apply them as to copies to your business it’s more effective to go through a process of identifying what the best levers in your business are for growth and then doubling down on them” brown said “and it kind of looks like this ideas prioritise test analyse optimise “so you do a lot of ideating – ideas are the currency of growth you have to have a big pipeline of ideas constantly “then of course time is our most precious asset in a startup there are millions of things to do so you have to be rigorous and prioritise them “everything should be tested – it’s relatively easy now with all the tools that are out there   “then go back and analyse and finally optimise those programs and user flows “then start the process again over and over” he said  growth hacking works for bb as well as bc businesses nontraditional growth levers aren’t just for consumerfocused companies continued brown “there are bb companies that do this really well too the trick with bb is that the growth has to be tied into the sales process fundamentally if you are running a saasenterprise business there’s a sales process attached to your growth efforts and sales has a lot of friction but there are companies which have figured out ways to take this friction out of the process linkedin yammer hubspot – have all done a really great job” brown went on to cite how inbound marketing and sales platform hubspot had worked out how to remove the friction from their acquisition process “they realised people didn’t want to fill out a lead form to get contacted by a salesperson but they were definitely interested in measuring how they’re doing” he explained “people have a couple of main motivators fear and greed and if you can play off one of those you’re setting yourself up to eliciting a response from your target customers ” marketing grader which as its name suggests enables users to grade and improve their marketing proves that playing off of people’s vanity can work he said “people want to see how they’re doing they like leaderboards and it’s great lead gen you ask for their url email address which goes into the sales process but as a user it also makes inherent sense because you are providing the information in order to get back a report that’s really valuable”  platform integrations as a growth lever   when people think of spectacular platform integrations they usually think about airbnbcraigslist said brown but in fact there are probably thousands of platforms a business can integrate with which all have large concentrations of people who will likely be in your target audience “trialpay did many integrations with different ecommerce platforms and it was a massive win” he said ellis added “i have one company that i angel invested in which is still relatively early stage but they have hundreds of thousand of dollars a month in mrr all through a salesforce integration  of their customer acquisition is through salesforce”   ‘powered by’ as a growth lever when youre looking for a growth opportunity sometimes the most obvious ones are right in front of your face said brown “on qualaroo we have ‘powered by qualaroo’ which is a link back to a landing page which generates a ton of traffic using a ‘powered by’ link is one way that companies can get inbound traffic from users who deploy a product to their websites i spent months trying to get paid acquisition to work for us it was very frustrating it didnt work and i never really touched this link “then growthhackerscom ran a case study about people who had done a lot of testing around their powered by link and massively increased their traffic as a result so we did some testing around our link and if you see qualaroo out in the wild today it says ‘not using qualaroo yet’  and that has led to a massive boom in the amount of traffic the number of trials and that type of thing”  growth is a team sport if you are relying on just marketing and sales to be your growth drivers youre only using a couple of cylinders of your overall growth engine said brown “growth comes from many different places and you need engineering and product to be on board whether you have a growth team that sits in the product organisation or you have a team that you put together that has people from different parts of the organisation but that works together on a regular basis you need them to catalyse that growth and look for new opportunities outside the traditional sales and marketing channels” he also urged companies to “evangelise the experimentation culture which celebrates failures and middling successes” share data and ensure people are invested in understanding what their company is doing “its important you get everyone on the same page because some of the best growth levers have nothing to do with marketing at all” he said read more growth case studies on growthhackerscom posted on  nov  tags growth marketing services working at index contact us disclaimer lp login medicxi ventures copyright
