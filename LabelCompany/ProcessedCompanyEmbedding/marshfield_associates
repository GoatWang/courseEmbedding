rights reserved philosophy  marshfield inc client log in register philosophy we believe that it is only through standing as far apart from the group as you can tolerate that you can hope to consistently outperform it our goal is to outperform the relevant market indices over time with lower risk of principal loss than is posed by those indices  our philosophy of calculated deviations from market norms seeks to take advantage of certain structural attributes of the market that negatively affect its results over time we seek to exploit market misjudgments in pricing by buying stocks that are cheaper than they should be because of a temporary aversion to them unlike the market which by definition is always fully invested we are willing to hold cash—sometimes lots of it we steer clear of generic “consensus” stocks in favor of those that are singular typically ones that have a strong but appropriate corporate culture thoughtful and disciplined capital management and—critically—are in a business in which they can grow intrinsic value over time our focus is on our companies’ ability to create value over the long term  while we assimilate shortterm results we exercise discipline in not reflexively reacting to them we are highly concentrated industry and sector agnostic and willing to double down on stocks we like when they get cheaper core strategy
