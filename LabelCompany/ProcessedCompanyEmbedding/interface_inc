sequencing them sometimes called signaling a standard interface such as scsi decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware such as io devices from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously or serial where data is sent one bit at a time software interfacesedit see also application binary interface and application programming interface a software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interface at different levels an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via streams and in object oriented programs objects within an application may need to interact via methods software interfaces in practiceedit a key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default allowing access only through welldefined entry points ie interfaces software interfaces provide access to computer resources such as memory cpu storage etc of the underlying computer system direct access ie not through well designed interfaces to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability interfaces between software components can provide constants data types types of procedures exception specifications and method signatures sometimes public variables are also defined as part of an interface the interface of a software module a is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module the latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface as well as other private variables procedures etc another software module b for example the client to a that interacts with a is forced to do so only through the published interface one practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of a by another implementation of the same interface should not cause b to fail—how a internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to b which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface see also liskov substitution principle software interfaces in objectoriented languagesedit main articles protocol objectoriented programming and concept generic programming in objectoriented languages the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code but defines behaviors as method signatures a class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface furthermore a class can implement multiple interfaces and hence can be of different types at the same time an interface is thus a type definition anywhere an object can be exchanged for example in a function or method call the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class this approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used for example a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available in another case a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called it must be implemented by nonabstract code to be run when it is invoked an interface called stack might define two methods push and pop it can be implemented in different ways for example faststack and genericstack—the first being fast working with a stack of fixed size and the second using a data structure that can be resized but at the cost of somewhat lower speed though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all for example the java language defines the interface readable that has the single read method various implementations are used for different purposes including bufferedreader filereader inputstreamreader pipedreader and stringreader marker interfaces like serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide runtime information to generic processing using reflection programming to the interfaceedit the use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface the idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used rather than on internal implementation details programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable pushing this idea to the extreme inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work user interfacesedit main article user interface a user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans it includes any number of modalities of interaction such as graphics

a software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interface at different levels an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via streams and in object oriented programs objects within an application may need to interact via methods software interfaces in practiceedit a key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default allowing access only through welldefined entry points ie interfaces software interfaces provide access to computer resources such as memory cpu storage etc of the underlying computer system direct access ie not through well designed interfaces to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability interfaces between software components can provide constants data types types of procedures exception specifications and method signatures sometimes public variables are also defined as part of an interface the interface of a software module a is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module the latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface as well as other private variables procedures etc another software module b for example the client to a that interacts with a is forced to do so only through the published interface one practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of a by another implementation of the same interface should not cause b to fail—how a internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to b which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface see also liskov substitution principle software interfaces in objectoriented languagesedit main articles protocol objectoriented programming and concept generic programming in objectoriented languages the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code but defines behaviors as method signatures a class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface furthermore a class can implement multiple interfaces and hence can be of different types at the same time an interface is thus a type definition anywhere an object can be exchanged for example in a function or method call the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class this approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used for example a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available in another case a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called it must be implemented by nonabstract code to be run when it is invoked an interface called stack might define two methods push and pop it can be implemented in different ways for example faststack and genericstack—the first being fast working with a stack of fixed size and the second using a data structure that can be resized but at the cost of somewhat lower speed though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all for example the java language defines the interface readable that has the single read method various implementations are used for different purposes including bufferedreader filereader inputstreamreader pipedreader and stringreader marker interfaces like serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide runtime

final artwork or control drawings are prepared for use in the next phase deliver by a vendor to create the finished design if everyone is satisfied with the final design we move to this final step completed control drawings are handed off to the appropriate vendor who will produce the finished items as first article samples arrive we check them for quality assurance and we deliver on deadline

interface of a software module a is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module the latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface as well as other private variables procedures etc another software module b for example the client to a that interacts with a is forced to do so only through the published interface one practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of a by another implementation of the same interface should not cause b to fail—how a internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to b which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface see also liskov substitution principle software interfaces in objectoriented languagesedit main articles protocol objectoriented programming and concept generic programming in objectoriented languages the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code but defines behaviors as method signatures a class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface furthermore a class can implement multiple interfaces and hence can be of different types at the same time an interface is thus a type definition anywhere an object can be exchanged for example in a function or method call the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class this approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used for example a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available in another case a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called it must be implemented by nonabstract code to be run when it is invoked an interface called stack might define two methods push and pop it can be implemented in different ways for example faststack and genericstack—the first being fast working with a stack of fixed size and the second using a data structure that can be resized but at the cost of somewhat lower speed though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all for example the java language defines the interface readable that has the single read method various implementations are used for different purposes including bufferedreader filereader inputstreamreader pipedreader and stringreader marker interfaces like serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide runtime information to generic processing using reflection programming to the interfaceedit the use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface the idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used rather than on internal implementation details programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable pushing this idea to the extreme inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work user interfacesedit main article user interface a user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans it includes any number of modalities of interaction such as graphics sound position movement etc where data is transferred between the user and the computer system see alsoedit abstraction inversion application binary interface application programming interface business interoperability interface computer bus

conversation with erich gamma part iii httpwwwartimacomindexjsp artima developer retrieved  once you depend on interfaces only youre decoupled from the implementation that means the implementation can vary and that is a healthy dependency relationship for example for testing purposes you can replace a heavy database implementation with a lighterweight mock implementation fortunately with todays refactoring support you no longer have to come up with an interface up front you can distill an interface from a concrete class once you have the full insights into a problem the intended interface is
