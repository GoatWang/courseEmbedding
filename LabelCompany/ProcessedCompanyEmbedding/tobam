diversification … posted on november   by yves rebetez in insight articles the well worn axiom in real estate is – location location location for parisbased tobam whose founder yves choueifaty we had the pleasure of sitting down with in toronto recently the corresponding mantra could well be diversification diversification diversification… and more diversification what does tobam seek to bring to the table in a world where “passive does not equal neutral” respectively one where  beyond passive “smart beta” or “factor” based strategies increasingly are crowding the product shelf answer the “undiversifiable” portfolio bottom line – it was probably high time we had a mathematician solve for “diversification” as with tobam this now appears to be “chose faite” the question could be – will investors grab onto the diversification factor one which come  could arguably become increasingly useful what we know in the smart beta field is that the enticement of yield and the premise of getting lower volatility have both had a very significant gravitational pull to them for investors as proper diversification is a key tenet of portfolio construction will it resonate with them and correspondingly attract significant assets and if diversification alone doesn’t do it for them will knowing that sri filters are also part of the recipe be what clenches the deal tobam commingled equity funds’investment universes are filtered based upon the norges bank investment management sri recommendations in canada mackenzie investments has launched  tobam based etfs  in june when it joined the ranks of canadian etfs providers  more since created to help protect a portfolio from equity market biases sector concentration and unmanaged risks by increasing diversification and reducing biases these equity etfs seek to enhance riskadjusted returns for investors the etfs are managed through a partnership with tobam a france based independent asset manager  the goal of the investment strategy at tobam is to achieve the optimal beta through diversification and to spread risk evenly throughout the portfolio mackenzie’s maximum diversification etf’s replicate and track proprietary indices provided by tobam’s maximum diversification index series tobam was among the founders of the “smartbeta” movement in   the firm has been awarded twice in  for its pioneering role in the foundation of the alternativesmart beta movement as well as more recently being recognized as “european asset manager of the year” by funds europe awards in london tobam uses an innovative methodology to select and weight individual stocks to significantly reduce correlations between holdings  the strategy is based on mr choueifaty’s development of a formal measure of diversification diversification ratio while we know that diversification is a good way to manage risk as it reduces volatility and enhances the riskadjusted returns the problem was that there has not been a universally agreed mathematical measure of diversification tobam’s research led to defining a mathematical measure the diversification ratio which provides tobam with a systematic approach for building well diversified portfolios the theory is that this approach will result in the most neutral possible portfolio taking no bets on style or valuation – focusing instead on “capturing the full equity market risk premium” mr choueifaty notes that he may be the only portfolio manager who does not make any predictions about the future or whether or not a stock is valued properly he may be the only active manager that is not looking to add ‘alpha’ tobam’s objective is to maximize diversification in order to capture the risk premium of an asset class in other words to provide the optimal ‘beta’  he notes that while many managers focus on capturing ‘alpha’ to contribute to performance less attention may be dedicated to improving ‘beta’ which often provides the major contribution to performance and to risk tobam believes the error with passive investing is that more money is constantly being allocated to overvalued stocks those with the largest weights in the market hence passive does not equal neutral active portfolio managers generally adhere to an investing strategystyle such as growth value or momentum to invest in one of these styles is to assume that the investment trends will continue to provide positive returns and that the manager will continue to select the best holdings to benefit from those trends which may or may not be correct getting these bets right can be very challenging particularly in the current environment  tobam’s strategy differentiates itself in that the managers are not making any assumptions or forecasts about future returns or which strategiesstyles will outperform and which ones will underperform  the key goal is to maximize and provide the optimal ‘beta’ thereby enhancing returns and reducing volatility over a market cycle   the antibenchmark® strategy is designed to create portfolios proposing to lie closer to the expost efficient frontier than the market cap portfolio over a market cycle antibenchmark® portfolios access the available risk premium in a risk efficient manner and are intending to typically enhance performance vs the benchmark by  pa via greater diversification for equity portfolios while also reducing volatility by  per annum over a market cycle for credit portfolios the strategy endeavours to outperform the benchmark by  per annum with less volatility as well source tobam the crux of the strategy is that holding a large number of assets does not necessarily mean the portfolio is optimally diversified rather it is that the portfolio must be exposed to a diversified number of sources of risk for optimal diversification while a portfolio with  holdings may at first appear well diversified if all  stocks are highly correlated to the price of oil that portfolio is not very well diversified tobam’s unique approach and formula seeks to maximize diversification of the portfolio by reducing the correlation of the various holdings table  shows the top holdings of mackenzie’s maximum

recently introduced multifactors category shows a category dominated by yield volatility and size in canada though size here is a misnomer in that including equal weight here overlooks the fact that equally weighting across us sectors such as healthcare and banking doesn’t exactly get one close to a pure “size” effect claiming the bulk of the assets and therefore growth generated in recent years etfs providing “factor” or “multifactor” solutions provide ready access to desired  desirable investment attributes which over time have proven to produce a risk premia for investors the challenge or issue factors can be in or out of favor and could spend lengthy periods in the “underperforming” category testing investors’ patience in the process in addition it isn’t inconceivable that factors with long track records of delivering a risk premia could on occasion become the object of “crowded trades” subsequently translating into – worse case scenario – subpar returns… caroline escott and

in the beginning was…research diversification dashboards and research articles maximum diversification® our investment philosophy tobam’s investment philosophy is based on maximizing diversification in order to capture the risk premium of an asset class while many managers focus upon ‘alpha’ to contribute to performance less attention may be dedicated to improving ‘beta’ which often provides the major contribution to performance and risk the most common way for investors to obtain ‘beta’ exposure is through a market capweighted strategy however academic and practitioner research shows that other strategies for gaining ‘beta’ exposure regularly outperform the market cap weighted strategies leading to inefficiencies in the allocation tobam believes that these inefficiencies arise from insufficient diversification in the market capweighted strategy decades of academic studies since harry markowitz  and william sharpe  have explained why diversification should play a key role in portfolios’s asset allocation yves choueifaty after years of academic research introduced a measure of diversification the diversification ratio® the details of this were initially published in  in the united states patent and trademark office choueifaty “methods and systems for providing an antibenchmark portfolio may  and later in  in the journal of portfolio management choueifaty  al “toward

assets in the portfolio allocation process the diversification ratio® is maximized to produce a portfolio designed to access risk premium evenly from all the effective independent sources of risk available in the market at any given time tobam’s approach is fully quantitative and does not use any predictions of expected return neither for the assets nor for any underlying risk factors maximum

whilst reducing volatility the antibenchmark® strategy is designed to create portfolios proposing to lie closer to the expost efficient frontier than the market cap portfolio over a market cycle antibenchmark® portfolios access the available risk premium in a risk efficient manner and intend to typically enhance performance vs the benchmark by  pa via greater diversification for equity portfolios while also reducing volatility by  per annum over a market cycle for credit portfolios the strategy endeavours to outperform the benchmark by  per annum with less volatility as well     view the full range of tobam’s antibenchmark® strategies   maximum diversification® in the beginning was…research the maximum diversification® approach and antibenchmark® model were developed and refined inhouse and are maintained by the research team  investment professionals are involved in research working on a day to day basis to increase the theoretical foundation for the antibenchmark® investment approach – making it one of the largest if not the largest research team dedicated to a single investment strategy in the asset management industry research is organized around three areas theoretical support implementation innovation and product research theoretical support discover explore and obtain a full understanding of potential new sources of risk premium although research may be technical and mathematical in nature we strive to produce results that make common financial and economic sense and can be intuitively explained to our investors and partners share our knowledge with a selected audience through our ties with leading academic institutions leading longterm investors as well as renowned academic journals   implementation innovation develop and refine applications for the antibenchmark® investment approach   product research  development pursue innovation and new product development tobam’s research effort is led by tristan froidure who has over  years of investment experience researching and developing quantitative investment and trading strategies the research department makes recommendations to the executive committee on potential improvements in the implementation of investment strategies the head of research works closely with yves choueifaty to set the company’s research agenda « toward maximum diversification » by yves choueifaty et al – journal of portfolio management fall  « properties of the most diversified portfolio » by yves choueifaty tristan froidure and julien reynier – the journal of investment strategies spring  “the bourbaki spirit” by tristan froidure head of research in the s a group of french mathematicians came together to reformulate modern mathematics from a perfectly rigorous selfcontained point of view the group used the pseudonym nicolas bourbaki here at tobam we believe in what we call ‘the bourbaki spirit’ we share bourbaki’s refusal of concepts that are not precisely defined we dedicate a significant amount of time focusing on definitions which we view as a prerequisite to conducting sound and original research work this means we avoid using conventional wisdom when it uses unclear definitions while our goal is not to produce an encyclopaedic and formidable body of work such as the “éléments de mathématique” this spirit has a distinctive influence on our approach our common research path involves going from clear definitions to establishing mathematical properties and then – and only then – conducting empirical tests to verify what could be expected from theoretical results having these high research standards we place a lot of efforts on research and have built a team of researchers and portfolio managers – who participate in or lead research initiatives – that are highly skilled experienced and diversified the three main research axes of our research team are theoretical research which includes portfolio construction essentially convex optimization statistics  econometrics implementation research in order to develop and refine the antibenchmark approaches generalization research apply research results to other environments we work with some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world and we consider that applying our expertise and research capabilities to their complex challenges is a crucial step in building a solid and grounded research team on top of our three main research axis we hence spend a significant amount of our research efforts finding customized answers to challenging issues raised by our clients in an effort to ensure no stone is unturned a diversified and effective research team the team is encouraged to be as “out of the box” in its approach to ‘conventional wisdoms’ as possible as such the diversity of the team is a critical part of how well it functions we have a large range of expertise from highly skilled mathematicians engineers economists traders all of which feeds in to the team’s ability to look at problems or assumptions from a very broad spectrum of viewpoints furthermore research is conducted without a formal hierarchy when it comes to their work researchers are encouraged to exchange and develop ideas free from the constraints of a pecking order which affords the team considerable freedom in their research approach and takes full advantage of the diversity of the team the team has a strong academic contingent but our main goal is to focus on our own research projects and to focus less on academic literature to feed into our research process in fact publishing our results in the form of academic level papers internally is one of our main research goals indeed the process of summarising our findings provides additional coherence to our work and helps us focus on delivering research of the highest standard we first share our findings with our clients which contributes to set the foundations of a knowledge sharing spirit we have also published articles in journals to benefit from open debate from time to time in the end our ultimate agenda is to serve our clients and being fully dedicated to their needs and projects research transparency an intelligent investment tobam’s flagship portfolio construction method most diversified portfolio or mdp has been published for all to see in fact we like to think of ourselves as a ‘crystal box’ disclosing and openly discussing what we do with our clients in today’s financial world which has been rocked by a series of scandals clever transparency is a winning bet i think we would have fewer assets under management if we operated as a ‘black box’ being transparent has also helped us systematically focus on and improve the weakest parts of our approach – a chain is only as strong as its weakest link finally we have always viewed transparency as a necessary condition for being taken seriously by large institutional investors we believe that the real world incarnation of the mdp under the brand “antibenchmark” has the potential to replace traditional market capitalization weighted benchmarks as a core portfolio this is thanks to its intrinsic qualities and to the many resources tobam dedicates to transparent research simple ideas are beautiful i personally believe that the “best” ideas are simple in khalil gibran’s sense “the obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply” take for example the notion of portfolio diversification which tobam first introduced in  its formulation is very simple and is becoming obvious today to asset management practitioners academics and students ten years after its first publication the research we are conducting today is still leading us to very exciting new results that are directly connected to it
