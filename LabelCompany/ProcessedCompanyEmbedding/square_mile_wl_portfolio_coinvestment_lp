consolation real estate managers’ coinvestments no comfort to investors by arleen jacobius · january   real estate managers have been sampling their own cooking for decades but that didnt make losses among the largest coinvestments any more palatable to outside investors after the economic meltdown of  indeed investment strategies of some large real estate managers that had made sizable investments alongside their investors suffered some of the worst returns industry insiders say this is prompting consultants and investors to reconsider whether real estate coinvestment truly ensures the fortunes of managers and their investors rise and fall together related coverage real estate cpa giant leventhal dies at age  jp morgan betting real estate investors take to small makeover some real estate managers fared well — because of the fees they collected — even as the investment portfolios performed poorly and some of the portfolio managers who did not have any personal investment in the funds are leaving firms in pursuit of new opportunities industry insiders say although no one would name names the result is that coinvestment funds are being structured very differently large institutional investors are revisiting the issue of alignment of interests and changing the way they invest in real estate the  billion california state teachers retirement system west sacramento looked at the issue of alignment of interests as part of a review of its real estate investment policy “the overall decision was a move to more core investments to deleverage the portfolio and in terms of alignment of interest to choose partners that have large ownership interests in the investments pitched and structure agreements with alignment in mind” ricardo duran spokesman said in an emailed response to questions he said calstrs executives have not seen a relationship between coinvestment and investment manager performance to “any significant degree” “calstrs is looking for partnerships that provide for liquidity through redemption and termination provisions that benefit investors and provide management accountability through greater disclosure” he said when asked whether coinvestments can align general partner and limited partner interests mr duran stated “yes they can be provided the documents are negotiated properly with that in mind” meaningful coinvestment mark a grinis global real estate investment funds leader at ernst  young llc new york agreed “the principle is that the coinvestment has got to mean something to the general partner” if a small fourperson investment group makes a  coinvestment in a  million fund that is going to mean a lot more than if a big investment bank invests a similar percentage in its real estate investment subsidiarys fund he explained “i think the lesson learned is investors are looking for the key principals to have material skin in the game” mr grinis said across the real estate investment business many real estate managers are making preemptive changes to funds to make the coinvestments more attractive many new funds are pooling returns so managers no longer are able to extract their returns on a dealbydeal basis instead profits are pooled and everyone — managers and investors — waits until the fund is liquidated before they can share in the profits and fees mr grinis explained whats more management fees in the new funds are substantially lower and are based on the committed capital so investment managers can no longer make money in fees whether the properties make money or not large coinvestments provide little guarantee of returns morgan stanley ms real estate funds include a  capital commitment which was called for funds v and vi sources told pensions  investmentsthrough march   morgan stanley real estate fund v international lp has returned  since inception in october  and morgan stanley real estate vi international lp returned  since its july  inception according to calstrs latest semiannual real estate report “what helps us sleep at night is the notion that whatever happens to us will happen to the manager” said marc weidner new yorkbased managing director of real estate fundoffunds manager franklin templeton ben real estate advisors “but its a mirage” some of the real estate managers structured their fee arrangements so any losses from their coinvestments were relatively modest when compared to the asset management and other fees those managers received he said wall street investment firms with real estate management subsidiaries created the strategy of coinvesting to coax wary investors into real estate portfolios the firms had bought through the resolution trust corp a federal program begun in  to liquidate assets held by insolvent savings and loans the idea of shared risk with managers gave investors comfort and worked to draw them into these investments explained ted leary president of consultant crosswater realty advisors los angeles now coinvestment is de rigueur in the industry “it makes everybody feel better if the general partner loses money alongside the limited partner” mr leary said in an interview in a letter this month to clients and colleagues mr leary wrote “i continue to see no demonstrable evidence that manager coinvestment makes a manager a better investor in fact some of the most dramatic loss situations i dealt with involved very significant coinvestment by the manager on the other hand several of the most successful programs i observed had minimal manager coinvestment” some managers have defaulted on their coinvestment consultants say although none would name names “some managers overstretched because they bought the dream that they were selling” franklin templetons mr weidner said he would not identify any firms still not all of the big managers that made large coinvestments suffered lousy returns many held their own even during the latest financial crisis warburg pincus llc madison capital partners and square mile capital llc all managed to return investors capital plus some profits insiders said alignment of interests is serious business to investors last august calstrs bought out its partners  interest in four joint ventures it entered into in  with first industrial realty trust a real estate investment trust “the move was done to achieve full control of the properties because calstrs felt there was not a full alignment of interest between partners” mr duran told pi at the timemost institutional investors are reviewing their real estate investment strategies and how they invest in the asset class but few are jettisoning their coinvestment requirements “i must admit i have not won this argument with my clients and certainly not with the consultant community” crosswaters mr leary saidmaking changes ernst  youngs mr grinis said real estate investment managers already are making changes even existing funds are getting restructured to make sure interests are more aligned with investors interests in essence managers of these newly realigned funds are getting paid at the end rather than reaping fees during the life of the fund whether the fund makes money or not mr grinis declined to name any examples paul greenwood managing director of northern lights capital group llc a private equity firm that invests in asset management firms said “alignment of interest  is crucial to the longterm success and the success in providing clients with a consistently good product” but achieving it varies with each investment he said “if im a startup investment manager with no personal wealth beyond what ive invested in my firm i might have a good case for a tight alignment with my investors” mr greenwood said “if im worth  million and ive invested  million in the fund i may have alignment with my investors maybe or maybe not” glenn shannon president of san franciscobased shorenstein realty services lp agrees that coinvestment is not a quick fix that automatically aligns manager and investor interests shorenstein has committed  million of the  billion raised in its nine funds since  but alignment of interests is more than making a coinvestment he said “investors should also focus on whether the structure of the investment vehicle in terms of duration and fees promotes the investment expertise of the sponsor and the personnel and financial resources of the sponsor are all aligned with the investment strategy of the fund” mr shannon said real estate investingportfolio strategies news top picks uncertain times for private equity investors rick funston
