have been lower past performance can vary over short periods past performance is no guarantee of future results since it purchases equity securities including common stocks the fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time  these factors contribute to price volatility which is the principal risk of investing in the fund    the fund may focus its investments from time to time on one or more economic sectors  to the extent that it does so developments affecting companies in that sector or sectors will likely have a magnified effect on the fund’s net asset value and total return   the fund is subject to the risks associated with selling securities short a short sale involves a finite opportunity for appreciation but a theoretically unlimited risk of loss   the smaller capitalization companies the fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies therefore small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies   the fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments  foreign investments may be riskier than us investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions changes in currency exchange rates incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities and political or economic instability  foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than us stocks the risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment   the fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options including  the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates  there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of options and the securities underlying them  there may not be a liquid secondary market for options and  while the fund will receive a premium when it writes call options it may not participate fully in a rise in
