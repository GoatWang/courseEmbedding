reproduction without prior authorizations strategy  doliver advisors   strategy quantitative investing doliver implements a quantitative investing strategy which uses statistical models programming active trading and short holding periods  our trading process uses real time and historical data model inputs to project discount changes and then screens these by importance of our weighting parameters  a few of doliver’s model components are annual return annual risk capital capacity turnover and sharpe ratio  these components are used to determine the attractiveness of a fund for our client’s portfolios  we then rank the funds and execute trades through a proprietary trading platform   about cefs  doliver advisors   closedend funds our niche in the market doliver has been managing money for clients since  over  years it focuses exclusively on investing in closedend funds cefs a closedend fund is a professionally managed portfolio of individual securities which has a specific value called the “net asset value” nav the nav is derived from the sum of the total value of securities held in the portfolio divided by the total number of outstanding shares a fund’s nav is a specific price per share and is calculated daily based on the closing market price   different from a mutual fund a closedend fund shares are not redeemable from the fund itself based on the daily nav instead the shares of a closedend fund trade on the major exchanges where the forces of supply and demand cause share prices to fluctuate since shares are bought and sold in the open market at any given time the share price of a closedend fund may be greater premium position or less discount position than the nav thus creating potential pricing inefficiencies as a simplified illustration a closedend fund investor may buy  worth of stock  nav for  cents or one may sell  worth of stock  nav for  of course the converse may also be true although more than  different closedfunds exist today with over  billion dollars in total capitalization they represent a relatively small part of the overall market   foundation  doliver advisors   foundation longterm growth capitalizing on cef pricing inefficiencies core strategies doliver’s longterm wealthbuilding strategy is derived from our strategic investing approach and quantitative models since inception doliver has capitalized on pricing inefficiencies identified in the cef niche learn about cefs our founders background after graduating from rice university ron olin joined ibm directing programmer staffs for groundbased computer systems for the apollo space program at nasa after  years ron applied his extensive knowledge of computerbased analytics to investment markets where he derived the core belief that the financial markets are overall very efficient he then began work to develop a program and became an activist in closedend funds cef’s the investment principles employed by doliver capital advisors were then established our strategy utilizes a proprietary quantitative model and database to identify and evaluate probabilities related to price and nav changes in order to select a portfolio of attractively valued closedend funds doliver has focused its effort and research in this specific market niche since inception in  more about ron interested in learning more about ron olins background and

advisors   priorities our beliefs   we believe safety and preservation of capital are a priority   we believe the compensation to doliver should be directly related to performance and based on the success of the client’s account   we believe that the stock market in general is very efficient and that no one can consistently predict or time the market we believe that with proper analysis and sufficient effort inefficiencies or inappropriately priced closedend funds can be identified and exploited   we believe discipline in buying at the right price leads to better returns performance
