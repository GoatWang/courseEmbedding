ying li texas a  m university  college station link find in your library abstract using survey data collected in multiple locations california and texas in the united states and revohot in israel we quantify category and locationspecific variations of consumers’ willingness to pay wtp for brand products after controlling for consumer characteristics we find that consumers have a similar qualitative assessment of brand value in different product categories across different locations that is consumers have a stronger preference and higher wtp for brands in consumer electronics followed by clothing and then processed food and the lowest in fresh produce furthermore we simulate price premiums and market shares of brands relative to generic products in different categories simulation results suggest that brands in fresh produce have the highest price premium but lowest market share despite the similarities the magnitude of wtp for brands as well as the simulated price premium and the corresponding market share in the same product category are location variant the similarities and dissimilarities suggest validity of having global brand strategies adapted to local conditions that is the socalled “thinking globally and acting locally” strategy keywords brands willingness to pay regional differences price premium maximum entropy disciplines agricultural and resource
