managers and the bankers lawyers accountants  other advisors who support them faculty  schedule  registration  location  sponsorship  audio package  a seismic shift is taking place in the health wellness and personal care markets as consumers employers and even governments search for alternatives to traditional healthcare treatments   much of this has been fueled by aging baby boomers who are the nation’s most affluent demographic  out of these  million americans controlling nearly  of us financial assets thousands are turning age  every day  and they don’t want to feel like it   what’s more as gen xers and millennials watch their parents age they also seek solutions factor in the  of americans who are overweight or obese and it should be no surprise the average household spends nearly  per month on wellness products and services             this is a growth market you can’t ignore and you’ll be on the fast track           by attending the capital roundtable’s brand‑new conference on           “private equity investing in health wellness  personal care           companies” being held in new york city on thursday may            sponsored by the parthenon group llc              plus you’ll feel exceptionally good when you sign up for this            conference before march   that’s because you’ll qualify for our early            bird rate and enjoy a savings of    to chair this timely conference we’re delighted to welcome jon canarick managing director at north castle partners in greenwich connecticut  the leading small cap consumer private equity firm focused on health wellness and active living companies   the companies that north castle and this conference are targeting represent  of the overall  trillion consumer market  a  trillion sector all by themselves  they represent some of today’s most indemand consumer categories    recreation and active living  a  billion market that emphasizes fitness and activities nutrition  a  billion market including weight management sports nutrition organic and natural foods vitamins specialty and gourmet foods and “lesser evil” betterforyou snacks consumer health  a  billion market including home health care home nursing rehabilitation services and alternative medicine beauty and personal care sports and fitness education pet care and other areas  a combined market total of  billion and while this marketplace is rich with opportunities it’s also highly fragmented making it ideally suited for middlemarket private equity firms who wish to gain a foothold  or expand their presence     there are excellent possibilities for building market leaders and creating value through leveraged buyouts growth capital infusions and strategic acquisitions   just some recent middlemarket activity includes bridgepoint capital’s acquisition of online cycling and trisports retailer wiggle  medallion capital’s acquisition of nutrient manufacturer paca foods  and wind point partners’ acquisition of pet products manufacturer petmate   although consumers are certainly not immune from health and wellness fads  oxygen bars “toning” sneakers and “cleanse” diets come to mind  it’s the overall trend that counts which keeps on growing  modern science is driving our desires for better nutrition physical activity and stress management  and bringing us tastier options for healthy eating  while category products often carry premium prices consumers pushback less when they perceive benefits to their health   the trend is also enhanced because consumers have more access to information than ever technology has given consumer advocates rising voices and consumers are proud to share the healthy living brands they associate with in their social networks  further driving category growth     this has helped many small brands that started in the health food or professional channels to quickly gain prominence in supermarkets and big box stores   the regulatory environment is similar to other segments of the consumer market with advertising claims of particular importance  newer regulation may bring positive benefits to the category  requirements to post calorie counts on menus can hurt restaurants but encourage healthy choices  or “sin taxes” on tobacco products and sugary drinks can encourage greater spending on active living products  health wellness  personal care specialists have a prescription for profits   our conference chair jon canarick brings  years of consumer private equity investment experience to the dais  since joining north castle partners in  jon has driven the execution of and actively managed north castles investments across a variety of healthy living sectors  jon currently sits on the boards of gloprofessional mineral fusion flatout international fitness and performance bicycle     prior to joining north castle jon worked in the financial sponsors coverage and leveraged finance groups of bear stearns  co where he executed leveraged buyout transactions and provided advisory services for financial sponsors  jon received a bba from the university of michigan and an mba from columbia business school   along with jon we’ll have a team of  knowledgeable panelists who live with the health wellness and personal care market daily  you’ll hear from gps portfolio company operating executives investment bankers lenders consultants and more  ready to boost your knowledge of the industry   you’ll hear why the health wellness and personal care channel touches more consumers than many people think  no longer a new york california or oregon phenomenon it’s seeing worldwide demand  across north america in europe and especially japan where the population is aging faster than any other country   and you’ll learn which key issues affect consumer attitudes toward health wellness and personal care  for example sustainability is now a key criterion in purchase decisions  and proactive management of health care concerns is an important factor  consumers are choosing products that may address such chronic conditions as diabetes and obesity   register now to get the answers to important questions like these    what are the key challenges facing health wellness and personal care companies for  how does the present economic environment affect companies in the sector what are some of the likely growth areas within health wellness and personal care as consumers increasingly have access to prevention and care information how are health wellness and personal care companies benefiting from this understanding how

sponsorship  audio package  more and more manufacturers and retailers are publishing ingredient lists labeling nutritional contents avoiding gmos disclosing portion sizes advertising “organic” and “fresh” and “natural” and “local”  and successfully using that information to market to consumers   this is a longterm sustainable trend  and the proof is in the deteriorating revenues of makers of sugary soft drinks and highfat snack items   offenders face a double whammy  consumers are no longer buying as much and retailers are reducing shelf space in favor of betterforyou products   private label is another area where food makers are finding great promise   many retailers  apart from traditional grocery stores  are entering the goodforyou marketplace and all are seeking their own private labels to act as brand differentiators and not surprisingly these merchants are generating higher profits because they hire contract packagers to produce products similar to branded cereals think corn flakes or commodity products like nuts think chocolate almonds that command higher margins   the reasons are clear why investors are pursuing food and nutrition deals  multiples in the us average  for food deals versus  for all middlemarket deals pe firms invested over  billion in food deals last year compared to just  billion in  diet preferences for natural ingredients whole grains and high fiber have spread from major metropolitan areas to the entire country the question is how do investors separate fads from real opportunities  not every maker or marketer of niche food products no matter how effective has the staying power to become a successful concern there’s still need for heavy due diligence especially in the nutraceutical space where regulation is a constant concern   if you’re hungry for success in this rewarding marketplace you need to register now for the capital roundtable’s encore conference  “private equity investing in food  nutrition companies”  being held in new york city on thursday april    at this year’s conference we will zero in on the impact to food and nutrition investing from consumers’ new ways of shopping millennials are loading up on nutritional items via nextday delivery websites such as amazon working couples are ordering their fresh and frozen items through home delivery services like peapod or fresh direct and busy professionals are grabbing soups and sandwiches and even fresh bananas from food trucks and stores like walgreens walmart and target   america’s changing demographics are also giving a boost to ethnic foods millennials are overwhelmingly more likely to cook ethnic meals than their parents and have taste palates conditioned to appreciate world flavors spices and textures   so chia seeds and ancient grains have migrated overseas to american shelves and found rapid acceptance   then there’s the nonmeat protein trend  producers of soybased and other protein alternatives are beneficiaries of this trend aided by the many americans who don’t wish to become total vegetariansvegans but do want to reduce their meat consumption  often called “flexitarians”   similarly the push to find alternatives to wheat rye and barley has powered up the glutenfree category where many investors are making big bets   as a natural corollary investing in food ingredient companies is just as promising  for example the growth of protein bars has produced rewards not just for their manufacturers but also for the companies supplying whey protein … plant fiber … and similar showcase ingredients   here are  important reasons you should register now for this encore capital roundtable conference “private equity investing in food  nutrition companies” understand how to identify product categories where nimble private equitybacked companies can better meet consumer needs than slowmoving processed foods giants hear details why betterforyou products are such an important place for investors to be during  learn the likelihood of new government regulations on natural and organic labeling portion sizing and more discover which events are shaking up the marketplace such as whole foods’ recent pledge to put gmo products on notice recognize how and why private label market share is rising as the perceived value differential shrinks know why foreign investors are joining the pool of usbased pe firms and strategic buyers potential exits include not only usbased pe firms and strategic buyers but also foreign investors who want a footprint here the capital roundtable welcomes and thanks our marquis
