is outlined it is uncertain if further exploration drilling will result in the determination of a mineral resource in this volume about orocobre limited orocobre limited is listed on the australian securities exchange and toronto stock exchange asxore tsxorl and is building a substantial argentinianbased industrial chemicals and minerals company through the construction and operation of its portfolio of lithium potash and boron projects and facilities in the puna region of northern argentina the company has built in partnership with toyota tsusho corporation and jemse the first largescale greenfield brine based lithium project in approximately  years at the salar de olaroz with planned production of  tonnes per annum of lowcost lithium carbonate the olaroz lithium facility has a low environmental footprint because of the following aspects of the process the process is designed to have a high processing recovery of lithium with its low unit costs the process will result in low cutoff grades which will maximise resource recovery the process route is designed with a zero liquid discharge design all waste products are stored in permanent impoundments the lined evaporation ponds at the end of the project life the ponds will be capped and returned to a similar profile following soil placement and planting of original vegetation types brine is extracted from wells with minimum impact on freshwater resources outside the salar because the lithium is in sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability drawdowns are limited to the salar itself this is different from halite hosted deposits such as salar de atacama salar de hombre muerto and salar de rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface permeability and the drawdown cones can impact on water resources around the salar affecting the local environment energy used to concentrate the lithium in the brine is solar energy the carbon footprint is lower than other processes the technology developed has a very low maximum fresh water consumption of  ls which is low by industry standards this fresh water is produced by reverse osmosis from nonpotable brackish water sales de

albemarle’s silver peak mine several of the lithium brine production wells at silver peak are situated within  meters west of the clayton ne project’s claim boundary historical data on the property includes drillhole cv which was part of a regional drill program conducted by the united states geological survey usgs in  the hole was drilled to a depth of  feet and encountered lithium values in ground water ranging from  ppm to  ppm averaging  ppm for a group of  samples and averaging  ppm for another group of  samples advantage lithium believes additional aquifers potentially hosting brines of similar or better contents of lithium could be intersected by deeper drilling in q  the company plans to commence a hole drill program at clayton ne targeting the silver peak border jackson wash  the jackson wash lithium project covers  acres in nevada’s lida valley basin located  kilometers southeast of the silver peak mine of clayton valley the underexplored lida valley is analogous in sedimentary formations and underlying structures to clayton valley in  historical exploration conducted on the property included sampling and geological surveying sampling at six locations returned lithium values ranging from  ppm lithium to  ppm lithium a detailed gravity survey and two csamt lines surveyed by a previous operator were interpreted as a layered sequence of unconsolidated saturated alluvial sediments filling a deep basin beneath the valley floor advantage lithium believes the property has the potential to host a reservoir of lithium brine within an outlined gravity low the company has planned a three to fourhole drill program to test specific structural and stratigraphic targets believed prospective for lithium brine deposits in february  the bureau of land management blm granted a drill permit for up to  holes over two years gemini  the gemini lithium project covers  acres in the lida valley basin and is located  kilometers southeast of the clayton valley basin between  to  a university of texas geological research team conducted gravity surveys in the lida valley the resulted indicate strong gravity lows within two faulted subbasins gemini west and gemini east approximately  kilometers apart and hundreds of meters deep in early  results from two movingloop tdem surveys carried out on the gemini property by nevada sunrise detected a conductive layer  meters to  meters deep which appears to cover most of gemini west and gemini east subbasins several isolated strong conductive zones were interpreted at depths from  meters to  meters indicating the potential for lithiumrich brine within the subbasins the blm has granted permits for  exploration drill holes at gemini to test the subbasins for lithiumbearing brines neptune  the neptune lithium project covers  acres in the southwest clayton valley basin and is located about  kilometers to the north of silver peaks in an active area for lithium mining and exploration historical geophysical data indicates the property has the potential to host lithium brines in subterranean aquifers the blm has permitted  drill holes at neptune nevada sunrise has completed two drill holes on the property to date in the first hole sampling from the intersected strata contained lithiumbearing sediments that averaged  ppm lithium over  meters from  meters to the end of hole at  meters reaching a peak value of  ppm lithium in addition biogeochemical data collected near the drill holes confirmed anomalous lithium concentrations ranging from  ppm up to  ppm advantage lithium is planning a third drill hole up to  meters deep and approximately  kilometers east of the first hole a  geophysical survey interpreted this area to be a potential trap where denser lithiumbearing brines could migrate and pool aquarius the aquarius lithium project covers  acres in the central clayton valley basin approximately  kilometers southwest of the silver peak mine in march  nevada
