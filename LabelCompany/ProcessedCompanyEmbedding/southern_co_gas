gas coal and nuclear generation sources to generate approximately  terawatthours of electricity in  coal represented  percent of the companys output followed by nuclear  and natural gas  renewable hydroelectric power represented  percent of southerns generation coalbased generation dropped significantly in  from an average of  between  and  in june  the united states department of energy awarded an  billion loan guarantee to facilitate the construction of two new nuclear reactors at plant vogtle near augusta georgia a southern company subsidiary georgia power owns  of the current  mw facility with coowners oglethorpe power  municipal electric authority of georgia  and the city of dalton  the plant is operated by georgia power the  billion construction project is scheduled to be completed by  and would double the plants capacity the construction of two  mw reactors has been hailed by energy secretary steven chu as the first new nuclear power plant to break ground in decades it is expected to create up to  jobs during the construction phase and  once operational however in march  westinghouse electric company who are building the plant filed for chapter  bankruptcy because of  billion of losses from its two us nuclear construction projects the us government had given  billion of loan guarantees on the financing of the four nuclear reactors being built in the us and it is expected a way forward to completing the plant can be agreed plant ratcliffeedit in september  the epa introduced new provisions regarding output of carbon emissions in new power facilities the proposed emission limit for new energy sources will be lbs of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity preemptively recognizing the need for these changes southern company broke ground on its stcentury clean coal facility in june  southern’s subsidiary mississippi power will operate the plant the kemper county energy facility or kemper project takes advantage of the abundant lignite or poor quality coal available in mississippi additionally it employs transport gasifier trig technology trig technology is built on the idea of dryfeed nonslag gasifiers which operate at lower temperatures than other coal gasifiers this dryfeed is crushed heated and circulated in the gasifier producing a flammable synthetic gas syngas syngas can generate electricity with fewer emissions of course other byproducts are produced like ammonia and sulphuric acid these particular products are sold for commercial use the epa considers the kemper coal project and other planned facilities like it to be a lifeline for the coal industry in the wake of the new climate change plan between  and  approximately  coal plants were shut down as of april  the us department of energy had invested m in

department of energy on a variety of projects including transmission and distribution of infrastructure and smart grid initiatives environmental research programs and nuclear generation one of the more significant joint efforts the doe’s national carbon capture center is managed by southern company and represents national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coalbased power generation at this location southern company has been working with scientists and technology developers from government industry and universities who are creating the next generation of carbon capture technologies along with the doe southern company has been working with kbr another technology partner to perfect its trig advanced coal gasification technology this process of breaking down “dirty coal” or lignite into its chemical components is not only cleaner but it’s also less expensive and more reliable this technology is currently being implemented at southern company’s kemper county power plant one of the few new coal facilities working to keep the us coal industry alive this new facility will be built on a lignite seam is expected to strip out twothirds of carbon dioxide emissions leaving emissions at about the same level as natural gas the kemper coal plant is expected to fall well under new regulations implemented by the epa which limits coal plants to lbs of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity in an effort to make this technology more attainable southern company has partnered with china’s shenhua group to collaborate on further research development and deployment of clean coal technologies in the us china and around the world this partnership with shenhua who is currently expected to add more than  megawatts of coalfired capacity by  could lead to wide deployment of trigequipped power plants across asia trig technology has the potential to not only assist china with their growing carbon issue but also enable the country to tap into their own low quality coal kemper project controversiesedit in february  the mississippi supreme court ruled southern companys subsidiary mississippi power must refund  south mississippi
