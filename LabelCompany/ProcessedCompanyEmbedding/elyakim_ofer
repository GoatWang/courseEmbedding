fourth quarter of  including by segment and full year  preliminary composition of revenues for  anticipated gross margin improvement gradual recovery of the cordless business and the anticipated general annual or secular decline of such business our ability to secure additional design wins mass production time tables and general market demand for products that incorporate our technologies in the market we assume no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements for more information about the risks and factors that could affect the forwardlooking statements made herein please refer to the risk factors discussed in our  form k and other sec reports we have filed now i would like to turn the call over to ofer elyakim our chief executive officer ofer the floor is yours ofer elyakim thank you daniel good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i hope that you have the opportunity to read our press release that we distributed earlier today i would like to begin by reviewing our results for the third quarter commenting on the progression of our business plan and providing context for our outlook in a short while dror will provide you with detailed comments on our financial results and outlook for the fourth quarter of  we achieved third quarter financial results that were well ahead of our guidance in almost every financial metric our performance reflect record revenue contributions from new product propelling an overall  yearoveryear revenue growth record new product revenues of  million which grew by  yearoveryear demonstrate the transition of our business model towards new product initiative including mobile voice and the iot product segment these new products accounted for  of third quarter revenues and supported the  basis point annual expansion in both gaap and nongaap gross margins of  and  respectively the improved third quarter operating profitability also reflected a continued focus on achieving operating leverage our gaap and nongaap operating margins increased by  and  basis points respectively when compared to the third quarter of  to  of revenues and  of revenues respectively driving our gaap and nongaap earnings per share to  and  respectively third quarter revenues of approximately  million grew by  yearoveryear and by  sequentially revenue growth by better than expected revenues in our voice and mobile segments as well as by gradual sequential improvement in our cordless phone business looking forward we expect to successfully accomplish our  new product goals for revenue growth of approximately  evidencing our successful expansion in to the new market verticals and diversifying our revenue base while we project yearoveryear revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter we expect that our fourth quarter revenue results will be negatively impacted by some weakness in our mobile segment in the third quarter we made solid progress across all of our new product initiatives and continued to gain traction with both existing and newer tier one oems and leading service provides we remain optimistic regarding our business outlook for both the short and long term periods as our new product across office mobile home and iop more widely adopted in driving increased interest in a solid design pipeline we anticipate that these categories will comprise the majority of our revenues in the year  now i’d like to provide you with specific updates about the progress in each segment starting with mobile during the quarter we generated better than expected revenues of approximately  million from sales of hdclear products which represented the small sequential increase over the second quarter driven by better than expected demand from our tier one customers we’re happy to inform you that in addition to the design win we announced last quarter we have secured another design win for a known smartphone application with a leading north american oem that is expected to launch in the mid of  we are excited about the market dynamics and especially the green field opportunity for voice activation and control there is a growing demand for incorporating voice user interface in to a wide range of products and voice activation is becoming a preferred way for interacting with an activating devices as an example we believe that the digital assistant market alone would increase ten folds in the next three years and with the recent design wins we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend our dbmp and hdclear product offer the lowest power consumption and bestinclass performance for enhancing voice user interface and including noise suppression barging or inaudible with listening voice trigger and voice command looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect to meet our annual mobile revenue target of  million although we anticipate a sequential decline in mobile revenues for the fourth quarter due to the unanticipated termination of our flagship product by a leading mobile oem we therefore forecast fourth quarter mobile revenues to be in the range of  million to  million moving to the voice over ip and office segment we continue to solidify our leadership in the enterprise standalone market as demonstrated by strong and growing design pipeline with tier one oem and other leading customers for the third quarter we achieved record quarterly revenues of  million representing an increase of  yearoveryear and  sequentially this result was well ahead of our previous guidance of  million to  million contributing to the better results was stronger than expected ramp of one of our tier one oems and stronger overall market demand during the quarter we secured an additional design win with a leading tier one oem for highend conferencing system supporting both voice and video communication moreover several customers launched new products based on our voip socs as an example grandstream launched its new dp and dp dect ip phones in a complete new lineup of ata products based on our voiceoverip soc moreover panasonic launched its new kxhdp  and  series including highend color and video ip phones based on our dvf soc for the fourth quarter we expect both voip revenues to be in the range of  million to  million suggesting a sequential decline mainly as a result of the faster than expected ramp that we experienced from our new tierone oem customer in the second and third quarters we initially expected this ramp up to take place mostly during the third and fourth quarters we are optimistic about the outlook for our voip business and the strength of our design pipeline and our offering which cover both high to lowend solutions and believe that this segment is well positioned for solid revenue growth now to an update on the home segment which includes home gateways iot spark pa and cordless i will start with home gateways third quarter revenues of  million increased by  yearoveryear and by  sequentially and were ahead of our expectations the additional demand was largely due to an initial ramp of a leading australian service provider that launched dect enabled home gateways and bundled catiq handsets both based on our dect and catiq socs moreover adb a leading european provider and system and software for connected home solutions integrated our dectcatiq soc for its latest lines of home gateways we expect fourth quarter home gateway revenues to be slightly down on a sequential basis but to further accelerate in  coinciding new product launches by a number of telecom operators the underlying market trend behind is the integration of dect in to home gateways and the growing adoption of hd voice such as upgrading their infrastructure and a customer premises equipment to support hd voice which provides us with ample growth opportunities moreover we are seeing a growing number of telecom service providers that are already leveraging their dect enabled home gateway infrastructure as a hope to over subscribers outofthebox iot services which are easy to install and plug and play and at a much lower cost of ownership now turning to iot during the third quarter we generated  million in revenues from our iot representing growth of  yearoveryear and a decline of  on a sequential basis during the quarter we continued expand our iot ecosystem and announced a number of new design win a first with eurotronic a leading german manufacturer of wireless smart home solutions and we selected ule soc for its new smart home product that includes thermostat wall switch door and window contacts all of which are targeted for tier one european service provider second sercomm a leading manufacturer of telecom and broadband equipment announced a full series of smart home sensors that are based on dsp groups dect ule and targeted for a leading tier one service provider in addition roc connect a leading smart homer services platform announced that it will offer its channel partners ule support across its smart home hub we expect a strong momentum in our iot business to continue and demand from customers to accelerate in the fourth quarter propelled by preparations for smart home service launch by two leading service providers we are therefore optimistic that we will surpass our previous  annual revenue expectation of  million to  million in the iot segment ule is gaining traction as an iot connectivity technology due to its strong technical merits that include better coverage and longer range interference free and dedicated and natural support for twoway data voice and video moreover we are seeing growing interest from customers for adding voice user interface to smart home systems viewed as the preferred user interface for the home environment this represents another meaningful growth opportunity for ule technology which is designed to support high quality twoway voice and audio and bestinclass range and propagation now to an update on the spark pa in the beginning of the year we unveiled a new and highly innovative product category that leverages our decades of cmos rf design expertise spark pa is a  gigahertz wifi power amplifier or pa with the highest rf transmit power and best linearity in cmos technology spark pa also supports wave  and wave  ac access point requirement multiuser mimo of x or x topologies as well as the future  qam modulation scheme during this past quarter we continue to enhance our offering and provide full front end solutions that incorporate our pa lna and switch we continue to engage with selected customers that are undergoing an evaluation phase of our pa and same products and now to an update of the cordless phone market all figures and comparison in this section are for cordless phone socs only and do not include revenues from gateways and iocs our third quarter cordless revenues continue to recover following the inventory correction earlier this year albeit at a slower pace than we originally anticipated cordless revenues declined by  yearoveryear but increased  on a sequential basis and accounted for  of third quarter revenues the yearoveryear decline was in line with the cordless phone market decline trend of  to  in the fourth quarter we anticipate that our cordless revenues will be down slightly on a sequential basis due to seasonal factors that remain below the  to  yearoveryear secular market decline trend as the gradual inventory adjustment recover continues and now to an update on our outlook based on our revenue expectations across our new product initiatives while taking in to consideration a sequential decline in hdclear and cordless telephony revenues we expect yearoveryear revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter although fourth quarter revenues will be down on a sequential basis we expect revenues for the fourth quarter of  to be in the range of  million to  million which at the midpoint of the range is just  yearoveryear increase to summarize we are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter which highlights solid execution that included revenue growth both sequentially and yearoveryear solid margin expansion both in our growth and operating line during the third quarter we successfully executed on our business objectives which are primarily focused on driving accelerated growth by expanding the market adoption of our new products in voice mobile and iot we also experience a gradual improvement in the cordless telephony segment during the quarter despite our expectation for a sequentially down fourth quarter we are optimistic that our business outlook for both the short and long term and as our new product across the three segments are more widely adopted in driving the increased demand we anticipate that these categories will comprise a majority of our revenues in  now i’d like to turn the call over to dror our chief financial officer dror the floor is yours dror levy thank you ofer i will now review the income statement for the third quarter of  from top to bottom for each line item i will provide the us gaap results as well as the equity based compensation expenses included in the line item and the

compensation expenses in the amount of  million and amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of  million our operating expenses for the quarter were net of  million of other income resulting from the lack of previous acquisition related provision due to the exploration of applicable statutes of limitation this reversal of provision has no cash flow effect on our quarter our financial income for the quarter was  million income tax expenses for the quarter were  million and included an income tax benefit resulting from the amortization of a deferred tax liability related to intangible assets to the amount of  million net income was  million including equity based compensation expenses of  million amortization intangible assets of  million other income from the reversal of provision in the amount of  million and a tax benefit resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability in the amount of  million nongaap net income excluding these items i’ve just described was  million gaap net income per share for this quarter was  a negative impact of equity based compensation expenses on the eps was  the negative impact towards the amortization of acquired intangible assets on eps was  the positive impact or the reversal of the provision on the eps was  the positive impact on the tax benefit resulting from amortization of deferred tax liability was  and the nongaap net income per share excluding the item i just described was  this is the current report on k that we filed with the sec this morning for a reconciliation of the nongaap presentation to the gaap presentation now turning to the balance sheet accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter of  increased to  million compared to  million at the end of the second quarter representing a level of  days of sales our inventory decreased from  million at the end of the second quarter to  million representing a level of  days our total cash and marketable securities decreased by  million during the third quarter and were at the level of  million as of september   our cash and marketable securities position during the quarter was affected by the following  million of cash was

acting as our representative for the last couple of years this acquisition brings our holding to  of this company and will help us to strengthen our strategic position in this region  million was used for repurchase of approximately  shares of our common stock at an average price of  per share  million of cash was received from exercise of option by employees and  million was a change in the market value and amortization of marketable securities now i would like to provide you with our projection for the fourth quarter of  our fourth quarter projections on the us gaap basis including the impact of equitybased compensation expenses and the acquisition related amortization expenses are as follows revenues are expected to be in the range of  million to  million we expect our gross margins to be

fourth quarter projections include approximately  million of amortization of intangible assets our fourth quarter projections also include the following amount focused on for equity based compensation expenses cost of goods include  million rd expenses include  million to  million and total operating expenses include  million to  million now we’d like to open up the line for questions and answers operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will now take our first question it comes from mr jaeson schmidt from lake street capital markets please go ahead your line is now open jaeson schmidt just a quick clarification on the new mobile win with a nonsmartphone application that’s in addition to the one you announced back in q as well ofer elyakim yes the win is an additional design win so one in q and the other one in q and as we’ve indicated we see a very nice market opportunity in the area of iot and smart sticker and a smart audio type of devices and we believe that this represents a very nice opportunity and a great fit for the offering that we have around voice user interface and all the announcements including noise cancellation to margin capabilities acoustic echo cancelling etcetera etcetera and of course always on voice which is becoming a critical factor to enable a voice user interface on battery operated devices jaeson schmidt and are you seeing anything different from a competitive landscape or selling strategy within that market compared to the traditional handset market ofer elyakim of course the smartphone market is fairly well established market place with fairly sizeable oems that have their generations of the product and the annual type launch schedule etcetera and on the other hand the iot market which includes a lot of the devices around iot from wearable to home type of devices and systems to some outdoor categories as well is a fairly new and vibrant market which today is evolving at a very fast pace with a lot of focus by all major oems and is expected to become a market which will have billions of units based on kind of what we see out there we see a tremendous amount of interest for what we and the technologies that we have developed as well as the product the silicon component that we have and the market dynamic is basically suggesting that  and devices like amazon echo are kind of leading the market and has created a new market nature that’s enabling people without any other interface just voice to do a perfect interaction and do search and listen all kinds of content and we believe that there is a great fit for what we have and there is as i said a tremendous amount of opportunity out there our focus continues to be on all the fronts from mobile to wearable to iot and we are doing our best to engage and take it to the finish line jaeson schmidt how should we think about opex trending next year are you guys going to need to make significant investment for some of these newer opportunities ofer elyakim i think that on the opex front as you’ve seen from last year to this year there were some incremental additional investment we expect to have to see some incremental additional investment going forward but nothing at a very large scale operator we would now take our next question it comes from mr matt ramsay from canaccord genuity please go ahead your line is now open matt ramsay very well done on the quarter congrats i guess on the guidance obviously there is the impact from samsung maybe you could help us quantify that a little bit in the mobile revenue for the fourth quarter and how you’re thinking about mobile revenue growth in to  ofer elyakim so around the guidance especially around mobile as you know we’ve indicated during the last quarter that our annual revenue goal was to be above  million for the year we did of course also expect a slower q than we actually had reported  the midpoint of our expectation was around  and this came ahead i believe as samsung began to ramp up in expectation of note  however the unfortunate termination of the model thus have an impact on our q number and what we hope that we will see in terms of demand in q the way we see going forward especially around the fourth quarter is that we are also in the galaxy s as one of the key vehicles for growth and this has been contributing most of our revenues this year that a lot of replacements will go to galaxy s and by that we will be able to benefit it very hard to call exactly how the demand will be in the fourth quarter of course right now it’s kind of more on the defensive side as there is a lot of blurring in the supply chain and uncertainty around the demand and what selfdetermination we’ll have and we will of course try to do our best to fulfill the demand and support the customer in the best way we can with respect to  i believe it it’s too early to quantify because we are in engagement process but we need that to be concluded in order to be able to provide better color on how should we think about mobile in to next year one thing that we are working on is the diversification to be able to get design wins with additional leading customers on a variety of segments and we have been updating you guys about the progress we’re making i do expect that we will make an additional progress in the quarters to come as we see a great fit what we have and what the market wants and i think what we’ve achieved in  and ’ is a great plan to enable us to monetize the momentum in to the market demand as well as in to additional smartphone and customers and wearable vendors matt ramsay thank you for the color that’s helpful i understand the situation at samsung was certainly not  no one was really able to forecast that so i appreciate that outside of that mobile part of the business maybe you could talk a little bit about visibility i know it’s always a challenge in the home telephony back to markets but the seasonality this year as you guys have talked about a recovery in the back half of the year was maybe a hair different that i had modeled but maybe you could talk a little about trends you’re seeing there and the health of the channel in that market going in to the fourth quarter and in to next year that would really help thank you ofer elyakim so around quarter’s telephony so as a general benchmark for all this market and again the benchmark is really based on what we see coming from the point of sale data and the key to end markets one is north america and the other one is europe we see a market decline rate of about  to  i would say europe is more towards a high single digit us is more in the low to midteens and that has not changed what has changed is really the health of the supply chain and as you know we’re starting in late third early fourth quarter of  going in to the first quarter of  we saw a major inventory correction cycle that started in the north america market and then moved to the european market and from second quarter we are in a gradual improvement mode that we expect to continue as we said you’ve seen a sequential increases in q to q and we see right now slightly sequentially down but that doesn’t really change the picture the gradual improvement is ongoing and we believe that this will continue about what to expect in to next year assuming the secular trends to not change and where we are this year it was not as that different if we have to look back in to the trends of  or ’ this was the level we expect this if we take in to account that these levels would change we hope to see a reversion to the main somewhat right like if you take a look at our revenues for this year they are down in the north of  for quarters if we take nine months actual plus the guidance that we gave so hope to see better trends next year at the end of the day there should be a reversion to where the market is and the market is  to  down operator we will take our next question it comes from mr matt robinson from wunderlich please go ahead your line is open matt robinson on the voice activation design wins are they all with customers that have cloud resources for speech recognition ofer elyakim so around the additional design wins in mobile and mainly you’re asking about the nonmobile design wins as we’ve announced so these are with products coming i would say from iot smart speaker wearable type of front i would say the majority of wins are with companies that do have a cloud and some of these products are actually going to be a cloud operated but some could also be operated in a standalone model through additional connectivity capabilities i think that as we look at our pipeline and the opportunity to fly ahead it is basically a mix of both connected or cloud based type of voice engines and the ability to voice user interface and naturally speaking and also some ability to run a limited voice user interface vocabulary locally so i would say there is a good mix of that like when we look at the opportunities out there on both ends but there is also a lot of interest around how do we enhance the capabilities of voice to be heard with noises with the fact that many of these devices also carry in addition to microphone speakers and how do you support barging how do you do good acoustic echo cancellation a lot of these types of dynamics of making voice just better and making it work with very good performance so that  from the threshold of user experience it will basically be able to meet where the market leading machines are the real benchmark is of course alexa or amazon echo matt robinson have they gotten very far along in coming up with interface mechanisms to enable the supply chain to offer customer premise devices that are fully viable for facing the cloud obviously the smartphone universe has gotten pretty good there but just curious how far along the residential type functions have gone or if its pretty cut and dry ofer elyakim i think there’s a very big difference between oems are trying to achieve on the premise equipment or the residential market and the industrial market and what we have today is smartphone which is a much more of a near filed type of an interaction typically you’re within a yard or so from your phone but in the residential or industrial type of environment first of all you are prone to many kind of noises that in a smartphone sim you have let’s say hopefully more control or at least an alternative user interface and number two is the distance from the device itself and how does it need to work when there is perhaps several other people in the same room subject to noises reverberations etcetera etcetera while you are fairly far away from the device so all of that accounts for additional used cases and another hurdle in terms of enabling better performance from voice user interface on these types of new devices i hope that helps matt robinson but what’s the timeframe for these guys to get in to production with your initial designs ofer elyakim right now the way we see these gradually throughout ’ i’d say the best way to model it is that these devices move to production in the middle of the year or so matt robinson and how should we think about the market size for this is it comparable to home gateway to over a period of some years ofer elyakim i think that the opportunity is much greater than where we are in home gateways today over the years we are right now at the starting line so we’ve just started these diversifications and started getting design wins and we have a fairly nice pipeline of engagement that we are working on but the opportunity is by far larger than gateways even the units that we see today and we have a belief that this is what we see a lot of from the market research by talking to customers their expectations are for this market to grow fairly rapidly matt robinson you mentioned certain times talking about spark which was a nice update is there  have you had any progress in the last quarter it seems like we’re kind of looking for something maybe by the end of next year for production but that’s far enough out it seems like it’s a pretty uncertain estimate is there any  can you talk about the progress if anything there’s been in the last quarter ofer elyakim yes absolutely we did make a significant progress during the last six months as this product started to sample and get evaluated by customers or by potential customers and our goal as we’ve indicated is to see revenues in ’ and so for that we need to land the design win during the next six months to make it to production in to ’ where we are definitely is engagement process with a number of vendors some of them are more on the wifi subsystem to be part of the reference design and some are direct engagement with an oem to be the pa or a fan in a future solution so on both ends we’re making progress in terms of the engagement side and what we need to do is carry that through the finish line or to be either a land of designing or be far to the reference design that will enable us to move to of course move to the next step which will be to start commercial shipments and realize revenues so right now we believe that by late  there seems to be right now a goal to see revenue or an initial shipments from the spark pa operator we will now take our next question it comes from charlie anderson from dougherty  company please go ahead your line is now open charlie anderson i wanted to focus on really strong gross margin performance i wondered if you could speak to like for like margins was there any change there on products or was that just a feature of mix and then moving forward the sustainability of some of these margins and the long term margin model if you want to talk about that that would be great ofer elyakim on gross margins i think we’ve indicated that our near term goals are to move in to mids we have over the last three years we’ve kind of gradually step by step saw these margin improvement cycle happening from high s in to the low s and now this third quarter of course represent a near term high  and i think this is where we want to be at these mids of course it will be really hard to estimate accurately every quarter as you know this is of course a calculation based on the mix of products and that each and every one of them has its own margin profile but the real dynamic behind it is the fact that our new products which are of course  there’s a very strong correlation and not by case because our new products are carrying a much better gross margins than our cordless telephony products and as these revenues are representing a bigger part of the mix and as our revenues grow and in our cost of good some of our cost of goods are fixed so as revenues grow the fixed cost becomes less meaningful all of that contributes to strengthening in gross margins and we hope that we are definitely staying in kind of mids with respect to moving beyond the mids i think that we will need to see revenue growth associated also with business and once we see that that could help us to focus and realize better margins but right now i would say that we want to be at the area of mids and i hope that we are there and all of that is of course benefiting from the new product category which as i said a much higher margins than the cordless telephony business charlie anderson and then want to focus on voip for a second i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in addition to a customer ramp a little bit earlier in q there was also general market strength and i wondered if you could address that what you’re seeing in that market in terms of overall demand and size of the market ofer elyakim on the voiceoverip market indeed when we reported second quarter results our expectations were for a lower type of revenue quarter and we gave  million to  million or  million at the midpoint right now we’ve reported  million what we’re seeing is just the buildup of lead times all those etcetera and all of that translates to the quarterly revenues i think that the overall picture has not changed a bit we have said for us it is a strong market that we can become the market leader we have all the tools and technologies and capabilities to be the soc in this market and i think what we have done is really focused on getting designs wins and building the strong pipeline thereafter that is translating to a commercial shipment and of course that fulfills revenue etcetera etcetera our view has not changed this is a market of  million or north in soc value and we are only i would say less than onethird of the way in to the penetration this year we expect as you can understand from the guidance so also from the actual highs i believe that this will continue to be growth market for us in the next couple of years and it will translate as these new tier one oems prove out full annual type of shipment volume which is very different let’s say than the ramp up which is always a gamble between how much inventory they have of the old silicon product versus how much they will take from the new design and once we’re pass these rounds we’ll hopefully see the full run rate and that of course will translate to further revenue growth and we hope that with a design pipeline that we have more launches will happen in  which will fuel additional growth in ’ and so on and so forth so for us this continues to be a very strong and promising market opportunity and i think right now we have the most comprehensive set of solutions and soc to capture these opportunities operator we will now take our next question suji desilva roth capital please go ahead your line is now open suji desilva on the mobile i just want to understand the support intensity of some of these wins and your ability to support additional wins or the customers you’ve won to date requires you guys to focus fairly heavily or is this scalable with the support you have to scale to more mobile wins ofer elyakim around the mobile wins as you know from the very beginning our offering around the hdclear was around silicon and a lot of softer algorithms including noise suppression acoustic echo cancellation always onvoice with very low power consumption all of these ingredients are highly sought after both in where we are today handsets as well as in the ioc segments or as we say smart speakers wearable and other ioc products and i think that there’s very strong correlation between what we have and what customers need of course the ability to branch out and support more engagement with new customers and all of the customers that we are supporting and the two customers that we’ve included in our announcement and also in the previous quarter and our new customers and of course to support these new oems and make sure we are successful and they are successful doesn’t tell a strong commitment from our side but i would say that we are well positioned to tackle and win and broaden the pipeline of designs of customers that we are actively supporting and i think we’re getting to where there’s a lot of commonality between what each of these customers’ needs from us and also what we have on hand in terms of development i think we will be successful in handling and fulfilling the needs that are necessary by the customers and with our technology and support suji desilva good now looking for the diversification there and then on the pa product in particular what is the timing of customer wins being secured for the product i know it’s a later ramp but i’m curious what timeframe is for the design wins there ofer elyakim so what we’ve indicated is right now there is an engagement an active engagement process going on with both the wifi subsystems and as well as we’ve been with customers mainly around access points and mainly are also high end and the way we’re thinking about it is that these need to continue in to designing design wins probably in to the next year and hopefully in order to be in production and actually secure revenues we hope that these will concluding design wins i would say early second half or so and that could then translate to revenues as you know in the pa market or at least these are more of components there’s no software associated with the design timeline or let’s say from design win to production is more a hardware type of an exercise rather than a full system software type of an exercise so it’s inaudible big time than what we have in most of our other products suji desilva understood and then a last quick question what’s the typical q seasonality we should be thinking about ofer elyakim suji can you ask the question again it was about  suji desilva sure the typical seasonality you see in the first quarter on average ofer elyakim it’s very hard to call the quarters but i would say that every year has been different we could see that seasonality will be down in to the first quarter a lot of it is going to depend on how exactly the mix is i would say quarters does depend on how holiday season concludes in europe and the us in addition we have seen i would say in the last two years that voiceoverip starts the year on the low end and gradually improves and we’ve seen that in  and also in  so that’s perhaps the way to think about the seasonality next year operator operator instructions we will now take our next question it comes from mr robert mertens from needham  company please go ahead sir your line is now open robert mertens hi this is robert mertens on behalf rajvindra gill first congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question you mentioned earlier that the internet of things revenue was expected to be higher than previous guidance for the year i believe within the home automation segment could you give me a little bit more clarity on the momentum within this product launch ofer elyakim so around the iot or  of course its mainly around technology which is called ule which is a connectivity technology for smartphone monitoring security etcetera the way we modeled or at least our expectation coming in to the year was for about  million to  million of revenues in the iot segment but what we’re seeing is that there is a momentum of very nice demand which is kind of requested in to the fourth quarter in expectation for a smart home service launch by two leading service provider and that of course creates some upside in to the fourth quarter or let’s say better than expected in the fourth quarter that makes us optimistic about our ability to surpass this expectation of  million to  million the way this iot business is layered is through existing designs that have translated to retail product launches and some other service provider wins that have translated to commercial shipment and the way the buildup will happen is by additional  either consumer type of oem that we launched kind of a home in the box or a security system in the box and then place it in retail or by leading service providers that we launch in a more managed type of services that will be offered to their subscriber base and through getting more subscribers if this is going to help them out to be growing and right now what we are seeing is that there will be two meaningful service provider launches that should carry ule revenues up to the next level and right now we see the beginning of that trend taking place operator we have no further questions in the queue mr amir i’d like now to turn the conference

our first quarter  earnings conference call on todays call we will also have with us mr ofer elyakim chief executive officer and mr dror levy chief financial officer before we begin i would like to remind you that during this conference call we will be making forwardlooking statements about our financial projections for the second quarter of  including by segment preliminary composition of revenues for  anticipated gross margin improvements gradual recovery of the cordless business and the anticipated general annual secular decline of such business our ability to secure additional design wins mass production timetables and result revenues and general market demand for products and incorporated technologies in the market we assume no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements for more information about the risks and factors that could affect the forwardlooking statements made herein please refer to the risk factors discussed in our  form k and other sec reports we have filed now i would like to turn the call over to ofer elyakim our chief executive officer ofer the floor is yours ofer elyakim thank you daniel good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i hope that you had the opportunity to read our press release that we distributed earlier today i would like to begin by reviewing our results for the first quarter commenting on the progression of our business plan and providing context for our outlook in a short while dror will provide you with detailed comments on our financial results and outlook for the second quarter of  we achieved first quarter financial results that were ahead of guidance on most metrics our performance reflects continued execution of our new product strategy as evidenced by solid yearoveryear revenue growth of  in office voip segment and  for our iot products respectively and reflected in the  basis points improvement in nongaap gross margin we ended the quarter with total revenues of  million representing an increase of  versus the first quarter of  despite an expected revenue shortfall in our mobile business as higher revenues in voip iot and cordless sufficiently offset this decline new products revenues were  million and accounted for  of sales new product revenues declined by  yearoveryear and by  sequentially hurt by the temporary weakness in our mobile segment we believe that our first quarter was a revenue trough for the year and expect our revenues to gradually improve from this level looking forward we expect a sequential revenue increase in the second quarter propelled by improvements in new product revenues and increased demands for cordless telephony socs specifically we believe that we are seeing early signs of revenue recovery in our mobile segment as the design wins we have announced in previous quarters are expected to reach commercial shipments earlier than initially anticipated moreover we are excited about the numerous opportunities and engagements that we are addressing in each of the new product segments namely voip iot and mobile that are expected to materialize into revenues in the second half of  and beyond now i would like to provide specific update about our progress in each segment starting with mobile during the quarter sales of hdclear products totaled  million the lower revenues were expected and mainly an outcome of much softer demand from our tier  mobile customer nevertheless we are working diligently to diversify and reinvigorate our mobile business and we are happy to inform you that during the first quarter we secured an additional design win for a nonsmartphone application with a leading north american oem for a product that is expected to launch in the second half of this year in addition we had a number of noteworthy announcements including a partnership with stmicroelectronics a global semiconductor leader by revealing a new smart microphone which is power efficient and delivers keyword detection capabilities in a compact package for small batteryoperated devices incorporating our hdclear technology second with liberty wireless a leading embedded wifi and wireless solution provider that integrated our dect and voice activation solutions into its voice assistant speaker to enable telephony calls this feature is in high demand for smart speaker vendors that would like to marry smart speakers artificial intelligence and telephony capabilities the third was with emza visual sense a developer of miniature machine vision devices that announced the industrys first batterypowered intelligent computer vision alwayson visual sensor for residential security and smart building application which is based on our hdclear technology looking ahead to the second quarter we anticipate a sequential increase in our mobile revenues as we begin shipments to two known smartphone oems based on our assessments we project second quarter mobile revenues to be in the range of  million to  million and more importantly we are uniquely positioned to become a leader in the burgeoning markets for voice user interface leveraging our proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and lowpower design we have successfully built a promising and diverse engagement pipeline with leading oems covering a variety of application ranging from smartphones smart audio to iot application this pipeline is just starting to materialize and paving a promising path to future growth now moving to the voip and office segments in the first quarter we achieved quarterly revenues of  million representing an increase of  yearoveryear and up  sequentially during the quarter one of our leading tier  customers began shipments of its new conferencing system based on our dvf and dcx socs second another tier  customer launched a new series of premium ip phones based on our dvf soc these product launches go handinhand with our anticipation for increased traction with tier  customers and an expansion of the addressable market we are confident that with our current product roadmap and design pipeline we are well positioned to see solid revenue growth this year and beyond for the second quarter we expect voip revenues to grow on a sequential basis and to be in the range of  million to  million now to an update on the home segment which includes home gateways iot and cordless i will start with home gateways first quarter home gateway revenues were  million up by  sequentially and roughly flat year over year we continue to see solid traction from telecom service providers interested in integrating highdefinition voice into their home gateways and during this quarter too a new european service provider has launched gateways incorporating our dectcatiq solution proximus belgiums largest telco and sunrise a leading telecom operator in switzerland started shipping dect enabled on gateways based on our technology we expect second quarter home gateway revenues to increase on a sequential basis to  million and  million and to further accelerate as the year progresses coinciding with new product launches by a number of new telecom service providers turning now to iot during the first quarter we generated revenues of  million from our iot products representing growth of  year over year and a  decrease on a sequential basis following an expected pause by a large european telco that builds strong inventory already in the fourth quarter of last year we are excited to share with you that during the quarter qivicon deutsche telekoms smartphone platform launched its homebased two gateways its an iot hub that incorporates our dect ule technology in connection with the product launch the new qivicon gateways are offered with bundled ulebased sensors and based on our check these new products are wellreceived in the german market moreover propelled by the recent ulebased smarthome launches by leading service providers we are experiencing increased interest and strong momentum for ule technology and consequently a continued expansion in our iot ecosystem as an example leedarson the world leader in iot product manufacturing has announced that it decided to integrate ule into its lighting solutions security and intelligent lighting controls all using our ule model enabling fast timetomarket and easy integration moreover we are seeing growing interest in adding voices or interface to iot sensors the voice is viewed as the prevailing user interface for the smart home environment this represents another meaningful growth opportunity as our offering includes all the necessary building blocks for voice user interface and wireless connectivity ule technology is designed to support highquality twoway voice and video and bestinclass range and propagation interferencefree looking at the second quarter we expect iot revenues to grow on a sequential basis and to be in the range of  million to  million in summary we began the year with a record number of iot programs concentrated on leading service providers and oems we anticipate the strong momentum to continue during the remainder of  and to generate solid revenue growth and now for an update on the cordless phone market our first quarter cordless revenues were in line with our guidance for modest yearoveryear improvement cordless revenues increased by  year over year recovering from the inventory correction we experienced in the first quarter of  and declined by  on a sequential basis and accounted for  of first quarter total revenues for the second quarter we expect cordless revenues to be more aligned with the general cordless market decline of approximately  to  on an annual basis and now to an update on our outlook based on our revenue expectations across our new product initiatives we expect our second quarter  revenues to be in the range of  million to  million which at the midpoint of the guidance was just solid sequential growth looking ahead we are very excited with our future prospects and are uniquely positioned to live and thrive in the burgeoning market for voice user interface moreover we believe that our new product strategy will continue to position us well for a longterm revenue growth and positively contribute to the bottom line now id like to turn the call over to dror our chief financial officer dror the floor is yours dror levy thank you ofer i will now review the income statement for the first quarter of  from top to bottom for each line item i will provide the us gaap results as well as the equitybased compensation expenses included in that line item and expenses related to previous acquisitions our revenues for the first quarter of  were  million gross margin for the quarter was  gross margin for the quarter included equitybased compensation expenses in the amount of  million rd expenses were  million including equitybased compensation expenses in the amount of  million operating expenses for the quarter were  million including equitybased compensation expenses in the amount of  million and amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of  million financial income for the quarter was  million income tax for the quarter included tax benefit in the amount of  million resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets and the tax benefits related to equitybased compensation the tax benefit for the quarter excluding these items was in the amount of  million net loss was  million including equitybased compensation expenses of  million amortization of intangible assets of  million and tax benefit in the amount of  million nongaap net loss excluding these items i just described was  million gaap loss per share for the quarter was  the negative impact of equitybased compensation expenses on the loss per share was  the negative impact on the amortization of acquired intangible assets was  and the positive impact of the tax benefit was  nongaap loss per share excluding the item i just described was  please see the current report on form k that we filed with the sec this morning for a full reconciliation of the nongaap presentation to the gaap presentation now turning to the balance sheet accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of  decreased to  million compared to  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  representing a level of  days of sales inventory decreased from  million at the end of the fourth quarter to  million representing a level of  days our cash and marketable securities decreased by  million during the first quarter and were in the level of  million as of the end of march our cash and marketable securities position during the quarter was affected by the following  million of cash was used for operations representing mostly working capital changes  million of cash was used for purchase of property and equipment  million was used for repurchase of approximately  shares of our common stock at an average price of  per share and  million of cash was received from exercises of options by employees now i would like to provide you with our projections for the second quarter of  our second quarter projections on us gaap basis including impact of equitybased compensation expenses and acquisitionrelated amortization expenses are as follows revenues are expected to be in the range of  million to  million we expect our gross margin to be in the range of  and  rd expenses are expected to be in the range of  million to  million operating expenses are expected to be in the range of  million and  million financial income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million provision for income taxes for the second quarter is expected to be approximately  million on a pro forma basis our share outstanding are expected to be approximately  million shares on a gaap basis and  million shares on fully diluted nongaap basis our second quarter projections include approximately  million of amortization of intangible assets our second quarter projections also include the following amount forecasted for equitybased compensation expenses cost of goods include approximately  million rd expenses include  million to  million and operating expenses include  million to  million and now wed like to open up the line for questions and answers operator please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will now take our first question from jaeson schmidt from lake capital markets jaeson schmidt hey guys thanks for taking my questions wondering if you could just talk about the competitive landscape youre seeing in mobile and some of the reasons why youre finding so much success against your competitor in nonhandset applications ofer elyakim yes jaeson and thank you for the question so regarding the competitive landscape look first of all we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio today of these type of processors ranging from more of the high performance with the ability to process a lot of different algorithms that could be either our own or the oems as well as ultralow processors that could basically enable any device to do alwayson voice and to incorporate voice user interface  acting or being activated by a battery so i think that first of all we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio number two i think that the portfolio of the algorithms that we provide are achieving to date a very good performance and being recognized by the market and i think that were also today enabling a lot of devices starting from smartphones and going into wearable products smart watches into kind of smart speakers and iot so all of that is i think a pretty unique proposition with respect to the other vendors of course this domain is attracting many additional software vendors algorithm vendors and also silicon tech providers but we do see that we are actually seeing a very nice traction and success in a variety of a different products and we hope to continue with this momentum and then thrive and grow jaeson schmidt okay thats helpful and just following up on that i think in last quarter you mentioned your outlook for mobile was in that  million to  million range are you guys still expecting revenue to be in that ballpark ofer elyakim yes yes we are i think thats a fair kind of range for the year jaeson schmidt and then the last one from me and ill jump back into queue how should we think about opex trending going forward ofer elyakim so i think that the  with the opex guide that we provided for this  for the second quarter you can see that kind of the midpoint of that dror levy the midpoint is around  million pro forma which is slightly lower than when we were in q and for the second half of the year it should be more or less in the same range  million per quarter operator we will now take our next question from robert mertens from needham  company robert mertens sorry about that thank you for taking my question i just wanted to get a little bit more clarity about how we should think about cash flow and if youre thinking about anymore of share buyback dror levy yes so im going to start with the cash flow so the cash flow for the first quarter was negative and this is also a phenomena that we had in the first quarter of last year however we do expect that for the remainder of the year and for sure for the year as a whole we will have a positive cash flow so in the last couple of years our cash flow indiscernible and was even like higher than our ebitda so i would believe that this will also be the trend for this year and in terms of buybacks we had the latest authorization was if i recall for  we got authorization for  million worth of shares out of which up until the end of the quarter we did around  million so as of today as of the end of the quarter we still had about  million of authorization for buyback and i assume that well need to deal with that and to increase it sometime during the second quarter operator we will now take our next question from rajvi gill from needham  company rajvindra gill thank you for taking my questions and congrats on good results with solid execution the question i had on the opex just a follow up how much kind of opex savings are you expected to generate from the closure of the pa business and can you maybe describe the savings from the closure of that particular segment line dror levy yes so first this is already included in the numbers that we have provided so as the second quarter being at  million which is slightly lower than the first quarter this already takes into account this closure of this activity overall this activity consumed i would say couple of million even less than that  not more than  million to  million per year and less than that so this should not have a significant impact on the opex rajvindra gill all right thats included and if you look at  if were looking at the voice over ip market i just wanted to get a sense of the  your current market share and your expectations for that market share going forward you talked about in the past that the enterprise voice over ip sam is in the  million to  million per year and thats growing at a  or  cagr and i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the market share dynamics across broadcom and ti and yourself and how we should be looking at kind of the longterm growth rate in that business ofer elyakim yes hi rajvi this is ofer with respect to the market so yes youre correct about the kind of the sizing of the market that we said its about  million in silicon soc value and the market is growing on at the eccentrics or kind of the uca side of the cloudbased voice over ip or voice and video services and in a way its kind of more in the kind of flattish to maybe slightly growing or around that trend in the onprem side which is kind of the large enterprise market and we are and have been during the last couple of years increasing our market share pretty gradually as weve entered really from the lowend side which suggests kind of lower asp type of a product for our first few and as we continue and expand our market share and grow were actually kind of getting into more of the midrange highend product and then were in a way improving the asp so if you were to ask me around kind of what is our market share today on the unit volume perspective i would say its around  if you asked me about what is the  what is our market share on the revenue side i would say its kind of more in the s and so it means that we have a lot of room still to grow the market is a market that is characterized by low turnover so each product that is in the market lasts for a number of the year and hence also the design cycle is fairly slow we still see competition from the other two vendors that youve mentioned mainly broadcom but we believe that today we have by far and large the most comprehensive set of solutions for this market all the right and necessary focus from the software side the algorithm side and the voice engine side so i think we are really kind of uniquely positioned to continue and expand and be the market leader in this market so we have got a very good feeling about our future in this market rajvindra gill thats helpful and the other question i had was if you can be maybe elaborate on your partnership with emza visual sense to create this alwayson intelligent vision sensor for security monitoring  smart city monitoring another semiconductor company himax is also working with them so i was wondering kind of what was the rationale for the partnership and how you think we should kind of look at the opportunity in computer vision and what youre bringing to the table with respect to that partnership ofer elyakim so first of all the relationship and the partnership is about marrying the unique silicon design that we have in one of our mobiletargeted socs which basically can run very efficiently and effectively algorithms at a very low power and in a way enable the alwayson functionality and this is mainly kind of desired if you want to make batteryoperated devices utilize this type of characteristics for processes to run always and do that very efficiently and in a way emza brings in their expertise on the more of the isp side so the imaging processing front were great believers in this front or via visual sensing and processing and i think that this is a market and a trend that we will continue to be very focused on and continue to do that via forming partnerships or doing our own investments and i think that were also well positioned there rajvindra gill and just last question from me and ill hop back on and this is a follow up as well on the competitive landscape so i just wanted to get is  try to get a sense in terms of your  how youre distinguishing between your lowpower voice processors where you are competing with companies like cirrus logic and the entry into noise cancellation market where you see digital headsets now or adapted noise cancellation headsets starting to include noise cancellation codecs which is a pretty untapped market most of these headphones headsets or analog so theres some transition from analog headsets to digital headsets which has a lot of software algorithms based on that so i just wanted to get a sense of how we should distinguish between the lowpowered voice processor and noise cancellation or they are all kind of part and parcel of the larger product portfolio ofer elyakim yes rajvi thank you so  yes indeed maybe some clarification is required here just to avoid the confusion so when we look at the voice user interface domain were talking about connecting microphones which in a way are supposed to be always on and looking for a voice command looking for the speaker to use a certain trigger and then after that activate the device and start processing speech and going to the cloud or going locally converting it back to text then using nlp and all kinds of additional other algorithms and in this market its really about connecting microphones a processor and then working together with the speaker so that you can actually achieve a very good accuracy when the trigger word is being announced and then also create a great experience for the noise cancellation front whether its ambient noise in the room whether its noise coming from the speaker while a person is speaking to the microphone via acoustical echo cancellation and all kinds of other technologies and algorithms and in this market it ranges from very low power batteryoperated device the single microphone two microphones to a high power high processing multimicrophones beam forming et cetera so in a way we support all the use cases from kind of a near field midfield and also far field and so this is kind of one market and in this market you can categorize smartphone smart watches smart speakers all kinds of iot devices that are incorporating voice activation automotive as well and in the other part of your questions when you really address the headset market and rightfully saying that in a way there is today a trend of conversions from analog to digital here i believe youre  when you say noise cancellation you mainly mean anc which is more of the active noise cancellation or just trying to cancel noise by kind of creating an inverse signal to benefit the person who is using the headset and in that market today what we have is more of the far field noise cancellation and less the anc but of course these features and requirements is part of our roadmap and part of our initiative on the audio codec front and to go further into this market i would say that the demand and requirement today for digital headset is on the rise but it is a fairly small base today as you know mainly one maybe  vendors are today embracing this trend of a digital type of connection of the headset into the phone but of course it is part of where we want to be and i think that in the next couple of years youre going to see us also incorporating these capabilities which is very close to where were coming from we have and we still today a lot of these kind of highquality analog stuff in every voice over ip phone in every video conferencing phone and every even desk phone operator we will now take our next question from matt ramsay from canaccord matt ramsay i just wanted to ask a little bit over about the integration or the overlap between voip business and the emerging ule or iot business particularly hdclear and ule products for voiceactivated or voicecontrolled iot or connected home applications and just wanted to understand a little bit more the strategy of bringing the product to market and is that a clear differentiator for your ule program as it starts to ramp into bigger volumes over time ofer elyakim hi matt and thanks for the great question so this is indeed i would say kind of one of the key themes that we do see around iot is the understanding that its not just about processing connectivity sensing its also about the ability to control and activate and when we look at smart homes or smart offices et cetera i think kind of the  we see a consensus coming from all the vendors ranging from the oems themselves to the service providers that are in a way kind of designing the next services and are truly trying to find what is the best way thats going to  consumers will start embracing these devices and methods and i think kind of the consensus is that the voice is going to be the prevailing user interface we see that  in a way kind of technology has made a  its kind of ripe and ready and the performance is really good and you can see it in devices like amazon echo and the google home and the way they understand and get kind of keywords and are able to process commands and convert them into text in natural language so i think this is kind of where the world of smart home and smart offices is heading and i think that by combining both ule which is a protocol or a technology that was made for kind of always for real time always type of communication supporting voice two way et cetera is uniquely positioned both from the fact that it supports great range so it means that you can really be mobile and roaming through kind of your apartment home backyard et cetera and still be able to connect and continue the dialogue you can do that interferencefree which is one of the key assets that the ule technology has so that means that there is no interference at all with any other short range wireless technology and on the other side when we go now into the voice activation side we do it at very low power assumption we have today a great ecosystem of additional device vendors ranging from all kinds of smart mix to our own solutions to our capabilities to drive also all the algorithms for far field and noise cancellation so all of that kind of bundles into a pretty comprehensive package that we believe kind of will carry ule forward and you know the embracement of this technology will also include a lot of voice activation and pretty much adding the microphone and the speaker to every sensor matt ramsay thats really interesting for context and thank you for that i guess my followup question is just a bigger picture one with some of the headwinds in the mobile business here in the very near term the growth as a percentage of the company of the new products has stagnated a bit but obviously the intention is for those new products to become the vast majority of business over the next few years but if you could just  either of you guys give a bit of an outlook for the next few years as to where you think that mix goes and just a reminder of what that means for the gross margin for the company because things have moved around and perturbated a bit here with some of the disruptions at samsung but i think the overall track of the business seems to be moving in that  in the right direction and just understanding that timing of that mix shift is important in the longerterm i appreciate the color ofer elyakim yes matt thanks so with respect to more kind of longerterm guidance of course were not giving kind of any guidance for the next couple of years but just to bring things into context so what weve said also in the prepared remarks is that right now were very excited about where the future is taking us and especially in the mobile segment and this is a domain where we did see some headwinds  some temporary headwinds that we predicted in the first half and also when you kind of look at our guide for  versus the results that we achieved in  that also suggest some weakness but we have been able to successfully get a pretty extensive set of design wins as well as a fairly i would say promising engagement with leading oems and were going to see that translate into significant growth in the next two years so were very excited and believe that the pipeline has never been more promising so were really really excited with the where the future is going to take us and i think that its very different from where we were in  having just one big customer we have today a fairly diversified pipeline and that is also going to be the case in  and  and i think as we said we are a fairly fortunate and uniquely positioned to have all the technology and all the capabilities and really fit very well in these voice user interface domain i think weve demonstrated that we are able in any type of  voice processing type of market to build the right portfolio solution and then get the right market strategy get the designing in place and drive revenue and i think this market is also a market that fits really well with the technologies and the products that we have and we see that happening we see that coming and just perhaps takes some patience to see that in revenue growth and  but i would say that right now the pipeline is looking really really promising operator we will now take our next question from scott searle from benchmark scott searle just a quick followup on the voip business and then i had a couple of additional questions but could you comment on avaya there have been some headwinds and concerns over the last several months if youre starting to see that recover and pick up and were kind of through the woods on that front ofer elyakim hi scott and welcome to the call yes so the question was on voip as you can tell since the second half of last year we had seen some weakness in one of kind of these new tier  oems that started to ship in mass production with our dvf soc it was avaya and of course the recent announcement and the status today that suggested that there are some headwinds and we are seeing some of that but we are hopeful and i think we do see some recovery ahead and nothing is stepping stone but i think kind of the momentum or at least kind of the trend over the last couple of weeks months has been on the positive front and we do hope that avaya will continue to be successful and we will see our designs and the products that were shipping today reach nice volume i would say though that today the portfolio of voice over ip solutions that we have and the way theyre translated into designs and shipments across the different vendors and skus et cetera makes us pretty  kind of diversified and so today we have kind of very  fairly good coverage on the onprem side we have fairly good coverage also on the uca side or the cloudbased type of voip front so in a way you can understand that this is a market where if one company has temporary weakness then others are beneficiaries and so i would say that we are designed fairly well of course in the future things can happen but so far i think weve been fairly successful in winning more business i think were  weve been diversifying and adding a lot more customers and designs the focus still is on kind of the tier s of this market and we hope to see continued progress and gradual growth over the next quarters scott searle and then just a follow up on hdclear front it sounds like its very exciting in terms of the pipeline building there its a diverse set of customers but i was wondering if we could get some more granularity in terms of some of the end product categories i know its been a lot of talk about alexalike devices but i thought i heard smart watch in there and i know youve or i thought you were engaging as well with some additional smartphone vendors so how thats kind of parsing out if you will and maybe  and this is possibly dangerous territory but the design wins that youre getting kind of the dollar amounts that are attached with that if these products actually go into production and then to followup on one of the earlier questions as well it seems like there is some combination with ule bundling im wondering how much of the hdclear success and traction now was coming from bundling on the ule front ofer elyakim so with respect to the kind of the key categories where hdclear designs are focused on so theyre focused on smartphones and today we are shipping with the galaxy s which is one of the kind of the key products that we go design into in the smart watch category we were  we did  we have been designed into the gear product that are shipping and this was shipping already since late  and now we are  weve started also shipments that we  with two new oems that are basically shipping devices that are more kind of in the smart speaker smart audio type of front and we believe that the kind of portfolio of different solutions or different end products is going to continue and expand to all kinds of kind of activity type of gear to a more smart speakers and more a kind of iot smart home type of applications more smartphones and so the voice user interface is basically touching every device in the market and the batteryoperated ones do require a fairly efficient voice processor that will basically connect the microphones and provide all the capabilities to the larger devices that do  that wont function and create a great user experience will require a lot of mics and processing capabilities and also for that today we have good solutions that meet these requirements we believe that this product category will despite the kind of the weakness that weve encountered is a growth  is a solid growth category that has a lot of potential starting this year with these new products that are starting shipping and to gradually grow and we would see a lot of more product that are and a lot more oems that are selecting our solutions and we see a very good future for this category scott searle last question just on the gross margin front it sounds like there was wide range there  to  im assuming some of that potential uptick is related to voip but wondering if there are any other mix issues or anything to be aware of thats kind of impacting that range dror levy no this is dror so i would say that this would depend somewhat on the range and also in the level of revenues as you know we do have like a portion of the gross margin that is a result of fixed expenses so the higher the total revenues are this portion has like smaller in terms of percentages so i would say these are the two things the mix and the total revenue operator we will now take our next question from matt robison from wunderlich matt robinson a couple of questions one is in the babble of the local area interfaces and iot interfaces have you  can you kind of describe the progress of ule over the past year or so versus the three or four or maybe more other interfaces that are kind of vying for these applications and if there has been a particular milestone that has led to relative success for ule and the other question i had is as it relates to hdclear and mobile it seems like sometimes the two are used interchangeably where that  i believe in essence mobile is sort of a subset of the hdclear opportunity i wanted to clarify if you said in your earlier comments that you had a mobile device design win thats starting this year or if that  if its more just some of the other broader scope of hdclear opportunities that youve been more specific about ofer elyakim yes matt thanks so let’s talk first with ule so ule was a technology that dspg and some other silicon vendors that had root injected develop and kind of the technology kind of went live in   and kind of the general competition was for kind of the last meter of iot so this is a short range that wireless that is supposed to connect devices mainly kind of indoors offices homes buildings et cetera and kind of the most immediate competition were standards like  or i would say established standards like zigbee zwave and then over the years what we have and also the other kind of ecosystem partners have tried to do is really make a market and prove the use of the  that the use of ule actually does solve a lot of issues that others have encountered in this domain and i think that ule was able and was very successful to address two key things the first one was to show that range is not a problem indoor range is something that you can very easily address by utilizing ule and this is very different in the other technologies the other issue is that this technology solved was the interference issue and when you have two technologies that are interfering its impossible to solve unless its really solved at the silicon level and that is not only just by a single vendor thats kind of an industrywide type of a solution and in technologies that operate in high sam ph band its pretty much impossible that these technologies will always be very friendly to one another because technologies are something that are in constant development and so dect ule because it operates on a licensed spectrum because its the only shortrange wireless technology to operate in this frequency band does guarantee very high stability and no interference so i think these were kind of the first things that the technology started proving out i would if you ask for milestone i would say that this was one of the milestones and i think a leading service providers like turkcell like deutsche telekom acknowledged that companies like ooma as well acknowledged that and that took them to the next level to actually make a bold decision and not go with the selection that everyone else was going with and actually put the bet on this technology and i think that theyre seeing very good result for that i would say that the next milestone after that was really the utilization of voice over ule and the fact that you can actually create a voiceenabled sensors and voiceenabled sensors are not just tell people to do communication and not just for people to activate and control devices or computers they are also to listen to whats happening in the home and actually be contextaware and be able to identify all kinds of noises from a door thats being opened the steps or the number of people that are entering a premise and you know like a dog barking gunshots a car that is driving into the garage et cetera et cetera so its like really an  the amount of use cases that can be supported are endless and i think one of our key customers was kind of the first to pick that up and this was securitas direct and verisure that they have launched a dect for the security market and i think this is kind of another milestone which is now also being converted into a lot of a voiceenabled devices at home that are  could be smart speakers could be kind of embedded in every device to do listening to enable through a voice communication et cetera et cetera so i think all of that is kind of acting as kind of the second milestone i would say the third milestone is really to marry that with artificial intelligence and this is part of the examples that we gave today i think emza was one of them and the other one was the partnership with liberty wireless matt robinson now with regards to the mobile versus other category ofer elyakim yes sure so first of all youre right so we are kind of mixing mobile and hdclear it means the same so in this segment where we sell the dbm chipset and the hdclear suite of algorithms and all of that we call hdclear this is kind of where we are making the designs and the engagement et cetera so in a way its confusing but it is interchangeable so they mean the same exact thing now with respect to the design wins or design in today we have a number of like prospect designins for mobile handsets so more than one of course as this is a fairly competitive unpredictive market et cetera we will not choose or elect to choose the word design win up until its in production up until we see the co but there are a number of these type of designs in progress so we call it either prospect or design in and we hope that this will translate into production and volume already into  and also improve and grow into  operator operator instructions we will now take our next question from charlie anderson from dougherty  co charlie anderson thank you for taking my question we got a lot of good questions asked already so ill just sneak in a quick one which is ofer you had mentioned some renewed interest in ule i wondered if you would characterize that as primarily european still or we seeing any in the us at this point ofer elyakim hi charlie so i would say most of the interest today is in europe and we have seen three european service providers basically utilize this technology for smart home and i think that were going to see a few more in the next  months but gradually and in parallel the technology has been noted in these type of selections and fact that the ecosystem today also offers ule this has been noticed by the  by also the north american side ooma as in itsp an internet telephony service provider which is gradually also moving into smart home services has launched a solution based on ule in the north american market but if youre talking about kind of more of the  a established telco service providers in the us or security vendors i think that this is in progress so of course there is interest of course there are  theres an engagement but i would say were still not at the level where there is going to be a launch in the near term but i would say that we have some very good and nice engagement that i hope that within kind of  to  months could materialize into launches end of qa operator there are no further questions in the queue i would like to turn the call back for any additional or closing remarks daniel amir yes thank you for
