traded on national stock exchanges the advantages of etfs—low cost diversification transparency liquidityprice efficiency and tax efficiency—allow us to manage the portfolio’s risk and equity exposure with rigorous precision transparency each etf’s “basket” of underlying securities is transparent and is published every day an etf either replicates its target index entirely or it invests in a representative sample of the stocks in the underlying index with etfs you know what you own on a realtime basis low cost most etf investors pay low management and administrative fees that are lower than those of most actively managed mutual funds according to morningstar the average expense ratio for equity mutual funds both domestic and international is  while the average expense ratio for all exchange traded funds is  this cost difference can have a significant impact on investor returns over the long term pricing efficiency and liquidity like stocks etfs trade throughout the day and their prices fluctuate accordingly the pricing of an etf closely tracks the price changes in its underlying securities for most etfs there is a highly liquid market making it possible for investment managers to execute buy or sell orders as soon as market conditions change the pricing of an etf is efficient because etfs offer shares through a creation and redemption process in other words the number of outstanding shares may be increased or decreased daily as necessary to reflect demand this is known as an “inkind” exchange diversification with precision using etfs shareholders can invest in asset classes or sectors of the market with pinpoint precision etfs allow for the creation of fully diversified portfolios in which equity exposure and risk are easily measured and managed tax efficiency due to passive management low turnover and the unique “in kind” redemption process of etfs capital gains tax exposure is minimized when redeemed etf shares are simply sold on the open market and the tax liability is usually based on the seller’s original purchase price for the etf the ability to buy and sell on the open market avoids the problem that mutual fund shareholders experience when fellow shareholders redeem shares from a fund in order to redeem those shares the mutual fund may have to sell some of the securities it holds and realize a capital gain which is allocated to all shareholders in addition mutual funds are required to pay out all dividends and capital gains annually so even if the portfolio has lost value that is unrealized there is still a tax liability on the capital gains that does have to be realized generally outperform most activelymanaged mutual funds in any given year only about onethird of activelymanaged equity mutual funds match the performance of their benchmark indexes over time it is extremely difficult for active managers to produce alpha consistently add the higher fees for active management to the equation and the longterm performance results look even worse because etfs are designed to simply track the performance of wellestablished indexes investors are not subject to the risk of the “negative alpha” produced by most active managers legal notices      terms of use      business continuity plan      privacy policy adv a      adv b copyright  smart portfolios™ llc  smart portfolios  register home      press
