and significant contributors while recognizing that there are many other contenders some of these “significant others” are included but to a less detailed extent than the top  companies introduction today healthcare is one of the top economic and social problems across the globe put simply the problem comes down to two factors accessibility and affordability here in america it is reported that us citizens spend twice as much as citizens of other developed countries however citizens in the us also report lower quality efficiency and access of service than citizens in those same developed countries globally there is an increasing aging population plagued with chronic disease these factors combined with a focus on prevention and advancements in technologies pharmaceuticals and treatments will undoubtedly cause demand for healthcare services to continue to increase into the future reasons for the study there has been a global focus on the use of telemedicine as a tool to cut down healthcare costs and bring about mammoth savings implementation of the new us healthcare law will if anything intensify this focus by increasing the number of people who have health insurance and are seeking medical services in the near to midterm telemedicine technologies offer one of the few ways of enabling healthcare personnel to meet the increased demand without unacceptable delays or other forms of de facto rationing there is interest in studying the ways in which collaborative healthcare can be better and more economically implemented through telemedicine recently announced best practices to cut down global healthcare costs including outsourced medical services homebased treatment intervention as opposed to post treatment integrated information technology it environments
