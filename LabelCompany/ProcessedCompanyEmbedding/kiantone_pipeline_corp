lengthy discussions among kiantone the assigned department staff the village of gowanda and the nature conservancy have resulted in a project which totally avoids any impacts on a unique natural area

discussions with representatives of the state department of agriculture and markets the new york farm bureau and the erie county and cattaraugus county soil and water conservation districts have resulted in agreements which will mitigate the impacts of pipeline construction on agricultural lands at the same time and most importantly several special conditions incorporated into the draft permit for this project are designed to avoid andor mitigate to the extent practicable any adverse environmental impacts of the project on the point peter brook watershed which serves as the sole source of water supply for the village of gowanda new york the routing of the new pipeline will largely avoid the watershed and additional pipeline safety measures will be installed in the existing pipeline which traverses the watershed i note this project is economically important to western new york the project will also have a positive impact on traffic safety and highway congestion by eliminating approximately  truck trips per day from the united refining company refinery in warren pennsylvania to uniteds western new york distribution and sales points in the buffalo area additionally the northern terminus of the pipeline is at the former ashland oil inc petroleum storage and distribution facility in the town of tonawanda which has recently been acquired by united refining company as an adjunct to this project and in concert with the town of tonawanda waterfront revitalization plan united will remove abandoned and deteriorating facilities to improve the aesthetic appearance of the waterfront area along the niagara river in view of the foregoing and upon careful consideration of the record compiled in this matter this decision is effective upon service to the parties whereupon the assigned department staff are directed to prepare a final environmental impact statement and the required findings statement in accordance with  nycrr  and  and to

attorney  west main street po box  gowanda new york   pursuant to  nycrr a the applicant and the assigned department staff were automatically parties to the proceeding the village of gowanda applied for full party status in this matter issues conference an issues conference to consider requests for party status and potential issues for adjudication was held in hamburg new york on march   as a result of discussions among the various participants at the issues conference most of the issues which had originally been raised for potential adjudication were resolved the only issues which remained to possibly require adjudication concerned the potential impacts of the proposed routing of the new  crude oil pipeline within the rightofway of and adjacent to the existing  pipeline through the point peter brook watershed which serves as the sole source of public water supply for the village of gowanda there remained disputed issues of fact regarding the alternatives considered by the applicant and the mitigating measures which are necessary to protect the village of gowanda water source upon hearing oral arguments regarding the potential issues in an order dated march   i established a timetable for detailed written submissions from the above participants to address the proposed issue of pipeline routing following the initial submissions of the prospective parties the village subsequently requested an extension of time for the submission of additional comments i granted the villages request for an extension of time to make its submittal the village submitted comments on march   followed by submissions from the applicant and the department staff on april  and   respectively supplementary comments were submitted by the village on april   and by the applicant and department staff on may   on june   i received a letter from mr musacchio advising that effective may   he had been appointed as village attorney for the village of gowanda mr musacchio sought a  day adjournment of any proceedings in this matter to prepare the villages case on june   i received another letter from mr musacchio supplementing his original request for an adjournment also on june   i issued my rulings which identified an issue which might possibly require adjudication in future hearings ie  how to best avoid or mitigate the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on the point peter brook watershed i noted that any hearing held would be limited in scope to issues which fall into three topical headings the areas of concern and the issues to be examined were as follows leak detection and spill prevention the integrity of the existing pipeline including the results of a magnetic flux pig internal inspection the potential for internal corrosion from refined products and the risks associated with a leak or spill of refined products vs crude oil the potential for damage to the existing pipeline due to any construction activities for the new pipeline the available leak detection technologies including capabilities for identifying small leaks which could be applicable for this project the benefits andor disadvantages of a double containment piping system within the watershed both for the new pipeline and potentially for replacement of the existing pipeline alternative routing the potential impacts both on the pipeline and to the surrounding environment of alternative routes for the pipeline particularly routes on the east side of point peter brook road either along the road rightofway or farther to the east which could involve the deer lick nature sanctuary and also to include the potential for relocating the existing pipeline to an alternative location response and remediation the terrain soils accessibility and other environmental factors along the route of the existing pipeline rightofway within the watershed which would assist or impede the response to and cleanup of a petroleum leak or spill the design location and capabilities of the applicants proposed underflow weir system for control diversion and skimming of hydrocarbons in the watershed and the various contingencies which the applicant would employ to provide an emergency supply of potable water for the village of gowanda in the event of contamination of the watershed including but not limited to potential use of air stripping and carbon adsorption equipment time to set up and time necessary to treat polluted water to achieve nysdoh drinking water standards and potential for developing or connecting to an alternate source of supply i directed the applicant to provide to the service list all pertinent information not already available in its application papers and the deis relating to the above listed issues i also directed the applicant to provide to the service list a list of the witnesses with curriculum vitaes whom it proposes for each of the above listed issues along with an outline of each witnesss direct testimony i noted that upon receipt of the information i would establish a timetable for the other parties to submit their respective witness information and further i would set the schedule for the hearing as part of its study of alternatives to its preferred routing of the new pipeline parallel to the existing pipeline the applicant examined the proposal to reroute the pipeline construction to the east of point peter brook road any construction which extended beyond the boundaries of the town of persia road rightofway would cause the pipeline to traverse lands of the deer lick nature sanctuary owned and operated by the nature conservancy this  acre site has been designated as a national natural landmark by the us department of the interior national park service on the basis of the sites geological and ecological significance the nature conservancy opposed any alternative pipeline route which would involve crossing the sanctuary lands because of this opposition the applicant initially abandoned a route which would create a disturbance corridor through the nature preserve however in the event this route was now advanced as a potentially viable alternative the nature conservancy requested it be granted party status in conjunction with these rulings i granted full party status to the village of gowanda additionally i granted limited party status to the nature conservancy for an explanation of the impacts of pipeline construction operation and maintenance on its deer lick nature sanctuary which would be anticipated in the event the point peter brook road alternative became a preferred route for the kpc pipeline i set the date for any appeals of my rulings as june   with any responses to such appeals due by july   on july   i received a june   letter from the applicant confirming its june   telephone call to me and requesting an extension of the appeal deadline for one month in order to pursue opportunities for settlement with the parties regarding the disputed issues of fact related to the above noted topics of concern also on july   i granted the applicants request and encouraged resolution of the potential issues by negotiation if possible on july   i received a letter from the applicant noting that several negotiation sessions with the parties had been held and seeking an openended time frame to continue discussions to resolve the potential issues on august   i extended the appeal deadline without date to allow continuation of the settlement discussions throughout the late summer and early fall i received various correspondence from the parties indicating that apparent progress was being made to settle this matter outside the hearing forum on november   i received a letter from the applicant indicating that agreement on an alternative route for the new pipeline had been reached by the parties kpc represented in this letter that all objections by the village are withdrawn on november   however the department staff informed me of potential opposition to the proposed reroute by one of the landowners along the new route the plateau recreation area inc the staff also transmitted revised language for special conditions  and  in the draft permit on november   i received a letter from the plateau recreation area inc suggesting that the pipeline should be routed along the rightofway on the east side of point peter road on november   i received a letter from the applicant stating that the planned pipeline route avoided the plateau recreation area property and was in fact located within the point peter road rightofway the department staff on november   consented to the proposed reroute along the point peter road rightofway provided that allen springs brook either be crossed in the dry or by pumping the stream flow around the work area the staff suggested the matter could be remanded to it for the preparation of an feis findings statement and final permits on november   i received a copy of a letter from the nature conservancy acknowledging that the applicant had successfully rerouted the proposed pipeline to avoid intrusion into the deer lick preserve by this acknowledgment the nature conservancy implicitly ended its participation in the proceeding on december   i received formal notification from the village of gowanda that it had reached an agreement on the alternative routing of the applicants new pipeline to further remove the pipeline from the area of the villages point peter reservoir accordingly the village withdrew its requests for a hearing and for party status in the proceeding on january   the department staff wrote to me seeking expeditious treatment of the application and transmitting several new to the alj proposed changes to the draft special permit conditions which had been forwarded to the staff by the applicant following receipt of this letter from the staff by my letter to the parties i reminded the applicant on january   of its obligation to formally respond to the comments on the applications and deis which had been received in march  i particularly noted that several of the substantive comments regarding public water supply safety which had earlier been raised by the cattaraugus county and new york state health departments over the contingency measures for the existing pipeline had not been adequately addressed in any of the post issues conference materials which had been transmitted to me i also noted that the department staff would need to modify the draft permit in order to properly reflect the agreements among the parties i further noted that upon confirmation that all of the issues which had been previously raised were satisfactorily resolved i would immediately transmit my hearing report to the commissioner recommending the proceeding be remanded to the staff for preparation of the feis findings statement and issuance of the permits for the project in response to my january   letter i received a february   letter with various attachments from kpc on february   these materials provided the applicants written response to the substantive comments on the deis which had been received from governmental agencies and the public during the legislative hearing process in march  the applicants letter also addressed the concerns over public water supply safety in gowandas point peter brook watershed which had earlier been expressed by the cattaraugus county and new york state health departments on february   the department staff transmitted a final draft permit to the parties and requested clarification from the applicant regarding two items in the kpc february   letter the applicant responded on february   accepting the terms of the draft permit on march   i received from the department staff the draft permit and a letter requesting the matter be remanded to staff for final processing and permit issuance if i and subsequently the commissioner found all issues to be satisfactorily resolved on march   i returned the draft permit to the staff for correction of several typographical and grammatical errors the staff returned a final clean version of the draft permit to me on february   i have carefully reviewed the draft permit in accordance with the dec commissioners organization and delegation memorandum  effect of stipulations on decisionmaking in permit and enforcement hearings it is my determination that the draft permit as now conditioned satisfactorily resolves all potential issues regarding the construction and operation of the proposed project in particular the special conditions in the draft permit adequately address the potential for adverse environmental impacts occurring in the point peter brook watershed which serves as the village of gowanda public water supply therefore i am hereby forwarding the draft permit along with this summary report to the commissioner recommending adoption of the permit with its special conditions and approval of the project

state of new york  department of environmental conservation in the matter of the applications of kiantone pipeline corporation po box   bradley street warren pennsylvania  for permits to construct and operate pipelines for the transport of crude and refined petroleum products in cattaraugus and erie counties pursuant to the environmental conservation law ecl and title  of the official compilation of codes rules and regulations of the state of new york  nycrr rulings of the administrative law judge on party status and issues dec project no  project description kiantone pipeline corporation the applicant or kpc an affiliate of united refining company has applied to the new york state department of environmental conservation the department or dec through the departments region  offices in buffalo and olean for various dec permits in conjunction with its proposal to install  miles of new  inch diameter crude oil transport pipeline in new york state from its existing storage facility in west seneca erie county to the new yorkpennsylvania border in the town of south valley cattaraugus county the new pipeline would then continue  miles south to the united refinery in warren pennsylvania the new pipeline would be installed primarily within the rightofway for the applicants existing  inch pipeline and would be located adjacent to and parallel with the existing pipeline the existing  inch pipeline which currently transports crude oil in a southerly direction would be converted to carry finished petroleum products gasolines and fuel oils from the united refinery in warren pennsylvania in a northerly direction to the west seneca facility the route of the existing  inch and proposed  inch pipelines traverses from north to south the towns of west seneca orchard park hamburg boston eden north collins and collins in erie county and the towns of persia new albion leon conewango randolph and south valley in cattaraugus county the applicant also proposes to install  miles of new  inch pipeline to carry refined petroleum products from its west seneca storage facility to the former ashland oil inc petroleum storage and distribution terminal on river road in the town of tonawanda which has recently been purchased by united refining company the new  inch pipeline would be installed primarily within power line rightsofway which would be leased from niagara mohawk power corporation the route of the proposed  inch finished products pipeline traverses from south to north the towns of west seneca cheektowaga amherst and tonawanda in erie county the applicants proposals to construct and operate pipelines for the transport of crude and refined petroleum products in cattaraugus and erie counties are herein collectively referred to as the project the departments region  staff as lead agency identified the proposed project as a type i action which may have a significant effect on the environment pursuant to environmental conservation law ecl article  environmental quality review and title  of the official compilation of codes rules and regulations of the state of new york  nycrr part  state environmental quality review seqr the department staff issued a positive declaration on august   and required preparation of a draft environmental impact statement a deis was prepared by the applicant and was accepted by the departments region  staff on november   as being adequate for public review permits required  a stream disturbance permit is required for installing the pipeline across certain streams  a freshwater wetlands permit is required for installing the pipeline across regulated wetlands and their associated  foot wide adjacent areas  a temporary revocable permit is required for installing the pipeline across stateowned reforestation land  a water quality certification is required for filling activities associated with the installation of the pipeline through streams and wetlands the departments region  staff prepared draft permits for the project which were available for public review at the legislative hearings listed below a coastal consistency determination pursuant to title  of the official compilation of codes rules and regulations of the state of new york  nycrr part  must be included in the state environmental quality review findings statement since the project includes lands located within the town of tonawandas and horizon waterfront commissions local waterfront revitalization plan area the applicant may require additional approvals and permits from other federal state and local jurisdictions prior to commencing the project note that the above listed permits are only for the portion of the project located within new york state and do not include any approvals or permits required for the pennsylvania ortion of the project legislative public hearings a combined notice of public hearing acceptance of draft environmental impact statement deis and complete application was published in the buffalo news the tonawanda news the gowanda evening observer and the jamestown postjournal on february   in the departments environmental notice bulletin on february   and in the randolph register on february   on march  and   administrative law judge alj robert p oconnor conducted legislative public statement hearings respectively in gowanda cattaraugus county new york and west seneca erie county new york to receive comments on kiantones deis and applications for the necessary project permits in aggregate approximately  people other than representatives of the applicant and assigned department staff attended the two hearings seventeen persons presented statements for the record concerning the applicants proposals the record remained open until the close of business on march   for the receipt of additional written statements issues conference an issues conference to consider requests for party status and potential issues for adjudication was held in hamburg new york on march   as a result of discussions among the various participants at the issues conference most of the issues which had originally been raised for potential adjudication were resolved the only issues which might require adjudication concern the potential impacts of the proposed routing of the new  crude oil pipeline within the rightofway of and adjacent to the existing  pipeline through the point peter brook watershed which serves as the sole source of public water supply for the village of gowanda there remain disputed issues of fact regarding the alternatives considered by the applicant and the mitigating measures which are necessary to protect the village of gowanda water source at the issues conference the applicant was represented by marshall a staunton esq general counsel kiantone pipeline corporation and united refining company po box   bradley street warren pennsylvania  the department staff was represented by keith g silliman esq assistant counsel in the departments division of legal affairs room   wolf road albany new york  the village of gowanda was represented by charles j hart esq village attorney village of gowanda  east main street po box  gowanda new york  pursuant to  nycrr a the applicant and the assigned department staff are automatically parties to the proceeding the village of gowanda has applied for full party status in this matter upon hearing oral arguments regarding the potential issue in an order dated march   i established a timetable for detailed written submissions from the above participants to address the proposed issue of pipeline routing following the initial submissions of the prospective parties the village subsequently requested an extension of time for the submission of additional comments i granted the villages request for an extension of time to make its submittal the village submitted comments on march   followed by submissions from the applicant and the department staff on april  and   respectively supplementary comments were submitted by the village on april   and by the applicant and department staff on may   on june   i received a letter from bruce w musacchio esq  west main street po box  gowanda new york  telephone  advising that effective may   he had been appointed as village attorney for the village of gowanda mr musacchio sought a  day adjournment of any proceedings in this matter to prepare the villages case the issue proposed for adjudication as noted above the existing kpc pipeline currently carries canadian crude oil from the applicants storage facility in west seneca new york in a southerly direction to the united refining company refinery in warren pennsylvania refined petroleum products ie  gasoline kerosene fuel oils etc which are destined for uniteds new york state distribution and sales points in the buffalo area are currently transported from the warren refinery via approximately  truck trips per day since at this point the issues which have been proposed for adjudication relate only to potential impacts on the watershed all further discussion of the project in these rulings is limited to that portion of the project which lies in the town of persia cattaraugus county new york between cattaraugus creek on the north and the kpc broadway booster pumping station on the west side of broadway road approximately one mile south of skinner hollow road aka skinner road the project proposed by the applicant is actually two separate actions the first is the installation of a new pipeline in the ground adjacent to and parallel with the existing pipeline the new pipeline would have approximately half again the capacity of the existing pipeline the existing  pipeline carries approximately  million gallons of crude oil per day the new  pipeline would carry approximately  million gallons of crude oil per day the same material would be transported within the new line thus the characteristics of the material and the risks involved with its transport would be the same in the event of a pipeline accident or failure however the quantity of material which could potentially enter the environment would be significantly larger the second action proposed by the applicant is to clean the existing pipeline and convert it for northbound flow of refined petroleum products from the warren refinery to the buffalo area thereby eliminating the approximately  daily vehicular trips this action would involve a new use of a pipeline which has been in the ground for  years to carry new products with different risk factors the capacity would remain the same approximately  million gallons of product per day  the village of gowanda concerns there is no dispute that the route of the existing kpc pipeline traverses the point peter brook watershed for a distance of approximately  miles nor that the watershed is the sole source of supply of approximately  gallons per day of drinking water for the village of gowanda and its more than  inhabitants when the existing pipeline was constructed in  the village of gowanda did not use the point peter brook watershed as the source of its drinking water approximately ten years after the pipeline was constructed in the early s the wells upon which the village had been relying for water supply were found to contain elevated levels of barium surface water from the point peter brook watershed was then used to supplement the well water and dilute the barium content to a level acceptable to the state health department following unsuccessful efforts by the village to develop new groundwater sources of supply which would meet the health department drinking water standards the village although aware of the route of the existing pipeline decided its only feasible option was to develop the point peter brook watershed as its primary source of supply in recent years the village has expended approximately  million in improving and upgrading its water supply system using the watershed as its sole source of supply being a surface water source however puts the point peter brook watershed at considerably more risk from environmental contaminants than the villages previous well supplies the village has raised concerns regarding the potential impacts the project may have on its water supply excavation for installation of the new pipeline could disturb the existing pipeline sufficiently to cause leakage in the  year old pipe a small leak attributed to corrosion has already occurred in the existing pipeline within a few miles of the point peter brook watershed in  in the town of eden erie county local residents discovered a spill of approximately  gallons of crude oil this leak was not detected by kpc personnel or by the firms monitoring procedures while minimal environmental damage resulted from the eden leak a similar spill within the point peter brook watershed could seriously impact gowandas only source of drinking water secondly the village theorizes that the conversion of the existing pipeline to carry finished products which by their nature are less viscous and more volatile than crude oil will increase the risk to its water supply in the event of a leak and spill this risk will be further enhanced in the northeasterly portion of the watershed where the pipeline route crosses very permeable sand and gravel deposits the village contends that the remoteness of the pipeline route through its watershed combined with the rugged terrain would inhibit a timely response to a leak or spill incident even after being responded to these factors would prevent a complete and proper cleanup such that the villages water supply would suffer adverse impacts the village has further noted that kpc has unsuccessfully attempted on at least three occasions in the past two years to run an advanced internal inspection tool known as a corrosion detection pig using the best available magnetic flux leakage technology through the existing pipeline due to mechanical failure of the device early in each of the inspection runs the pig was returned to its manufacturer in germany for repair and modification another attempt to inspect the existing pipeline for corrosion is currently proposed for the summer of  but as yet no recent internal corrosion inspection has been completed on the pipeline to mitigate the potential impacts of the pipeline on the point peter brook watershed the village has proposed that kpc reroute the pipelines either to pass outside of the watershed or to provide a route within the watershed which would afford greater protection to the village water supply in the event of a spill or pipeline failure the village has suggested that a reroute to better protect the sole source of water supply for  plus persons is at least as well justified as the department staffs requirement that kpc reroute the pipeline to mitigate the impacts to waterfowl and water quality related to construction and potential spills in the conewango wetland freshwater wetland ra farther south in cattaraugus county the villages primary alternative route proposal for the pipelines is along the east side of point peter road noting that this reroute would not completely remove the pipelines from the watershed the village has suggested this route is analogous to the route change for the conewango wetland in that the alternative will not totally avoid the wetland but it will use the existing swamp road as a safety berm and potential containment area kpc deis  appendix o in the instance of the point peter brook watershed point peter road would provide the safety berm and potential containment area additionally this proposed alternative would allow kpc to utilize the existing stream crossing point on cattaraugus creek the village also proposed an alternative route along the east side of broadway road which would take the pipelines completely out of the watershed the broadway road route would pass through a residential area and would potentially require a new and much more difficult crossing of cattaraugus creek in its initial brief the village also suggested the danger to its water supply could be protected against by double casing of the pipeline while not mentioned in the alternatives proposed by the village in its reply brief this suggestion remains as a potential mitigation measure the village further suggested that the applicant should obtain approval of the new york state department of health for a system which would provide emergency treatment of the gowanda water supply in the event of a pipeline leak or spill within the point peter brook watershed a favorable health department determination would be necessary prior to implementing any emergency water treatment or providing any alternative water supplies for public consumption as an final option the village requested the applicant investigate and develop either new alternative groundwater sources of supply for the village or provide acceptable treatment for barium removal from the groundwater wells previously used by the village in either case approval of the supply by the state health department would be required prior to use as a public water supply  the applicants mitigation proposals the applicant understands the sensitivity of the watershed area and has discussed several proposals of its own which it believes are sufficient to mitigate any impacts of its pipeline construction and operation within the point peter brook watershed the applicant has examined the proposal to reroute the pipeline construction to the east of point peter brook road any construction which extends beyond the boundaries of the town of persia road rightofway would cause the pipeline to traverse lands of the deer lick nature sanctuary owned and operated by the nature conservancy this  acre site has been designated as a national natural landmark by the us department of the interior national park service on the basis of the sites geological and ecological significance the nature conservancy opposes any alternative pipeline route which would involve crossing the sanctuary lands because of this opposition the applicant abandoned a route which would create a disturbance corridor through the nature preserve in the event this route is now to be advanced as a potentially viable alternative the nature conservancy has requested it be granted party status the applicant also evaluated an alternative route which would parallel the east boundary of point peter brook road but which would remain within the road rightofway noting that this route would still be within the point peter brook watershed the applicant also was counseled by its consultants against using the road rightofway for reasons of safety and increased risk of damage to the pipe from third party excavations the leading cause of pipeline accidents the applicant further investigated the alternative which would take the pipeline route out of the watershed along broadway road however following its evaluation the applicant rejected this route because of the very difficult crossing of cattaraugus creek which would be required unless the pipeline again entered the watershed to join with the existing pipeline to cross the creek at its current location based on its evaluation of the above alternatives the applicant decided to pursue its current proposal ie  use of the existing pipeline rightofway through the point peter brook watershed with respect to its proposal the applicant has examined numerous alternatives related to leak protection leak detection clean up response and remediation and emergency water treatment and supply the applicant has committed to the use of the best available technology to prevent leaks and provide leak protection along the pipeline route kpc now uses a ground bed type induced current cathodic protection system with a coal tar enamel external coating on the existing pipe to protect against exterior corrosion which could result from galvanic action kpc conducts regular testing of its cathodic protection system and in areas where it finds anomalies in its test results sections of pipe are excavated checked for coating coverage and signs of corrosion and if necessary repaired kpc believes this type of cathodic protection and high quality exterior coating provides the best possible corrosion protection system available although the coating material for the new pipeline has not been finalized the applicant proposes to use a similar corrosion protection system but with an additional extra outer coating on the pipe within the watershed in its new construction kpc does not favor the villages suggestion that the pipeline if continued to be routed through the watershed should be double cased or employ double containment technology arguments against the use of a double containment piping system are that leak detection and repair of the carrier pipe are more difficult than with a single coated pipe system and that the double containment interferes with the cathodic protection system used to minimize corrosion of the carrier pipe kpc has stated it will also implement regular internal inspections of the pipeline although as noted above it has yet to successfully complete a recent inspection of the existing line with an advanced technology internal inspection pig while corrosion of the interior surface of high strength carbon steel pipelines is typically not a problem with the inherently noncorrosive crude oil which kpc receives through its pipeline refined products are corrosive and pose more of a threat to the integrity of the pipeline interior surface petroleum based corrosion inhibitors will be injected into uniteds refined products such as gasoline and fuel oil prior to their introduction into the transmission pipeline kpc has stated that no other measures are necessary to prevent internal corrosion in its pipeline the applicant has acknowledged that despite all the precautions which it can take in designing constructing and operating its pipeline leaks will occasionally occur the predominant methods of leak detection noted by the applicant are a reporting by neighbors or public b pipeline patrolling c volume analysis and d minimum pressure alarms since the area of the watershed which the pipeline traverses is remote and uninhabited kpc cannot rely on having any leaks reported by neighbors or the public kpc does conduct regular aerial surveillance of the pipeline but only on a weekly or biweekly basis conflicting frequency of flights on kpc deis pp  and  in areas where the pipeline is accessible kpc employees drive along various sections of the route almost daily however no information was presented regarding how frequently kpc employees traverse the inaccessible portions of the route within the watershed on its existing pipeline kpc does a daily balance of the metered volume of crude oil entering and leaving the system by identifying irregularities between inflow and outflow this method is useful for detecting large leaks but it does not provide for quick detection and its utility in identifying pinhole or small leaks may be limited a volume analysis would be conducted on the new pipeline and also would be continued when the existing line is converted for finished products the applicant is exploring the opportunity for tieing in the volume analysis procedures with its computer control system kpc also uses pressure monitors at its west seneca storage terminal and at its broadway road booster pumping station in conjunction the existing pipeline if a large leak were to occur the pressure in the pipeline would drop and the pressure monitors would activate alarms in the kpc control room in warren pa the control room is staffed at all times and the kpc staff can shut down the pipeline and dispatch response crews new technologies for leak detection have recently been developed but are not in widespread use these technologies are being evaluated by the office of pipeline safety u s department of transportation prior to proposing regulations the applicant acknowledged at the issues conference that it has not yet selected any one leak detection system for implementation on this project moreover the systems discussed above while perhaps well suited to detect major leaks are not designed to identify small leaks which over an extended period of time in a remote area such as the watershed could release undetected significant quantities of crude oil or refined products into the environment in the event of a leak or spill the applicant would depend on its local employees who are trained in emergency response to go to the pipeline and close block valves which would isolate the watershed area pipeline segment kpc estimates its employees could respond and close these block valves within a half hour of notification of an incident kpc anticipates the installation of new block valves to further isolate sections of the pipeline in the area of the watershed and also new check valves to ensure oneway flow of materials through the lines in this area the applicant contends that contrary to the villages assertion access to the pipeline is easily obtained over the pipeline rightofway and via a variety of roads or trails which provide access from point peter brook road the applicant also contends that in the event of a spill the hilly terrain would actually serve to contain the flow of petroleum products and restrict its migration thus making clean up operations easier kpc has designed an underflow weir system to allow the control diversion and skimming of any hydrocarbons which might enter the allen springs area or the point peter brook area of the watershed kpc contends this system will avoid or at least minimize any potential pollution of the villages water supply and will facilitate and shorten the time necessary for cleanup of any petroleum products with the villages concurrence kpc seeks to install this weir system at the same time it commences construction of the new proposed pipeline kpc has located spill response equipment and tools at the gowanda reservoir for use by its employees in addition the applicant has offered to train gowanda personnel in oil spill response procedures kpc would also implement a water characterization study within the point peter brook watershed this study would include quarterly collection and analysis of samples in march  the applicant proposed the development of a detailed contingency and emergency response plan including provisions for an emergency supply of potable water in the event of a pipeline leak or spill in the watershed the emergency supply would consist of potable water which kpc would truck to the village for two to three days immediately following a leak or spill incident or until a kpc contractor could provide and make operational the equipment necessary for emergency water treatment a potential contractor of kpc ohm corporation has indicated that equipment involving air stripping and carbon adsorption can be used to treat the water supply in the gowanda reservoir to meet new york state department of health drinking water standards until the spill is completely cleaned up and remediated emergency treatment would cease when the gowanda reservoir had recovered to its raw water quality prior to the spill other options for an emergency source of water supply for the village were mentioned by the applicant but were not thoroughly explored for lack of feasible interconnection with the village water supply system at the present time these options included the potential of connecting with an extension of the seneca nation of indians waterline project andor with an extension of the erie county water authority intercommunity system in sum the applicant believes it has adequately and appropriately addressed all potential contingencies and there are no issues which are substantive and significant enough to require adjudication  the department staffs draft permit it is the department staffs opinion that the applicant has adequately addressed the protection of the gowanda water supply system and that the routing of the pipeline as proposed is the most reasonable alternative with that premise in mind the staff prepared a draft permit with  special conditions of which conditions  through  specifically address the route of the pipeline through the point peter brook watershed the staffs conditions for permit issuance call for among other requirements a the applicant to conduct a preconstruction meeting with the village prior to construction in the watershed b the spill response equipment and weir system proposed by the applicant to be installed prior to construction activities in the watershed c the new block valve on the existing pipeline to be installed prior to construction in the watershed d preparation of the detailed contingency plan and water treatment system design prior to expiration of the permit e copies of all reports for the water characterization study and magnetic flux pig study to be provided to the village and f the applicant to provide written confirmation of completion of all its proposed design and construction mitigation measures to the staff last among the staffs conditions pertaining to the watershed is a requirement that prior to the expiration of the permit the applicant negotiate and execute a legally binding agreement with the village to establish kpcs obligations regarding implementation of its proposed integrated spill contingency plan for gowanda in the event such an agreement cannot be reached the applicant must provide documentation to the staff that it negotiated in good faith and failure to reach an agreement was not its fault the applicant does not oppose any of the conditions proposed by the staff in its draft permit in its postissues conference briefs the staff noted its concerns regarding the environmental impacts of the alternative routes suggested by the village and indicated the point peter brook road route would be preferable to the broadway road route but also noted that the nature conservancy should have the opportunity to comment on this alternative additionally the staff reaffirmed that the new york state department of health doh is responsible for regulating the treatment and quality of public water supplies and that the staff proposed permit condition regarding the applicants contingency plan and water treatment system see d above or condition no  in the draft permit for full text was intended to ensure the applicant submitted a specific plan and design for review and approval by the health department based upon the available information the staff believes the applicant has adequately addressed the impacts alternatives and mitigation measures related to the proposed project and there are no issues which warrant adjudication  concerns of the health agencies although no health agencies have specifically requested party status in the instant case letters in opposition to the proposed project were submitted by john t kociela pe director of environmental health services for the erie county department of health eric w wohlers pe director of environmental health for the cattaraugus county health department and daniel e serrell pe associate sanitary engineer bureau of public water supply protection state of new york department of health note the village of gowanda straddles cattaraugus creek and is situated in both erie and cattaraugus counties both mr wohlers and mr serrell have been proposed as expert witnesses to testify on behalf of the village of gowanda the cattaraugus county health department the county has identified what it considers increased risks to the watershed of not only adding a new pipeline along the kpc rightofway but also of introducing refined products which are less viscous and more volatile than crude oil to the watershed it also contends the potential for a leak increases with the age of the pipeline the county noted the unavailability of any internal inspection data for the existing pipeline due to failure of the pig testing to date the state health department specifically contests the applicants statements regarding the viability of emergency water treatment systems regarding the methodology proposed the time necessary to initiate treatment of the contaminated source and the time required to treat that source to reduce the maximum contaminant levels mcls of hydrocarbons to allowable drinking water standards doh personnel with expertise in the field of potable water supply treatment believe the applicants proposals in this regard are unrealistic and in the event of reservoir contamination by petroleum products the gowanda reservoir would be unusable for an extensive period of time furthermore they contend that a pipeline leak in the area of the watershed where the pipeline traverses approximately one mile of sandgravel soils would have potentially catastrophic consequences on the watershed doh personnel recommend the only acceptable alternative for the supply of potable water in the event of a spill within the point peter brook watershed is a alternative source of water supply which can provide approximately  gallons per day to the population served by the village of gowanda water system rulings on issues one of the purposes of the state environmental quality review act as set forth in ecl  is to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and enhance human and community resources   ecl  states it is the intent of the legislature that the protection and enhancement of the environment human and community resources shall be given appropriate weight with social and economic considerations in public policy social economic and environmental factors shall be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities the implementing regulations for seqr in  nycrr d further note accordingly it is the intention of this part that a suitable balance of social economic and environmental factors be incorporated into the planning and decisionmaking processes of state regional and local agencies it is not the intention of seqr that environmental factors be the sole consideration in decisionmaking pursuant to  nycrr c any involved agency contemplating a proposed action which has been the subject of an environmental impact statement cannot approve such action until the agency has made an explicit finding that consistent with social economic and other essential considerations from among the reasonable alternatives thereto the action will avoid or minimize to the maximum extent practicable the adverse environmental effects revealed in the environmental impact statement process additionally in accordance with  nycrr d the agency cannot disapprove the proposed action without preparing a written findings statement which has thoroughly considered the reasonable alternatives and then determined that adverse environmental impacts cannot be avoided or minimized to the maximum extent practicable in the instant case there are factual questions regarding several of the alternatives and operating procedures which have been proposed by the applicant as mitigation for its chosen route through the point peter brook watershed through its offers of proof combined with the submissions of the cattaraugus county health department and the state health department the village of gowanda has raised issues which warrant a further examination of alternatives and mitigating conditions necessary to protect the integrity of the only source of water supply for the village of gowanda the principal function of an adjudicatory hearing is to resolve disputed issues of fact as cited above seqr requires a thorough examination of the reasonable alternatives to a proposed action to ensure that any potential adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated to the maximum extent practicable therefore i am ordering an adjudicatory hearing be held in this matter to consider the issue of how to best avoid or mitigate the potential adverse impacts of the proposed project on the point peter brook watershed the hearing will be limited in scope to issues which fall into three topical headings these areas of concern and the issues to be examined are as follows leak detection and spill prevention the integrity of the existing pipeline including the results of a magnetic flux pig internal inspection the potential for internal corrosion from refined products and the risks associated with a leak or spill of refined products vs crude oil the potential for damage to the existing pipeline due to any construction activities for the new pipeline the available leak detection technologies including capabilities for identifying small leaks which could be applicable for this project the benefits andor disadvantages of a double containment piping system within the watershed both for the new pipeline and potentially for replacement of the existing pipeline alternative routing the potential impacts both on the pipeline and to the surrounding environment of alternative routes for the pipeline particularly routes on the east side of point peter brook road either along the road rightofway or farther to the east which could involve the deer lick nature sanctuary and also to include the potential for relocating the existing pipeline to an alternative location response and remediation the
