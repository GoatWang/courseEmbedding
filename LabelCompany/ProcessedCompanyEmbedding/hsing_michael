tables that are posted on our website i’d also like to remind you that today’s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the sec earlier today mps had a record first quarter with revenue of  million  lower than revenue generated in the fourth quarter of   higher than the comparable quarter in  mps continues to benefit from technological leadership and our diversified multimarket strategy looking at our revenue by market first quarter  industrial revenue of  million grew  over the same period of  fueled by product sales for applications in automotive power sources and smart meters industrial revenue as a percentage of total q  revenue grew to  in our computing and storage market revenue of  million increased  million or  yearoveryear reflecting strong sales growth for ssd storage cloud computing and highend notebooks computing and storage revenue represented  of mps’ first quarter  revenue revenue from consumer markets increased  over the first quarter of  to  million and represented  of our q revenue the yearoveryear revenue increase reflected solid improvements in high value consumer markets including home appliances and lighting tempered by lower sales for settop boxes first quarter  communication revenue of  million decreased  from the first quarter of  and represented  of our total first quarter revenue gaap gross margin was   basis points higher than the prior quarter of  and  basis points higher than the first quarter of  our gaap operating income was  million compared to  million reported in the fourth quarter of  and  million reported in the first quarter of  for the first quarter of  nongaap gross margin was   basis points higher than the prior quarter of  and  basis points higher than the first quarter from a year ago our nongaap operating income was  million compared to  million reported in the prior quarter and  million reported in the first quarter of  turning to automotive macro economic trends in the industry appear soft however our market penetration is in the very early stages and we believe our future growth will be largely driven by gaining market share accordingly we expect revenue for the next several years continue to grow at a rate significantly above market as mps’ footprint and automotive is relatively small by the market size and opportunities are tremendous growth trends in automotive electronic applications align well with mps technology as consumers demand higher connectivity and access to more intelligent content more importantly the proliferation of sensors and multicore processors for autonomous driving capabilities provide mps with increased available dollar content for each vehicle these trends will have a strong positive influence on our business prospects over the longterm in addition to continued momentum from automotive we expect to layer on new revenue streams in  and in the years ahead beginning in q  product ramps for mps’ superior digital power solutions will drive growth in applications for cloud computing gaming council and highend notebooks we expect our digital power solutions will be further adapted in  and  for use in field programmable applications networking and automotive let’s review our operating expenses our gaap operating expenses were  million in the first quarter compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  and  million in the first quarter of  our nongaap first quarter  operating expenses were  million up from the  million we spent in the fourth quarter and up from the  million reported in the first quarter of  on both a gaap and a nongaap basis first quarter litigation expenses were  compared with a  net credit in q  a portion of a q  ip settlement was recorded as income in that quarters litigation expenses and a similar adjustment was not repeated in the first quarter of this year the differences between nongaap operating expenses and gaap operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan total stock compensation including approximately  that was charged cost of goods sold for the first quarter of  was a  million compared with  million recorded in the fourth quarter of  switching to the bottom line first quarter  gaap net income was  million or  per fully diluted share compared with  per share in the fourth quarter of  and  per share in the first quarter of  q nongaap net income was  million or  per fully diluted share compared with  per share in the previous quarter of  and  per share in the first quarter of  fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of q  were  million which included a onetime increase of approximately  shares upon adoption of the new accounting standards for stock compensation now let’s look at the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and investments were  million at the end of the first quarter of  compared to  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  for the quarter mps generated operating cash flow of about  million compared with q  operating cash flow of  million first quarter  capital spending totaled  million accounts receivable ended the first quarter of  at  million or  days of sales outstanding which was slightly higher than the  million or  days reported at the end of the first quarter of  this modest increase was due to a higher proportion of the quarter sales being recorded in the third month of q compared with the prior quarter day sales outstanding for the first quarter of  were four days higher than the  days posted in the first quarter of  our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of  were  million up from the  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  days in inventory increased to  days at the end of q  from  days at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  days at the end of the first quarter of  i would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of  we are forecasting q revenue in the range of  million to  million we also expect the following gaap gross margin in the range of  to  nongaap gross margin in the range of  to  total stockbased compensation expense of  million to  million including approximately  that would be charged to cost of goods sold litigation expenses ranging between  to  gaap rd and sga expenses between  million and  million nongaap rd and sga expenses to be in the range of  million to  million this estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses other income is expected to be in the range from  to  before foreign exchange gains or losses fully diluted shares to be in the range of  million to  million shares before share buyback in conclusion we continue to grow and continue to enhance shareholder value i will now open the phone lines for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question comes from the line of quinn bolton of needham your line is open quinn bolton hey guys congratulations on the nice result so i just wanted to start up with some of the revenue drivers for  it just sounds like the transition share gains on game console related devices and then server power management are kind of the three nearterm next  months drivers and just in terms of the timing kind of it feels like probably notebooks first game consoles maybe starts to ramp late here in q and then servers closer to yearend and just wanted to see if that’s kind of the right timing from your perspective in terms of the ramp of those three opportunities bernie blegen hi quinn thank you very much i think that the way that you’ve sequenced those opportunities is correct and let me just add a little bit of color so the notebook opportunities we expect to be sort of steady and consistent growth it’s not as if there’s a big bang that’s going to occur in one quarter and then grow from there when we look at gaming obviously that’s driven around the holiday season so we would expect that with the adoption of the gaming console business that that should be weighted more heavily into q although it may have a tail into q as well and then certainly with the servers as we’ve discussed in the past much of that while we’ve continued to see good revenue growth much of the next layer of growth we believe is expected with the grantley the purley transition which is expected to the second half and there again we see good games to come for as we are designed into new platforms and also we branched out into dual oems and that would include both our pol and our efuse products and then we believe over time that we’ll see adoption rates for our vcore power management solution that we called qs mod as that goes from that tier to tier and in particularly the cloud providers quinn bolton and on these cloud providers they tend to be sort of earlier adaptors in the sort of server upgrade cycle did that that kind of ramp do you think maybe enters the tailwind of  i know intel often provides early access to some of those hyperscale guys or do you think that’s still kind of more closer to year end and in to early  for that hyperscale cloud opportunity bernie blegen i think that when we look at the mps is overall energy efficiency solutions they really do bases for growth in the cloud based data centers and yes they do have earlier adoption rates michael hsing quinn this is michael all these are the company’s strategies we don’t really care which market segment how we time it and how we time it and that relates to growing our mps revenues so these – we actually in opposite we don’t want to – we want to disassociated with or we are tied to xbox or we are tied to whatever the game – whatever the game console in game platforms and in the game – in the intel’s of when we were to release – release productions for whatever the process so yes these are just our opportunity and that we only want to getting show our gross margin in the steady growth and our customers facing – whatever the – whichever the product is i can – we don’t contact and it’s all within a plus minus six seven months as i said earlier quinn bolton okay great and then just… bernie blegen i’m sorry just a finishing thought on michael there one of the interesting characteristics as michael has just laid it out as well is that it provides for a steady growth ramp both for the second half of  as well as throughout  quinn bolton great and then just the follow up question about jv you’ve talked about sort of some general macro economic weakness in the automotive sector but share gains would allow you sort of over the next several years to grow faster than the market and i’m just kind of wondering do you think that there’s any point in time where macroeconomic conditions can change the nearterm outlook i mean does macro change so quickly that it can fetch your quartertoquarter revenue ramp on automotive or do you think the share gains are really the driving factor there and even with soft macro environment sort of steady share gains that you have for more consistent growth just trying to get your sense on whether or not we should be thinking automotive could be lumpy michael hsing for the automotive quinn in mps as you know we entered a market about four or five years ago and four or five years ago our revenue almost is zero and even two three years ago very teenytiny and it takes a long time to get the revenue and so design cycle is about three to four years and we our total ten in automotive is about  billion probably now is more than that and so what is our percentage is less than a percent so it’s a total greenfield for us to grow as i see it in the next few years all the design win activities happen in the last couple of years so it’s all designing unless they cancelled a car they canceled their entire cars and are now going to move to a production market and of course the very effective mps revenue but it’s highly unlikely they’ll not introduce a car any more so we yes that’s why we said lucky is we – and also at the same time we’re gaining share we’re gaining share we’re entering other applications and we’re winning other sockets so the overall for us it’s very optimistic quinn bolton great that’s great now samsung galaxy note automobiles coming into marketing anytime soon and thanks and congratulations michael hsing okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from rick schafer of oppenheimer your line is open rick schafer thanks and i’ll add my congratulations on another nice quarter maybe just a quick followup on indiscernible i’m just curious which your guys thoughts are and how you see that mix migration and what it looks like over the next  months to  months i mean are we going to – is it a relatively rapid crossover possibly like the first half of  or is it going to take a little while longer for that mix to shift michael hsing i don’t think it’s going to be are very sharp cross over so that will be a gradual a gradual change so our revenue as i said in the last few quarters so the second half this year we start to gradually see revenue coming bernie blegen and i think i would add to that a lot of the initial revenue will come from similar dollar content hence we have in the in the grantley cycle and that is based on the pol and the efuse opportunities and then we’ll continue to gradually layer in our next generation as far as power management the qs mod over the next the course of the next two years so i think that michael is summed it up nicely that we see it steady ramping in that for us rick schafer okay thanks bernie blegen again the opportunity for us in a car computing is well over  billion and we have a very few i don’t know what is the percentage – it’s less than the couple of percent rick schafer and maybe just a followon to that then i mean how do you guys feel like you’re positioned with arm servers for copower or point of load or efuse do you expect any revenue are you working on any projects along those lines in the next same kind timeframe next   months michael hsing of course we want to cover everything like if we entered the market okay without taking our technologies and we can be easily adapted into different platforms and so we are working on it all these other solutions of them and a lot of them where we have it now rick schafer okay and then maybe just on switching gears to ecommerce and the initiative there maybe could first i guess is the website live and is it up and running i know you talked about sort of march april timeframe for launch maybe if you could remind us or kind of frame out how big that opportunity is in terms of potential new customers and when we might start to see revenues from that effort bernie blegen yes i will open up by saying that ecommerce solution and the opportunity that is afforded through ask field programmability and we’ve been viewing that really the second half of  and  as far as when the revenue ramp begins so to answer your question specifically this quarter we did have a rollout of basically an upgrade over our all website and then we’re expecting in about another  to  months time that will go up at the first generation of the nextgen website which will have an ecommerce component rick schafer got it okay thanks guys michael hsing just an update okay its very i call it baby steps i mean it’s just we show – we have other components in all the interactive and the ecommerce question haven’t really kicking yet and i hope in the next few months the new website will be live rick schafer got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from ross seymore of deutsche bank your question please matt o’connor hey guys this is actually matt on ross’ behalf congrats on the results once again but i’m curious about two inmarkets in particular comms and storage and computing it looks like they – you’re just a tad bit softer than at least we expected was there anything beyond your prepared remarks that could explain the directionality of those two and it sounds like that you’re pretty optimistic about both of them in the second half but anything you could talk about one in the nearterm and anything over and beyond what was already answered from the previous caller concerning the longterm bernie blegen yes so let me address just focusing quarter – yearoveryear on the quarter’s performance so the computing – storage and computing revenue for that market went up  yearoveryear and a lot of it was driven by storage ssd in particular and if i could offer sort of a thought is that storage for us has been somewhat constrained because lack of availability of nand and we had a very good bump and we expect that to continue for the next several quarters as there have been certain of the larger suppliers that have been able to extend greater availability and so that’s removed a bottleneck for us and then as far as the server and the notebook notebook we are benefiting as we transition from skylake to kaby lake and that is going to increase the number of oems that we serve it actually increases it by building five or six and we expect that to ramp incrementally right now but have continued growth through the remainder of this year and well into next year and likewise i think we’ve already addressed the server which is going to be driven by the grantley proleague conversion on the comms market i think we sort of had a very consistent theme that we are very enthusiastic of the opportunity there we believe that the field programmable solutions for power management that we have are ideally suited particularly for high voltage opportunities in the wireless infrastructure but that is a longterm proposition and so quartertoquarter we expect the comms market to sort of increase or decrease by a margin of about  million until we really start to get some attraction in next generation products and new customers michael hsing yes as i’ve said we’re going to introduce some acquainted product and that killer product is out will be introduced and i expected to have a next couple years that we’re going to grow that business significantly matt o’connor okay great and on the opex front could you give any rough color on this second half outlook it sounds like again we talked about the growth drivers on ocm but just a rough idea of what opex should do in the second half of the year bernie blegen sure i think that we said in the last call that we expect to be within our financial model growing operating expenses in this year at a rate that is represents  to  the rate of revenue growth in q we actually came in middle low end of that point and i sort of say that we’re targeting plus or minus  percentage points of the midpoint of that for the full year matt o’connor okay thanks so much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg of stifel your question please tore svanberg yes thank you and congratulations on another consistent quarter my first question is for you michael on all the consolidation we’ve seen so far especially our power and management companies i’m just wondering if it seems that changed in the marketplace whether it’s pricing or capacity because it seems like your competitors are getting global got the recorder how so any thoughts on that would be helpful thanks michael hsing i think of the – we gained a lot of large but these are first here customers in the recent years i think of that attribute to i was there to first our technologies and that came – and secondly i came out i think that yes i do agree there is some effect and our customers need a multiple sources and the source of that kind of dried out and the some it kind of forced them to looking into another supplied and a combination we’re both i think we gain a lot of recognition in the last couple of years and particular these are very well established at first year customers in auto and a industrial side tore svanberg yes that’s helpful and on the high end note books other than the process or change is it anything about the power management architecture there that’s along you to gain some incremental share michael hsing i think of for the high end note books i get where we are – consider now we can provide a total solutions and for the power management and so obviously – and other peripheral we can gain some more shares but we don’t want to associate that to mps is a notebook company and we only address that those are small vary thing vary portable and long battery running times tore svanberg yes and then on the industrial side which obviously have the strongest growth the last  months any further thoughts on the distribution strategy there seems to be some mixed strategies out there some companies are relying less on distributors some are kind of stepping them up what do you stand as far as leveraging the distribution channel in the industrial market michael hsing yes we’re in the past indiscernible sales guys are really have a hard work as opining the pavements to get our customers attentions and all these distributors just frankly just ignore us and then now they’re run out of source they come to us too and so i think as where we’re going to futures in the next couple years there will huge benefit to mps tore svanberg yes very good just one last question for bernie bernie the inventory days were not but little bit sequentially i understand it tends to do that in the march quarter but anything else going on there basically just getting ready for a strong period in q q bernie blegen sorry that’s exactly i think that as you look at the market that the fab capacity is being mentioned as a concern for some people and i believe we’ve positioned ourselves very well to manage the growth that we expect to get in the second half of this year tore svanberg very good again congratulations for the consistency thank you bernie blegen thank you tore operator thank you at this time i like to turn the call back over to mr blegen for any closing remarks sir bernie blegen sure thank you i’d like to thank you all for joining us for this

propensity obesity and business climate to name a few  an investigation was conducted to assess whether stateranking indicators developed by forbes would be correlated with overall economic performance we find that labor and quality of life have relatively high correlation with per capita gross state product that business costs the economic climate and quality of life are well correlated with the unemployment rate and the negative impact of high business costs on the growth rate of civilian employment is relatively high the correlation coefficient between business costs and per capita gross state product has an unexpected sign growth prospects exhibit little correlation with state overall economic performance the relatively low correlation coefficient between overall ranking and per capita gross state product or the growth rate of civilian employment suggests that it is not a good predictor for state workforce productivity or employment growth keywords state rankings
