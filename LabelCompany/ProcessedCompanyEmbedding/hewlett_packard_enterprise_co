wrote that hps general counsel at the behest of chairwoman patricia dunn contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists in order to identify the source of an information leak in turn those security experts recruited private investigators who used a spying technique known as pretexting the pretexting involved investigators impersonating hp board members and nine journalists including reporters for cnet the new york times and the wall street journal in order to obtain their phone records the information leaked related to hps longterm strategy and was published as part of a cnet article in january  most hp employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted hardwareedit in november  hewlettpackard released a bios update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault furthermore the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers there have been several smallclaims lawsuits filed in several states as well as suits filed in other countries hewlettpackard also faced a classaction lawsuit in  over its i processor computers the complainants stated that their systems locked up within  minutes of powering on

oracle has announced it will appeal both the decision and damages takeover of autonomyedit see also autonomy corporation § hewlett packard in november  hp recorded a writedown of around  billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the uk based autonomy corporation plc hp accused autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover the former management team of autonomy flatly rejected the charge autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured big data and by  was the uks largest and most successful software business it maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach and controls described as a rod of iron which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest  of its sales force each quarter while compensating the best sales staff like rock stars at the time hp had fired its previous ceo for expenses irregularities a year before and appointed léo apotheker as ceo and president hp was seen as problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services apothekers strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector as part of this strategy autonomy was acquired by hp in october  hp paid  billion for  of the shares valuing autonomy at around  billion £ billion overall a premium of around  over market price the deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition hp and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by hps own cfo– within a year apotheker himself had been fired major culture clashes became apparent and hp had written off  billion of autonomys value hp claim this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since  of its financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements and that hp had overpaid for businesses previously the serious fraud office united kingdom and the us securities and exchange commission joined the fbi in investigating the potential anomalies hp incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades low three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by

wrote that hps general counsel at the behest of chairwoman patricia dunn contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists in order to identify the source of an information leak in turn those security experts recruited private investigators who used a spying technique known as pretexting the pretexting involved investigators impersonating hp board members and nine journalists including reporters for cnet the new york times and the wall street journal in order to obtain their phone records the information leaked related to hps longterm strategy and was published as part of a cnet article in january  most hp employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted hardwareedit in november  hewlettpackard released a bios update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault furthermore the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers there have been several smallclaims lawsuits filed in several states as well as suits filed in other countries hewlettpackard also faced a classaction lawsuit in  over its i processor computers the complainants stated that their systems locked up within  minutes of powering on

continue to produce software compatible with the itanium processor hp was awarded  billion in damages against oracle on june   hp argued oracles canceling support damaged hp itanium server brand oracle has announced it will appeal both the decision and damages takeover of autonomyedit see also autonomy corporation § hewlett packard in november  hp recorded a writedown of around  billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the uk based autonomy corporation plc hp accused autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover the former management team of autonomy flatly rejected the charge autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured big data and by  was the uks largest and most successful software business it maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach and controls described as a rod of iron which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest  of its sales force each quarter while compensating the best sales staff like rock stars at the time hp had fired its previous ceo for expenses irregularities a year before and appointed léo apotheker as ceo and president hp was seen as problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services apothekers strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector as part of this strategy autonomy was acquired by hp in october  hp paid  billion for  of the shares valuing autonomy at around  billion £ billion overall a premium of around  over market price the deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition hp and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by hps own cfo– within a year apotheker himself had been fired major culture clashes became apparent and hp had written off  billion of autonomys value hp claim this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since  of its financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements and that hp had overpaid for businesses previously the serious fraud office united kingdom and the us securities and exchange commission joined the fbi in investigating the potential anomalies hp incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades low three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by the uk and ireland financial reporting council on june   hp agreed to pay  million to investors who bought hp shares between august   and november   to settle the suite over autonomy purchase israeli

source of an information leak in turn those security experts recruited private investigators who used a spying technique known as pretexting the pretexting involved investigators impersonating hp board members and nine journalists including reporters for cnet the new york times and the wall street journal in order to obtain their phone records the information leaked related to hps longterm strategy and was published as part of a cnet article in january  most hp employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted hardwareedit in november  hewlettpackard released a bios update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault furthermore the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers there have been several smallclaims lawsuits filed in several states as well as suits filed in other countries hewlettpackard also faced a classaction lawsuit in  over its i processor computers the complainants stated that their systems locked up within  minutes of powering on consistently even after being replaced with newer i systems the lockups continued lawsuit against oracleedit on june   hp filed a lawsuit in california superior court in santa clara claiming that oracle corporation had breached an agreement to support the itanium microprocessor used in hps highend enterprise servers on june   hp sent a formal legal demand letter to oracle in an attempt to force the worlds no  software maker to reverse its decision to discontinue software development on intel itanium microprocessor and build its own servers hp won the lawsuit in  requiring oracle to continue to produce software compatible with the itanium processor hp was awarded  billion in damages against oracle on june   hp argued oracles canceling support damaged hp itanium server brand oracle has announced it will appeal both the decision and damages takeover of autonomyedit see also autonomy corporation § hewlett packard in november  hp recorded a writedown of around  billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the uk based autonomy corporation plc hp accused autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover the former management team of autonomy flatly rejected the charge autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured big data and by  was the uks largest and most successful software business it maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach and controls described as a rod of iron which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest  of its sales force each quarter while compensating the best sales staff like rock stars at the time hp had fired its previous ceo for expenses irregularities a year before and appointed léo apotheker as ceo and president hp was seen as problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services apothekers strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector as part of this strategy autonomy was acquired by hp in october  hp paid  billion for  of the shares valuing autonomy at around  billion £ billion overall a premium of around  over market price the deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition hp and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by hps own cfo– within a year apotheker himself had been fired major culture clashes became apparent and hp had written off  billion of autonomys value hp claim this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since  of its financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements and that hp had overpaid for businesses previously the serious fraud office united kingdom and the us securities and exchange commission joined the fbi in investigating the potential anomalies hp incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades low three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by the uk and ireland financial reporting council on june   hp agreed to pay  million to investors who bought hp shares between august   and november   to settle the suite over autonomy purchase israeli settlementsedit on october   richard falk the human rights council’s special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the palestinian territories occupied since  called for boycotting hp

this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence

brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by

run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing

of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers

financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements

hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was

board members and nine journalists including reporters for cnet the new york times and the wall street journal in order to obtain their phone records the information leaked related to hps longterm strategy and was published as part of a cnet article in january  most hp employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted hardwareedit in november  hewlettpackard released a bios update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault furthermore the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers there have been several smallclaims lawsuits filed in several states as well as suits

related to its acquisition a year earlier of the uk based autonomy corporation plc hp accused autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover the former management team of autonomy flatly rejected the charge autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured big data and by  was the uks largest and most successful software business it maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach and controls described as a rod of iron which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest  of its sales force each quarter while compensating the best sales staff like rock stars at the time hp had fired its previous ceo for expenses irregularities a year before and appointed léo apotheker as ceo and president hp was seen as problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services apothekers strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector as part of this strategy autonomy was acquired by hp in october  hp paid  billion for  of the shares valuing autonomy at around  billion £ billion overall a premium of around  over market price the deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition hp and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by hps own cfo– within a year apotheker himself had been fired major culture clashes became apparent and hp had written off  billion of autonomys value hp claim this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since  of its financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements and that hp had overpaid for businesses previously the serious fraud office united kingdom and the us securities and exchange commission joined the fbi in investigating the potential anomalies hp incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades low three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by

board members and nine journalists including reporters for cnet the new york times and the wall street journal in order to obtain their phone records the information leaked related to hps longterm strategy and was published as part of a cnet article in january  most hp employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted hardwareedit in november  hewlettpackard released a bios update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly whether the computer was on or off the reason was to prevent the overheating of defective nvidia graphics processing units gpus that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers including hewlettpackard dell and apple the defect concerned the new packaging material used by nvidia from  onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks – effectively severing the connection between the gpu and the motherboard leading to a blank screen in july  hp issued an extension to the initial oneyear warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models however this option was not extended to all models with the defective nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault furthermore the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture including the replacement motherboards offered by hp as a free repair since this point several websites have been documenting the issue most notably wwwhpliescom a forum dedicated to what they refer to as hewlettpackards multimillion dollar cover up of the issue and wwwnvidiadefectcom which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers there have been several smallclaims lawsuits filed in several states as well as suits

related to its acquisition a year earlier of the uk based autonomy corporation plc hp accused autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover the former management team of autonomy flatly rejected the charge autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured big data and by  was the uks largest and most successful software business it maintained an aggressively entrepreneurial marketing approach and controls described as a rod of iron which was said to include zero tolerance and firing the weakest  of its sales force each quarter while compensating the best sales staff like rock stars at the time hp had fired its previous ceo for expenses irregularities a year before and appointed léo apotheker as ceo and president hp was seen as problematic by the market with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services apothekers strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector as part of this strategy autonomy was acquired by hp in october  hp paid  billion for  of the shares valuing autonomy at around  billion £ billion overall a premium of around  over market price the deal was widely criticized as absurdly high a botched strategy shift and a chaotic attempt to rapidly reposition hp and enhance earnings and had been objected to even by hps own cfo– within a year apotheker himself had been fired major culture clashes became apparent and hp had written off  billion of autonomys value hp claim this resulted from accounting improprieties misrepresentations and disclosure failures by the previous management who in turn accuse hp of a textbook example of defensive stalling to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company noting public awareness since  of its financial reporting issues and that even hps cfo disagreed with the price paid– external observers generally state that only a small part of the writeoff appears to be due to accounting misstatements and that hp had overpaid for businesses previously the serious fraud office united kingdom and the us securities and exchange commission joined the fbi in investigating the potential anomalies hp incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades low three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against hp for the fall in value of hp shares in august  a united states district court judge threw out a proposed settlement which autonomys previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of hps own responsibility and knowledge by essentially engaging the plaintiffs attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to  million with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against hps management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous autonomy vendors and management in january  the sfo closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low the dispute is still being litigated in the us and is being investigated by
