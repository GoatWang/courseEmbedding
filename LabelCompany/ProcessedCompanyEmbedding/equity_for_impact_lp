courses site log in advisor insights log in newsletters brand equity share loading the player what is brand equity brand equity refers to a value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name when compared to a generic equivalent companies can create brand equity for their products by making them memorable easily recognizable and superior in quality and reliability mass marketing campaigns also help to create brand equity breaking down brand equity brand equity has three basic components consumer perception negative or positive effects and the resulting value first and foremost brand equity is built by consumer perception which includes both knowledge and experience with a brand and its products the perception that a consumer segment holds about a brand directly results in either positive or negative effects if the brand equity is positive the organization its products and its financials can benefit if the brand equity is negative the opposite is truefinally these effects can turn into either tangible or intangible value if the effect is positive tangible value is realized as increases in revenue or profits and intangible value is realized as marketing as awareness or goodwill if the effects are negative the tangible or intangible value is also negative for example if consumers are willing to pay more for a generic product than for a branded one the brand is said to have negative brand equity this might happen if a company has a major product recall or causes a widely publicized environmental disastergeneral example of brand equitya general example of a situation where brand equity is important is when a company wants to expand its product line if the brands equity is positive the company can increase the likelihood that customers might buy its new product by associating the new product with an existing successful brand for example if campbells releases a new soup the company is likely to keep it under the same brand name rather than inventing a new brand the positive associations customers already have with campbells make the new product more enticing than if the soup has an unfamiliar brand namespecific example of brand equitybrand equity is a major indicator of company strength and performance specifically in the public markets often times companies in the same industry or sector compete on brand equity for example an equitrend survey conducted on july   found that the home depot was the number one hardware company in terms of brand equity lowes companies inc came in second with the ace hardware corporation scoring below averagea large component of brand equity in the hardware environment is consumer perception of the strength of a companys ecommerce business the home depot is an industry leader in this category it was also found that in addition to ecommerce the home depot has the highest familiarity among consumers allowing it to further penetrate the industry and increase its brand equity trading

investopedia  february   —  am est share a brand equity refers to the value of a brand name if customers are willing to pay more for a product from a particular company than for a generic product that company has brand equity an example of brand equity is the clothing manufacturer lacoste a golf shirt festooned with the lacoste alligator typically retails for much higher than a similar shirt with no alligator many customers happily pay the premium because they associate lacoste with prestige and sophistication brand equity can also be negative if a brand has a huge product recall for example or is involved in a highly publicized environmental disaster such as the  bp oil spill some customers actively avoid that brand and the brand name becomes a liability rather than an asset brand equity impacts profit margins by affecting profit margin per customer sales volume and customer retention when customers attach a level of quality or prestige to a brand they perceive that brands products as being worth more than products made by competitors so they are willing to pay more in effect the market bears higher prices for brands that have high levels of brand equity the cost of manufacturing a golf shirt and bringing it to market is not higher at least to a significant degree for lacoste than it is for a less reputable brand however because its customers are willing to pay more it can charge a higher price for that shirt with the difference going to profit positive brand equity increases profit margin per customer because it allows a company to charge more for a product than competitors even though it was obtained at the same price brand equity has a direct effect on sales volume because consumers gravitate toward products with great reputations for example when apple releases a new product customers line up around the block to buy it even though it is usually priced higher than similar products from competitors one of the primary reasons why apples products sell in such large numbers is that the company has amassed a staggering amount of positive brand equity because a certain percentage of a companys costs to sell products are fixed higher sales volumes translate to greater profit margins customer retention is the third area in which brand equity affects profit margins returning to the apple example most of the companys customers do not own only one apple product they own several and they eagerly anticipate the next ones release apples customer base is fiercely loyal sometimes bordering on evangelical apple enjoys high customer retention another result of its brand equity retaining existing customers increases profit margins by lowering the amount a business has to spend on marketing to achieve the same sales volume it costs less to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one negative brand equity has the opposite effect on customer retention and as a result profit margins after the bp oil spill the company lost many customers its profits immediately dipped and bp had to pour millions of dollars into an exhaustive advertising campaign to restore its image related faqs what are some of the benefits of positive brand equity

doctoral candidate and dominique m hanssens is the bud knapp professor of marketing at the ucla anderson school of management abstract the customer equity ce concept has been successfully applied to relationship businesses such as banking insurance and telecommunications this paper takes the ce framework to productmarketing industries eg consumer durables by developing a model that can infer the impact of marketing mix efforts on ce each brand’s acquisition rates and retention rates two core elements of ce are measured by decomposing the source of product sales into two parts existing customers and prospects a vectorautoregressive var model is proposed to estimate the dynamic relationship between the marketing mix and ce the model is applied to the automobile industry as an empirical illustration by comparing the ce model to the conventional sales response model we find that the impact of the marketing mix on ce is different from its impact on sales while both discounting and advertising increase product sales this saleseffectiveness is not directly translated to the development of ce in the longrun brands differ in the impact of discounting on acquisition vs retention rates higher quality brands are more acquisitioneffective while lower quality brands are more retentioneffective only one brand increases its longterm acquisition rate by advertising and none of the brands increase longrun retention through advertising advertising’s shortterm impact on acquisition rate differs across brands while advertisements by smallshare and cheaper brands have a negative impact on acquisition rate largeshare and more expensive brands increase their acquisition rates by advertising efforts the managerial implications of the model are shown by simulating the changes induced by an incremental marketing investment in the number of customers profits and ultimately customer equity over time introduction customer equity ce has emerged as a new paradigm for guiding managers to build strong and profitable relationships between the customer and the firm the framework regards customers as a valuable asset that should be managed like any other financial assets blattberg and deighton  given its emphasis on a customercentered marketing strategy it is not surprising that the ce paradigm has been applied primarily to the relationshipmarketing domain examples include insurance jackson  newspapers keane and wang  magazines dwyer  cellular phones bolton  airline pilot memberships thomas  and interactive television entertainment services lemon white and winer  however in most industries managers make their marketing decisions based on productbased metrics such as sales and market share as noted by rust lemon and zeithaml  “business success is based on customer relationships however because customer equity is difficult to measure many companies continue to focus on metrics that capture productbased strategies rather than metrics that capture customerbased strategies” for example managers dealing with frequently purchased consumer goods fpcg or consumer durables have difficulty applying the ce paradigm to their marketing decisions since the metric is not easy to measure when only product performance data are readily available however we argue that ignoring cerelated metrics in the productmarketing domain may mislead managers in allocating marketing  since most studies define ce as a summation of customer lifetime values clv we include the studies on clv in the ce literature  resources since the productbased metrics typically fail to capture the longrun profitability impact on which the ce framework is based for example promotion campaigns that are known to be sales effective and therefore heavily utilized could erode the quality of the customer relationship over time in such a way that longterm profitability is declining jedidi mela and gupta  to make the distinction between relationship and product marketing clearer we categorize various business situations in terms of  the type of relationship between the customer and the firm and  the type of marketing efforts mainly used by the firm see figure  contractual relationship means there exists a finiteperiod eg one year contract between the customer and the firm for the usage of products or services the interpurchase time is predetermined based on the contract and thus the firm can explicitly observe customer retention or defection however if the relationship is noncontractual it is harder to measure the customer’s retentiondefection processes since virtually all customers have different interpurchase times and in general they do not announce their future purchase plans to the firm schmittlein morrison and colombo  schmittlein and peterson  the type of marketing efforts also varies advances in information technology have enabled managers to implement more individualized marketing programs such as catalogues emails and customized coupons inasfar as these marketing activities are aimed at addressable customers blattberg and deighton  it is relatively easy to examine their impact on cerelated metrics such as acquisition and retention rate in  note that one firm or industry could be categorized in multiple cells in figure  for instance a car company can use either email or mass advertising and can have either contractual lease or noncontractual purchase relationships with its customers  contrast when massmarketing efforts eg broadcast advertising are used their ce impact has to be inferred by statistical models this paper expands the scope of the ce paradigm from the relationshipmarketing rm domain ie upper lefthand quadrant in figure  to the productmarketing pm domain ie lower righthand quadrant in figure  insert figure  about here researchers in marketing have suggested several quantitative models to examine ce these studies include  measuring ce given a few critical elements eg berger and nasr   allocating marketing resources under the ce maximization eg blattberg and deighton  and  linking ce to other business metrics eg gupta and lehmann  however the literature has been surprisingly silent in investigating the impact of marketing efforts on ce which should be comprehensively examined before applying the ce paradigm to marketing decision making processes therefore it is necessary to build a model that can  infer the dynamics of ce when some or all critical variables are latent and  capture the impact of marketing efforts on ce these are the main objectives of the current study to achieve these tasks we first discuss the existing literature in ceclv research area and show why the current study is necessary to both managers especially in the pm domain and researchers we then develop an appropriate model to examine the dynamic relationship between marketing efforts and ce next we apply our model to the automobile industry as an empirical illustration based on the empirical result we then discuss managerial implications by simulating ce dynamics for two selected brands  conclusions limitations and a further research agenda will be discussed in the last section literature customer equity is generally defined as “the sum of the discounted lifetime values of all customers” eg blattberg getz and thomas  rust zeithaml and lemon  each element of the definition can be interpreted or measured in a somewhat different way berger and nasr  for instance “all” customers could include the firm’s current customers as well as expected future customers if the ce definition only includes current customers future acquisitions and interactions within the customer group are ignored ie ce is defined in a static way we will refer to this definition as static customer equity sce a frequently used sce metric is due to blattberg and deighton  they suggested a simple formula for sce under fixed acquisition rate a retention rate r acquisition cost a retention cost r contribution margin m and time discount rate δ rrsce am a a m rδ− − r−  this definition is particularly useful in segmenting and thus prioritizing customers in terms of their lifetime values eg hansotia and wang  by ignoring future acquisitions static ce may underestimate the value of customers therefore some researchers include not only the value of current customers but also that of expected future customers in their ce calculation eg gupta lehmann and stuart   in this approach which we call dynamic customer equity dce customers are regarded as renewable resources drezé and bonfrer  in what follows we will use the dynamic definition of customer equity thus equation  needs to be extended to allow for future customer acquisitions as well as interactions between acquisition and retention acquisition rate and retention rate among the elements of customer equity acquisition rate and retention rate are particularly important because they are market response variables and we must understand how they relate to marketing spending however acquisition and retention rates are difficult to obtain in a productmarketing environment since the metrics are constructed by investigating customerbased performance eg number of retained customers instead of productbased performance eg sales volume acquisition and retention rates have been modeled in different ways in the ce literature they have been assumed to be fixed eg berger and nasr  or time varying eg gupta lehmann and stuart  metrics some researchers treat them as exogenous from marketing actions eg wang and splegel  while others consider them as endogenous variables affected by the firm’s marketing effort eg blattberg and deighton  we propose to model acquisition and retention rates as timevarying endogenous variables since our goal is to investigate the dynamic relationship between the firm’s marketing actions and ce via acquisition and retention rates therefore acquisition and retention rates are alternative metrics that capture the firm’s market  hereafter we will use customer equity ce and dynamic customer equity dce interchangeably  performance in addition we will develop a method for measuring acquisition and retention rates in productmarketing scenarios in which managers typically observe only productbased transactions the impact of marketing mix on customer equity blattberg and deighton  measured the impact of marketing on ce by decision calculus assuming onetoone relationships between acquisitionretention spending and acquisitionretention rates respectively however their approach is subject to two important limitations first it does not recognize the dynamic effects of current spending on future acquisition and retention the economics and marketing literature eg heckman  seetharaman and chintagunta  show that customer purchase behavior is not zero order similarly marketing spending levels may depend on past decisions and market responsiveness dekimpe and hanssens  second their approach excludes factors other than marketing spending for example if increased customer satisfaction leads to higher retention acquisition rates may increase as well due to enhanced wordofmouth from satisfied customers thus ce develops over time not only through marketing investments but also by wordofmouth ignoring these forces will likely result in an underestimation of the impact of marketing on ce rust lemon and zeithaml   also investigated the impact of the firm’s marketing efforts on ce through three drivers value equity brand equity and relationship equity individuallevel markov switching matrices were estimated based on each customer’s utility function determined by these three drivers and the firm’s ce was calculated by summing up customer lifetime values inferred from the switching matrix  they calculated how various subdrivers eg advertising could affect ce via the three main drivers using customer survey data however their approach is based on stated responses or intention which may not correctly represent the customer’s actual behavior morrison  model development we propose to link productbased metrics such as sales volume and customerbased metrics such as retentionacquisition rate by a sales decomposition and thereby to enable managers in the pm domain to examine the dynamics of cerelated metrics once we acquire time series of these metrics the dynamic relationship between the marketing mix and ce will be investigated by an econometric timeseries model modeling acquisition rate and retention rate acquisition rate can be defined as “number of acquired prospects or equivalently new customers divided by number of prospects” and retention rate can be defined as “number of retained customers divided by number of existing customers” the difficulty in measuring acquisition rate and retention rate in the pm domain arises from two facts first since purchase frequencies differ across customers managers cannot use calendar time as a time unit for calculating these rates for instance if all customers purchase a firm’s products once a year then the retention rate can be easily calculated by observing their renewal rates however in most product categories customers and prospects have different interpurchase times second the denominators the number of prospects and customers are not easy to observe in many cases as productoriented companies  typically do not have accurate information about their total number of existing customers or prospects we propose using conditional acquisition and retention rates to make them tractable in the pm domain the acquisition rate for a focal brand at time t can be decomposed as nnnsales purchase purchasequantity incidence ap ap pro ap ap prottt ttttp pro p pro pro ptt ttt tap pro protttpro ap ptttnnn sqnann n sq nsqnsqn−−− ⋅  ⋅⋅⋅−  where n is the number of prospects s is sales and q is purchase quantity the superscript p stands for total prospects ap for acquired prospects and pro for prospects who purchase the product category at a particular point of time therefore given purchase quantity and purchase incidence ratio we can write the conditional acquisition rate acq at time t as aptttprotsaacqs∝  by the same logic the conditional retention rate ret at time t can be defined as rctttcustsrrets∝  where the superscript rc stands for retained customers and cus stands for customers who purchase the product category at a particular point of time  the conditional acquisition and retention rates can be measured by examining a simple markov switching matrix as shown in figure  see rust lemon and zeithaml  for a similar approach each brand sales   can be decomposed in two parts sales originating from retained customers   and from acquired prospects   likewise competitors’ total sales   are generated from two sources sales originating from the focal brand’s lost customers  s and from lost prospects   with these decomposed sales we can calculate the conditional acquisition rate and retention rate since osrcsapscslc lps  pro ap lpttcus rc lcttsssssstt in sum given purchase quantity and purchase incidence ratio the acquisition rate and retention rate can be inferred by investigating sales originating from prospects and existing customers therefore equations  and  are the central connections between customer equity and product marketing the longrun impact of marketing efforts on acquisition and retention we investigate the marketing mix effects on acquisition and retention rates by a vector autoregressive var model dekimpe and hanssens  for several reasons first the model can capture the longrun aspects of the relationship among these variables since the measurement of ce should consider future acquisitionretention processes the model should be able to separate shortterm and longterm effects moreover the var model is capable of dealing with evolving variables that do not have fixed means trends and variances second the var model can also capture possible  indirect effects among the variables for example acquisition rates may be affected not only by advertising but also by retention rates inasfar as existing customers generate word of mouth to future prospects impulse response function irf analysis quantifies such complex dynamic interactions among the variables in the var model third due to parsimonious estimation and intuitive metrics eg irf elasticity the var model is easily understood and adapted by managers little  ce model vs sales model the starting point for our ce model is the

own marketing effort we will compare the impact of the marketing mix on acquisition and retention ie the ce domain in model  with its impact on sales from model  in this way we can investigate to what extent the use of productfocus metrics agrees with or conflicts with the purpose of growing customer equity in the next section we apply the proposed model to an empirical dataset and illustrate how the marketing mix effects on ce may be measured via acquisition and retention rates empirical illustration the proposed model is applied to the automobile industry for several reasons first switching behavior is relatively easily observed in this industry since most customers trade in their used cars when purchasing a new vehicle thus researchers can observe the origin of each sales ie from customers vs from prospects based on this tradedin model information second unlike impulsebuying product categories an automobile purchase requires a high involvement of the customer so that the longrun dynamics of acquisition and retention become managerially more meaningful third since automobile manufacturers have both horizontal eg sedan vs suv and vertical eg compact vs luxury product assortments the ce framework is more relevant than in the case of the singleproduct firm which has limited opportunity for crossselling and upselling  data weekly transaction data from  to   weeks in the luxury passenger car product category including suvs are provided by the power information network pin the data are aggregated in terms of tradedin and currentlypurchased brands following pin’s definition of the luxury category results in twelve brands however we will discard three brands  jaguar land rover and saab  due to an insufficient number of transactions the remaining nine brands however cover  of the luxury category the focal market consists of  regional submarkets eg southern california representing over  percent of the us national market on the marketing side the dataset includes pricerelated variables such as vehicle price consumer rebates and annual percentage rate apr for financing these data are supplemented with monthly advertising expenditure data by brand provided by competitive media reporting cmr the expenditures include virtually all media types including magazines newspapers tv radio and outdoor advertisements implemented by both manufacturers and dealers we first calculate daily advertising expenditures for each manufacturer and then convert daily figures into a weekly data series finally product quality and customer satisfaction data are obtained from three annual studies conducted by jd power and associates the automotive performance execution and layout apeal study the initial quality study iqs and the vehicle dependability index vdi study we do not incorporate distribution data in this application because in  by brands we mean makelevel names such as lincoln or lexus the firmlevel names such as ford or toyota will be called manufacturers and product names within brands such as the lincoln ls or the lexus rx will be called models  we implicitly assume that for example advertising for both ford and lincoln will affect purchases of the lincoln brand  the mature us automobile market there were no meaningful changes in dealer networks for the luxury brands during the period under study some descriptive statistics of the variables in the study are presented in table  insert table  about here the timeseries data on acquisition and retention are constructed as follows we first decompose the number of transactions for each brand into two origins purchases by customers who traded in  the same brand and  a different manufacturer’s brand for instance lexus transactions can be separated into purchases originating from lexus or toyota owners and from others such as nissan or ford owners we then decompose total competitors’ sales for each brand into two similar origins for example total competitors’ sales of lexus are divided into sales originating from lexus or toyota customers and from others in sum we construct four sales figures for each brand labeled as  sales originating from retained customers  sales originating from acquired prospects  sales originating from lost customers and  sales originating from lost prospects figure  shows an example of this sales decomposition insert figure  about here  this manufacturerbased data construction enables us to derive ce implications at the firm level including retention and upselling as an illustration lincolntolincoln repeat purchases as well as fordtolincoln upsell purchases are beneficial to ford as a manufacturer  var model specification var model specification requires a test on the stationarity of each endogenous variable we use both the augmented dickey fuller adf test with a null of nonstationarity and the kwiatkowskiphilipsschmidtshin kpss test with a null of stationarity to verify the presence of unit roots in the data when both tests confirm the existence of a unit root we treat the variable as evolving the motivation for this conservative approach is that the conventional adf test can fail to reject the null of nonstationarity too often and therefore overestimates the existence of a unit root kwiatkowski et al  when more than one variable in a var system is found to be evolving we implement johanson’s cointegration test to capture a possible longrun equilibrium among the evolving variables based on the results of unitroot and cointegration tests var systems are specified with corresponding adjustments on the endogenous variables if a variable is found to be nonstationary firstdifferenced forms are used to prevent spurious regressions granger and newbold  if evolving variables are cointegrated errorcorrection terms are added to the var model to measure the system’s adjustment toward the longrun equilibrium dekimpe and hanssens  when all variables are nonstationary with cointegration the ce response model can be specified in matrix form as  ki   ∑t i ti t t t∆yc φ∆yψzλχ ε where   ooccttt t t tacq ret dis adv dis advty tacq  acquisition rate tret  retention rate otdis

is a fivevariable system in which sales volume st replaces acquisition rate acqt and retention rate rett an appropriate lag order k is selected by comparing akaike’s information criterion aic for each lag with a maximum of twelve the above var system is estimated for each brand which results in nine var systems each for the salesresponse and the customerequity response model brandspecific var models are widely used in  for a more detailed discussion of unitroot and cointegration tests see dekimpe and hanssens  or nijs et al   lütkepohl  showed that the schwarz criterion sc is superior in lag order recovery and forecast accuracy for low ordered  var models however in higherlag systems the aic may outperform the  marketing eg pauwels hanssens and siddarth  and offer a rich set of diagnostics while avoiding overparameterization endogenous variables following equation  and  we define the conditional acquisition rate a as the ratio of brand sales from acquired prospects to category sales from total prospects and the conditional retention rate r as the ratio of brand sales from retained customers to category sales from total existing customers we then transform the acquisition rate and retention rate with the logit operator since the variables are bounded between zero and one hence ln  lntttttacq retacq retacq ret−t−  a discounting index   variable is constructed as the price index variable in van heerde leeflang and wittink  we first calculate customers’ average monthly payment mon based on vehicle price pri rebate reb and apr apr as follows odis  tttttaprmon pri rebaprτ−⋅−  sc in forecast precision lütkepohl  we use the aic in this application because the data are weekly and marketing’s impact is known to extend for more than two weeks  where τ is the length of payment periods the ratio of “undiscounted” monthly payments with zero rebate and  apr to this “discounted” monthly payments is calculated therefore the lower the monthly payment the higher the discounting index variable we use each brand’s weekly advertising expenditure for the advertising  variable all monetary values are adjusted by the consumer price index cpi oadvwe use the heaviest discounting and advertising by competitors as measures of competitive discounting disc and competitive advertising advc  since there are nine focal brands we estimate nine ce models with six endogenous variables each and nine sales models with five endogenous variables each this specification provides parsimony in both estimation and interpretation though it lacks a detailed explanation of brandspecific competitive structure within the category which is beyond the scope of this paper exogenous variables several exogenous variables are included in the sales response and customer equity response var system first a deterministic trend t is added in the model to account for any systematic industry or national economic trends second seasonal dummy variables are included for periods with unusual transaction activity memorial day weekend labor day weekend and the last month of each quarter pauwels et al  third we include step dummy variables to account for the impact of newproduct introductions by npi following pin’s definition of “new product”  models eg the acura mdx launched during the observation period are included in the var system   apr is used as a proxy for the prime rate  fourth an index variable for product quality and customer satisfaction cs is included by taking the average of annual zscores from the apeal iqs and vdi studies impulse response functions the dynamic impact of one variable on another in the var system is analyzed by irfs we follow the generalized irf approach proposed by pesaran and shin  and introduced in marketing by dekimpe and hanssens  the statistical significance of the irfs is verified by standard errors obtained by a monte carlo simulation eg nijs et al  with  replications in order to make the results comparable we calculate irf elasticities as explained in appendix  all elasticity measures are based on the level form of the original variables for example the response elasticity of retention rate to an advertising shock means a percent change in retention rate to a percent change in advertising expenditure unlike nijs et al  we use arcelasticity instead of pointelasticity since both logit and logarithmic transformations are used in our var systems results unitroot test results as shown in table  the stationarity of each endogenous variable in the var system is verified by the adf test and confirmed by the kpss test eleven of sixty three variables  are found to be nonstationary showing some interesting patterns first the dynamics of product sales do not necessarily coincide with those of customer  the average zscore is used to avoid collinearity since these three scores have intercorrelations between  and   equity metrics for instance while audi’s sales volume is found to evolve the brand’s acquisition and retention rates revert to their longterm means ie stationary this result implies that audi’s observed sales increase does not translate to an increase in its longrun customer equity second retention rates are found to be stationary for all brands while some brands’ acquisition rates are evolutionary in other words in this particular category some brands manage to improve or worsen their efficiency of customer acquisition but none of the brands can change the efficiency of their retention efforts in the long run insert table  about here lastly we find only one case of cointegration among cadillac’s acquisition rate discounting and advertising both trace and maxeigenvalue tests reveal at most one cointegration relationship among the three variables the impact of discounting on customer equity we report the irf elasticities of sales acquisition rate and retention rate to the shock of the discounting index variable in  following the literature in timeseries analysis in marketing eg pauwels hanssens and siddarth  we show irfs with tstatistics greater than unity the table distinguishes between shortterm effects in the same week intermediate effects during the dustsettling weeks and longterm effects after  weeks following the definitions of dekimpe and hanssens  table   the coefficient of the trend variable in the unitroot test equation for audi is significant and positive  insert table  about here as expected from the extant literature eg tellis  discounting ie price promotion has a significant shortterm impact on sales volume in addition seven of nine brands have significant lagged effects and audi and mercedesbenz have longterm effects all brands’ discounting efforts either increase or maintain their sales volume however this positive sales response is not necessarily converted to an improvement in customer equity for instance even though audi has positive intermediate and longterm impacts of discounting on sales volume the responses of retention and acquisition rates are not significant similarly while lincoln has positive shortterm and intermediate effects the brand’s discounting activities only deteriorate its ce in the long run due to a negative longterm impact on acquisition rate the role of discounting efforts in the ce domain differs across brands some brands’ discounting is relatively effective in increasing acquisition rates while other brands are more retention effective for instance extra discounting by lexus increases only its acquisition rate whereas cadillac’s discounting increases only its retention rate while the brand’s acquisition rate is negatively affected by the marketing activity thus we may categorize auto brands in two groups acquisitioneffective and retentioneffective brands the former include all japanese brands acura infiniti and lexus and the latter include american brands cadillac and lincoln managers can use this  detailed unitroot and cointegration test results are available from the first author upon request  the number of lags varies across brands mean   range   to  weeks  information to diagnose the impact of their marketing efforts in more detail and to better allocate marketing resources to existing customers vs prospects we conjecture that these important differences in discounting effectiveness across brands are related to their levels of product quality and customer satisfaction figure  illustrates with simple regression analysis how that the difference between acquisitioneffectiveness and retentioneffectiveness is associated with both initial quality measured by iqs r   and reliability measured by vdi r   we observe that price discounting actions by brands that have relatively higher quality and customer satisfaction are more effective in acquiring new customers than in retaining existing customers and vice versa for brands that have relatively lower quality and customer satisfaction thus if customers are satisfied with a highquality product their repeat purchase decisions are less likely to be affected by their favorite brand’s marketing interventions such as price discounting instead such brands can use discounting more effectively to attract new customers so that the firm can successfully grow its market share in this mature product category this conclusion is corroborated by the observation that three japanese highsatisfaction brands increased their combined annual market share from  to  while two lowersatisfaction us brands decreased theirs from  to  during the threeyear observation period insert figure  about here on average across these nine brands we find that discounting rarely increases a brand’s customer equity in the long run only acura enjoys a longrun positive impact  of discounting on its acquisition rate and no brands can increase longrun retention rates by discounting moreover lincoln and cadillac’s discounting have negative longrun impacts on acquisition rate thus if a manager at lincoln or cadillac only examines the impact of discounting on sales volumes its negative influence on customer equity may go unnoticed in fact cadillac’s shortterm sales increase induced by discounting comes mainly from customer retention but in the long run this discounting has a negative effect on the efficiency of acquiring prospects this finding may also be interpreted as a negative longterm impact of price promotions on the health of brands blattberg briesch and fox  it is also consistent with a result from pauwels et al’s study  that rebates generally do not increase the firm’s shareholder value in the longrun the impact of advertising on customer equity table  shows the impact of advertising on sales volume and ce consistent with past literature eg sethuraman and tellis  advertising has much smaller effects on sales than discounting seven of nine brands do not show significant contemporaneous effects of advertising on sales and only acura and mercedesbenz increase their longterm sales by advertising however as in the case of discounting the impact of advertising on sales volume is not directly translated into the ce domain first positive impacts of advertising on sales do not always correspond to an increase in ce for instance even though bmw enjoys a positive shortterm sales effect of advertising the brand does not significantly increase its customer equity by this advertising similarly audi’s advertising does not significantly impact its sales and actually deteriorates this brand’s customer equity  the observed differences in sales vs ce effects of advertising may be explained as follows acquisition and retention rates are metrics that capture not only a “revealed” topline performance ie acquired prospects and retained customers but also “hidden” lost opportunities ie lost prospects and lost customers given the same level of sales volume acquisition and retention rates could increase or decrease depending on the underlying lost opportunities that are affected by other forces such as competitors’ marketing efforts and wordofmouth between existing customers and prospects for example if extra advertising induces strong competitive reactions over time a brand may face a decrease in customer equity due to tougher competition even though it maintains the same sales volume second consistent with deighton henderson and neslin’s findings  in fpcg categories advertising does not have any direct significant impact on retention rate in the shortrun in deighton et al’s terminology “usage dominance” plays a more important role in this market than “framing” effects between advertising and customer several years of experience with a luxury automobile makes the evidence of the product quality “unambiguous” hoch and ha  so that advertising can hardly affect customer’s judgment of the product while we find some significant intermediate effects of advertising on retention rate these impacts may be explained by competitive reactions performance feedback and wordofmouth effects decomposing these dynamic effects pauwels  is an interesting topic for future research third the shortterm and intermediate impact of advertising on acquisition rate supports the proposition that advertising provides valuable information to customers and thus increases competition among brands only mercedesbenz has a positive longterm  effect of advertising on acquisition rate but audi infiniti and volvo have only negative impacts other brands do not have any significant impacts interestingly among nine brands infiniti  market share and audi  market share are the smallest brands in terms of market share and infiniti volvo and audi are second third and fourth cheapest brands respectively in terms of average vehicle prices mercedesbenz  market share which has a positive longterm impact of advertising has the biggest market share and is the most expensive brand in the product category this result can be interpreted that for smaller brands direct persuasive effects are dominated by cross effects of competitive reactions by other brands bigger brands have advantages in advertising in the longrun kent and allen  nonsignificant advertising effects on acquisition for five of nine brands show that there exists little switching from competitive brands to the advertising brands raj  in fact in a recent study by banerjee and bandyopadhyay  the authors analytically showed that given a significant portion of customers who have latent inertia of repeat purchase advertising is not an effective competitive marketing tool for small firms who generally compete on the basis of price insert table  about here so far we have examined the dynamic impact of marketing on acquisition and retention rates using these results one can investigate how the firm’s marketing mix affects its dce which is a nontrivial combination of acquisition rate retention rate marketing costs contribution margins and time discount factors in the next section we numerically illustrate the impact of an extra marketing intervention on dce and other  managerially relevant metrics such as number of customers and profits we describe how dynamic customer equity unfolds over time for two different brands who initiate a discounting effort that has different dynamic effects on their acquisition and retention rates a numerical simulation of customer equity we first derive dce at time t as a function of conditional retention rate r conditional acquisition rate a and the current number of existing customers nt total number of customers in the product category nc retention cost per customer r acquisition cost per prospect a  category sales sc and time discount factor δ assumptions and derivations can be found in appendix  as a result ce evaluated at time t can be expressed as    titiicctccvdcenarrmam samansasnraδδδ∞− − −−∑c  where vt stands for the value of customers at time t note that this derivation is an extension of blattberg and deighton’s  sce formula it incorporates the dynamic aspects of customer equity as well as a modified analytical solution to gupta et al’s  discrete version of customer equity calculation we simulate how an unexpected marketing intervention such as a  extra discount affect the future stream of number of customers profits and customer equity for  two brands acura and lincoln we use each brand’s impulse response of acquisition rate retention rate and discounting to a discounting shock in order to calculate the total impact of this  extra discount note that acura enjoys a longterm positive impact of discounting on acquisition rate while lincoln has a negative impact moreover lincoln’s extra discount has a longer decision inertia  weeks than acura’s  weeks resulting in more supplemental spending in the future insert table  about here as shown in table  we first calculate the focal metrics under normal business conditions derived from the data and several assumptions explained in appendix  for instance using sample averages of vehicle price retention rate and acquisition rate we are able to calculate the status quo scenario under the assumptions on current number of customers total product category sales contribution margin and time discount factor using the same assumptions we then recalculate number of customers profit per period and customer equity with a  extra discount by using the irf elasticity estimated from the model by comparing these two scenarios ie status quo vs marketing intervention we investigate how the firm’s marketing mix affects cerelated metrics in this numerical illustration acura successfully develops its ce even in the status quo scenario mainly due to its high average retention rate  and acquisition rate  the brand also expands its customer pool and achieves higher perperiod profits over time implementing the extra marketing activity helps acura increase its ce  for ease of exposition we use the notation r and a for conditional retention and acquisition rate  beyond the status quo scenario a main driver of this increase is the longterm effect of discounting on acquisition rate an interesting difference exists between shortterm profit and customer equity in the same week when the extra discount is implemented acura’s profit is significantly reduced  of status quo profit but its customer equity increases  of status quo ce due to the expected customer value the marketing effort will generate in the future on the other hand lincoln fails to increase its ce by discounting efforts one year after the marketing intervention the brand only achieves  of its statusquo customer equity note that lincoln’s decrease in number of customers is small  decrease in one year compared to its reduction in ce the main reasons for the ce decline for lincoln are the inertia in the company’s decision process and the inefficiency of acquiring new customers that is while acura’s incremental marketing efforts quickly dissipate back to normal lincoln keeps spending at higher levels without achieving higher market response ie acquisition and retention rates moreover in the long run the brand’s acquisition rate is negatively affected by the extra marketing effort as a result the extra marketing intervention by lincoln while sales effective in the short run has a negative impact on the brand’s future ce development conclusion in this paper we show how product marketers can infer the impact of their marketing mix efforts on the dynamics of customer equity via retention rate and acquisition rate using a series of switching matrices we calculate four different sales respectively  figures for each brand viz sales originating from existing customers new customers lost customers and lost prospects we then construct the time series of two core elements of ce retention rate and acquisition rate the longrun impact of marketing mix efforts on ce is investigated by estimating var models and calculating impulse responses of retention rate and acquisition rate to the shock of corresponding marketing efforts the main contribution of this paper is to derive customerequity metrics from conventional productbased metrics such as sales and thus to derive the longterm customerrelationship consequences of various productmarketing actions the proposed model enables managers to assess the health of their brands by comparing the impact of marketing efforts on customer equity vs sales by comparing these impacts managers can reallocate their marketing resources to maximize the longterm value of the firm as an example in our empirical illustration even though lincoln’s discounting has a positive shortterm and intermediate impact on sales volume it has a negative longrun impact on customer equity and thus should be avoided as much as possible the main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows • in the product marketing environment acquisition rate and retention rate can be measured by decomposing sales into four parts sales from existing customers from new customers from lost customers and from lost prospects • the impact of the marketing mix on customer equity is different from its impact on sales in an empirical illustration for the automobile industry both discounting and advertising increase product sales but discounting does not increase customer equity in the longrun only one of nine brands increases its longterm acquisition rate by advertising  • brands differ in the source of their ce increase induced by discounting efforts higherquality brands are more acquisitioneffective and lowerquality brands are more retentioneffective • advertising does not have a significant impact on retention rate both contemporaneously and in the longrun • the impact of advertising on acquisition rate is different across brands advertising by smallshare and cheaper brands has a negative impact on their acquisition rate whereas advertising by largeshare and expensive brands increases their acquisition rates this paper has several limitations that offer opportunity for further research first there exist other endogenous drivers of customer equity assumed to be exogenous in this paper for example examining how marketing activities affect the future contribution margin for different customer cohorts is an interesting issue reinartz and kumar   second customer equity may be more sensitive to individualized marketing efforts such as direct mail than mass marketing efforts such as discounting and advertising if the firm uses different marketing strategies with existing customers vs prospects a model may be developed that captures retention and acquisition effectiveness separately for each third different product categories need to be studied while our model can be extended to fastmoving consumer products the sales decomposition for such categories is a challenging task because the ownershipbased grouping of existing vs new customers in this paper
