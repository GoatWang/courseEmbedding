river capital llc  private equity capital firm about north river capital is a private equity capital firm headquartered in fort wayne in north river is funded exclusively by its principals for the purpose of directly investing in the private equity space using the principals indepth working knowledge of operations and strategic growth north river seeks to grow its portfolio companies through a philosophy of investing in strong management and key capital growthproductivity while fostering a collaborative team approach to human resources north river’s investment objective is to seek manufacturing companies with a strong management team and an identifiable niche in its industry while north river is open to many industries its “sweet spot” is manufacturers that utilize metal in their product and sell primarily to industrial companies north river targets companies with ebitda in the range of  to  million with latitude on either side for a target that fits well with a current portfolio company  since north river only invests the funds of its principals the investment horizon and strategy deployed have significant flexibility north river prefers to invest in companies with a longterm hold strategy and an emphasis on strong organic growth while maintaining the option to grow through strategic acquisition since inception north river has sold only one portfolio company in the industrial space north river’s approach to its portfolio companies is based on the extensive operating experience of the principals all of the principals at north river boast from  to  years experience in operational management and executive positions across a broad range of industries including mining automotive service and most recently scrap processing as executives at omnisource corporation one of the largest scrap processors in the country the north river team’s most recent significant achievement was the growth and ultimate sale of omnisource to steel dynamics in  for over  billion prior to that sale omnisource corporation was a privately held company owned by the rifkin family from  to  from a family startup the company grew to almost  billion in revenue with  locations and over  employees the most significant growth occurred between  and  under the direction of north river’s principals that served as executives of the company during that time omnisource acquired or started over  companiesfacilities and grew revenue by over  and profits by over  this growth was directly related to the north river team’s philosophy of investing in strong management and key capital while using a collaborative team approach to human resources all of which was applied to achieve a clear strategic vision  north river believes that its competitive advantages in the private equity space are its longterm investment horizon and approach to human resources these advantages were born out of the approach used to grow omnisource to be a dominant force in the scrap industry while maintaining an employee friendly familyowned atmosphere this approach is perfectly suited for the seller who is keenly interested in perpetuating the culture and security of their employees while maximizing value in a sale process the north river team is noted for providing strategic guidance operational insights and a familyowned human resource style to its portfolio companies  click here to
