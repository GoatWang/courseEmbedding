essential to defending it tag you’re mapped a common use case for performing host discovery is to focus scans against certain operating systems this can be done a number of ways in qualysguard historically via maps or light scans followed by a manual workflow today qualysguard’s asset tagging can be leveraged to automate this very process by dynamically tagging hosts by their operating system one can split up scanning into the following frequent light scans that update qualysguard with the current mapping of your network via dynamic asset tags targeted complete scans against tags

scanning how to scan across an air gap with qualysguard posted by eric perraudeau in qualys technology on april   an air gap network sometimes called an isolated network is a set of systems that are intentionally isolated from the internet or other networks for increased security if there is an air gap ie no physical connection between your systems and unsecured networks or the internet then you have better protection against data leakage or intrusion air gap networks are most common in production or manufacturing environments such as nuclear power plants or where scadatype systems are installed in military or government organizations and in sensitive financial applications like stock exchanges despite the air gap these environments still can require security audits to ensure that other defenseindepth controls are in place and working properly for example it is believed that the wellknown stuxnet virus entered the systems via a usb stick showing how an air gap is not a

their vulnerability remediation process in addition dynamic asset tagging and management which automatically identifies categorizes and manages large numbers of assets in highly dynamic it environments is now integrated with vulnerability scorecard reports this integration gives security managers and executives always uptodate reports that measure the number of vulnerable hosts per business unit against a list of vulnerabilities that represent the most important security risks these reports also display the groups of assets or business units that are meeting their goals in term of fixing these vulnerabilities furthermore vulnerability scorecard reports provide additional vulnerability management metrics and statistics giving managers and unit managers more visibility into the efficiency of fixing critical and important vulnerabilities that expose their business to it risks the vulnerability scorecard reports offer these new capabilities customizable business risk goals represent the maximum allowed percentage of vulnerable hosts per asset tag or asset group support for vulnerability search lists search lists can be used as a set of vulnerabilities that must be fixed according to their security risk and the scorecards will measure the remediation progress and report the entities that have met their goal breakdown of vulnerabilities per asset tag and asset group organizes assets by business units technology or other organizational entities number of new active fixed and reopened vulnerabilities gives insight into vulnerability scanning and remediation performance number of vulnerabilities by age shows the number vulnerabilities that are less than one month two months or three months old number of vulnerabilities by type shows the breakdown of

product news scorecard vulnerability announcing was  with malware detection and burp suite integration posted by willb in qualys technology on february   in the last  years hackers have routinely taken advantage of web application vulnerabilities to successfully breach organizations during that time there has also been an increase in the use of malware hosted on websites to infect unsuspecting users many times a vulnerability in a website is exploited to setup the malware that a legitimate website may then deliver the relationship between website vulnerabilities and malware is one that is likely to continue to increase the verizon  data breach investigation report notes “out of the  incidents this year  leveraged hacking  included malware and an impressive  of all breaches featured a combination of hacking techniques and malware“  the combination of threats presents organizations with a new challenge when trying to identify both web application vulnerabilities and malware that may exist on their sites was  now includes malware detection in announcing qualysguard was  organizations now have away to address the need to detect not only web application vulnerabilities but also malware that may infect these same web properties  qualys has offered the malware detection service as both a freemium solution for individuals and as an enterprise edition for larger organizations that need to protect a large number of websites with was  qualys has integrated this malware detection capability into the was solution to make it easy for organizations to configure both types of scans from was although the services are integrated the way the scanning is executed and the threats that are identified by vulnerability scanning and malware detection are very different now that we’ve outlined the integration at a high level lets go into a little more detail about how each type of scanning is performed and how they are integrated in was  malware detection dashboard advanced detection methods qualysguard was works by interacting with a web application or website just as a user would but does so in a fully automated way the was scanner will request pages login and follow links to new pages posting forms as it goes while interacting with the site was injects hostile payloads and then observes how the web application responds if the web application responds in a given way was can determine that the application is vulnerable to the specific attack used this is the same type of action that a penetration tester or malicious hacker would use to discover these vulnerabilities but it is done in an automated way that takes a fraction of the time that it does for a human this makes the automated scanning far more cost effective the malware detection service mds takes a different approach to detection while mds also automatically interacts with the site as a user would navigating and following links it uses a much different technique to detect malware  mds primarily uses behavioral analysis to identify when a website is infected with malware mds actually interacts with websites using an instrumented vulnerable browser hosted on a virtual machine the virtual machine is created on the fly when the scan is requested the service then navigates the site automatically and by observing the behavior of the system the web browser is hosted on via the instrumentation the service can detect when activities associated with malware take place so instead of looking for something specific in the content itself it is instead looking for what the browser and host do when pages are loaded behavioral analysis is superior in many ways to traditional malware detection methods because it can identify even zeroday malware that has not yet been analyzed to create a detection signature malware scan report look for malware close to home now that we have discussed how each service works and the differences in their detection techniques we can discuss some other differences in web application vulnerability testing and malware detection  while web application vulnerabilities can be expected in both internal and external web applications website malware is typically found only on internet facing web applications this is because malware distributors want to infect as many users as possible so hosting malware on sites that have the most exposure is the most effective approach malware is also typically not likely to be distributed evenly on websites unlike vulnerabilities which are usually distributed throughout a web application because they are unintentional malware is usually found on pages that are closer to the home page for the site this is also to take advantage of the traffic patterns of users that will typically be heavier in the pages that are the fewest clicks away from the default for the site so while was will scan a large number of pages to ensure it is testing all the relevant functions thatmay be vulnerable mds will seek to test just the unauthenticated pages that are closest to the default page for a site where malware is most likely to be found another difference between the services that is important to note is the impact while was is actively testing websites by injecting payloads and therefore usually requires advanced notice or scheduling in a maintenance window for production sites the mds service is purely observational and does not have any more impact on a site than a normal user would this allows mds to be run more often and without the notification that is typically required for running a vulnerability scan malware threat detail to bring these two services together qualys has added the ability to configure malware scanning for external web applications that are licensed in qualysguard was when an internet accessible web application is being setup in was the user will now have the option to indicate that they would like it to be scanned for malware this will setup a daily scheduled malware scan for the site if any malware is discovered the mds service notifies the subscription owner with an email outlining the issue users can login to qualysguard to see more details if needed  so now organizations have an easy way to combine web applicationscanning and malware detection to ensure that their internet facing websites are free from web application vulnerabilities and malware burp suite professional integration last but not least qualysguard was  also introduces a first in a series of integrations with attack proxy tools used primarily to conduct more advanced manual application penetration and validation testing while was is designed to be fully automated and scalable and is appropriate for the security testing requirements of the majority of applications there are some web applications that require higher levels of assurance these applications typically require both automated scanning as well as manual penetration testing activities in most cases web application penetration testing is primarily conducted with the use of attack proxy tools such as burp suite attack proxies provide a high level of control that helps to facilitate the depth of testing when it is required recognizing that there is a place for both automated scanning and attack proxies qualys is moving to combine the best of both approaches by integrating attack proxy tools enabling customers to benefit from highly automated and scalable scanning while at the same time having access to manual tools when additional exploitation or risk evaluation is required qualysguard was  takes the first step in this evolution by integrating the scan results from burp suite professional bsp bsp is a tool that combines many different interactive testing capabilities with scanning testers who use bsp can scan individual pages as they navigate a web application and discover vulnerabilities as they do so  but bsp is primarily intended for use by a single user there is no centralized storage for results that would allow them to be shared by multiple users or to be tracked and trended over time qualys seeks to overcome this limitation by providing a way to import the bsp scanner findings this gives organizations a way to store the findings discovered in the bsp scanner with those discovered by qualysguard was  upcoming versions of qualysguard was are planned to extend the integration with bsp and other attack proxies by supporting the ability to define vulnerabilities that are discovered through manual testing with attack proxies and storing these along with the was automated findings this will provide organizations a way to store and manage all the web application testing data together on one platform  qualys will also seek to send http request information directly to the proxy that was used by was to identify a specific vulnerability this will help penetration testers who use attack proxies to more fully explore the level of risk that may be associated with a specific vulnerability as you can tell qualysguard was  is a major release with a lot of new capabilities that will help organizations better combat the growing threats to their web applications we’re excited by the new was  and we look forward to getting it into your hands no comments permalink tags  burp malware product news was add pen testing to web app scanning for more security posted by willb in qualys technology on february   while organizations increasingly adopt web applications to work and conduct business online they often struggle to keep them secure and to protect critical business and customer data recent studies confirm that attackers are increasingly targeting web applications to breach the security defenses of organizations the verizon  data breach investigation report indicates that for large organizations  of the hacking vectors for the investigated breaches were associated with web applications but as the problem has grown so too has the difficulty in hiring and retaining the highly skilled security professionals needed to ensure an organization has identified all the vulnerabilities that may be present in their mission critical web applications some of this pressure has been absorbed by the emergence of highly automated web application vulnerability scanners such as qualysguard was these vulnerability scanners provide the ability to assess web applications in an automated way that reduces the need for trained security professionals and provides broad detection coverage of many of the most significant web application vulnerabilities such as those identified by the open web application security project owasp top  including injection and crosssite scripting xss automated scanning for these types of vulnerabilities is fast and accurate because the scanner is very good at injecting certain attack payloads and then checking for specific feedback in the application response in the vast majority of cases it is easy for the scanner to determine from the response if the application is vulnerable automated scanning is much more scalable and cost effective for identifying these security vulnerabilities than using trained security personnel and as such it can also be used to provide continuous monitoring for highrisk applications however automated scanning may not be sufficient there are a number of web application vulnerabilities and business logic security flaws that can only reliably be identified by a trained security professional one example is access control testing it is very difficult if not impossible for an automated scanner to identify when an application is vulnerable to vertical or horizontal privilege escalation vertical privilege escalation or privilege elevation allows a user who has a role with lower privileges to gain access to functionality that should be reserved for users with higher privileges if an attacker can take advantage of a vulnerability to gain access to this higher privilege functionality they have effectively moved up the vertical privilege ranking an example is an ordinary web commerce user who is able to gain access administrative access and lower prices on the web store horizontal privilege escalation is when a user who is in the same role as a second user may be able to access or act on data that should be not be available to the first user in this case the user has not gained access to additional functionality but may have acted on data that should not have been accessed an example of this would be a web commerce user who accesses another user of the web store and orders products to be sent to hisher address of choice automated testing for these types of security flaws is difficult and can lead to an unreasonable number of false positives the only effective way to test for these types of security vulnerabilities is to use trained web application security testers unfortunately hiring and retaining these security professionals is difficult and expensive  even if an organization has web application penetration testing staff the uneven demand for testing makes management difficult spikes in the need for security assessments can easily overwhelm the staff while at other times there may not be enough testing activity to keep these specialized professionals engaged this makes it difficult for most organizations to retain this function over the long term to address these challenges organizations need an approach that combines the fast costeffective automated vulnerability scanning with highly trained security professionals who are equipped with the best tools  this gives organizations the best blend of costeffective automated scanning for all applications with the additional depth of testing required for those mission critical applications that require an additional level of security assurance fig  penetration testing steps to create this service iviz security seamlessly integrated qualysguard was into its cloud portal via the powerful was application programming interface api the restbased qualysguard was api enables customers and partners to conduct all the activities needed to setup web application configurations schedule scans and retrieve scan results iviz incorporated the was automated scanning capability with the api and created a workflow that allows their trained security professionals to confirm identified vulnerabilities for the customer iviz also goes a step above by performing business logic testing manual exploitation and proof of exploitation with their premium service for web applications that require a higher level of assurance fig  example report showing penetration testing results qualysguard was has always been a great way for organizations to identify web application vulnerabilities through highly automated scanning with the iviz partnership qualysguard was can now also identify vulnerabilities for organizations that need the additional security assurance of a web application penetration test no comments permalink tags owasp product news wasv web app automatic scanning is now part of browsercheck business edition posted by jim fulton in qualys technology on december   qualys browsercheck wwwqualyscombrowsercheck our free “online checkup” service now makes it easier for individuals and businesses to know whether their computers are uptodate and safe for surfing the web with browsercheck not only can you see whether or not your browsers and plugins are current with vendors’ latest releases now you can also check your windows pcs for any missing microsoft security updates in addition businesses can have this scanning happen automatically without any user intervention it administrators can now use the enhanced web console in browsercheck business edition to set how often users’ machines are automatically scanned such as daily weekly or monthly get easy instructions for connecting users’ computers to browsercheck continuously track which browsers and plugins are installed on each machine verify that crucial os security settings are enabled and that os security updates are being received view ataglance dashboards and drill down into permachine status browsercheck end user enhancements users who visit browsercheck directly will now see advanced scanning for missing microsoft windows security updates this release provides a simpler way for users on windows pcs to choose how deeply they would like their computers to be scanned instead of having to pick among specific scanning features users now can simply select a type of scan from a dropdown menu basic– scan just the browser that is currently being used and its plugins this is the default type of scan and is like the scan done on nonwindows platforms which can’t use the browsercheck plugin previously this was performed when none of the “scan options” check boxes were selected intermediate– scan all browsers installed on this pc as well as their associated plugins even ones that are disabled this also checks whether important os settings are enabled such as antivirus firewall windows update and dnschanger malware in the previous release this was performed when both of the “scan options” check boxes were selected advanced new in this release – in addition to the checks listed above this option causes browsercheck to identify any missing microsoft windows security updates this is very powerful but may take several minutes to perform browsercheck business edition enhancements it administrators get several new features in browsercheck business edition automated scanning the webbased management console provided by browsercheck business edition now gives it administrators the ability to have corporate pcs scanned every day week or month users on pcs no longer have to manually revisit browsercheckqualyscom the browsercheck plugin will automatically rescan their computer at the appropriate time note that the browsercheck plugin is still very lightweight it only runs when the user’s browser is open unlike heavyweight agents that run in the background all the time this approach gives administrators an efficient reliable way to keep track of what’s installed on each machine and whether it’s still current with vendors’ releases – without interrupting the user easiertouse lists of scans the scans tab now follows the layout used in the assets tab making it easier for administrators to drill down into specific scans done on specific machines faster switching among different tabs to examine data in different ways is now significantly faster than before give it a try if you haven’t already used browsercheck go to wwwqualyscombrowsercheck to try it yourself or sign up for a free browsercheck

firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
