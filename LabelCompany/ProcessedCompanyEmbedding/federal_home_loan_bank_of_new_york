facing automakers convincing young buyers that cars still matter according to the article “a quarter of drivingage folks under  don’t even have a license” those of us who will spend this week stuck in july th traffic may laugh at this but there is substantial evidence that younger consumers are driving fewer miles moving to cities and relying on mass transit last week the census bureau released data that showed that from  to  cities grew at faster rate than suburbs metro areas with at least one million residents grew by  over this period as compared to an increase of  for suburbs when compared sidebyside the numbers do not seem that far apart but considering how suburbs expanded at triple the rate of cities over the last decade it represents a significant shift for our nation our economy which continues to struggle and weak job growth which limits opportunities previously found outside city centers are the leading causes of this urban expansion but the housing market and new opinions on homeownership certainly factor into this shift too the community lender is now faced with a challenge similar to that confronting automakers convincing young consumers that the home still matters the community banker knows that the home still matters not as the quick investment opportunity that many saw it as in the runup to the recession but as a stable foundation from which to build a life and as a commissioner on the bipartisan policy center’s housing commission i have had the opportunity to work alongside many housing experts and policymakers who share my belief in the importance of homeownership but in recent weeks as i have spent more time in washington discussing these issues it has become abundantly clear that a fundamental change in how our housing finance system operates is happening of course change in itself is not a strategy at the home loan bank our challenge is responding to this change and determining where our members want us to be for you as you too respond to these changes over the past  years our economy has been faced with daunting challenges and significant change but the home loan banks have risen to meet every challenge and adapted to each change and eight decades after our inception remain key support beams for our nation’s lending framework i have every belief that regardless of what the future holds for our nation’s economy the community lender will remain a vital part of responsible housing finance and your home loan bank will be there to offer our consistent and proven support every step of the way i am sure that as you read this you are thinking about the changes you have already seen in your business as well as those you anticipate on the horizon throughout the year the home loan bank will conduct a series of outreach efforts to promote a better awareness and understanding of these changes but remember you can provide feedback anytime through email letter or conversation with your calling officer all of us at the home loan bank from each member of the staff to every director on our board are interested in hearing your opinion about the changes you see in your marketplace both now and in the future advances average  billion in may  advances are the main tool home loan banks use to support our members  and in may our members had  billion in advances put to work in their communities  as long as markets remain open and a member has pledged sufficient qualifying collateral and is willing to purchase the requisite amount of capital stock the home loan bank will always continue to lend to our members to help you meet your community’s needs  but as you know better than anyone a community’s needs are always changing  and as you also know the home loan bank offers many services to our members to help you respond to these needs  our community investment programs can be used to help drive job growth and economic development at the local level  our affordable housing program helps our members respond to those in their communities who need the most help  our triplearated letters of credit can be used by members to collateralize a wide range of items including municipal deposits  and our mortgage partnership finance® program provides a competitive secondary market alternative for our membership  by taking advantage of any or all of these options home loan bank members are wellpositioned to meet the challenges of a changing economic environment in washington office of inspector general report the “unsecured lending” transactions referenced in the oig report are actually “fed funds” transactions executed among domestic banks domestic branches of foreign banks and federal agencies at the new york bank these transactions are usually done on an overnight basis typical of financial institutions we participate in the fed funds market largely for liquidity purposes as these excess funds enable us to renew advance maturities and pay off upcoming debt maturities in the event of a market disruption this activity is not absolutely riskfree nor is the alternative costless excess funds left in our reserve account at the federal reserve do not earn interest as a result we balance the various risks in line with the bank’s lowrisk appetite we have always been highly selective with regard to the financial institutions with which we engage in these overnight transactions these institutions are under constant internal review and if an institution does not meet our strict criteria we have strategies and procedures in place to swiftly eliminate corresponding risk exposures while we do engage in fed funds transactions with foreign banks located in the united states we only deal with the strongest banking entities from governments with solid underlying economic fundamentals and the domestic branches of foreign banks own a sizable portion of us assets and are subject to federal reserve regulations accordingly our activities with regards to fed funds transactions reflect our commitment to strong risk management across the bank this week we celebrate our nation’s birthday across the country people will spend their holiday at a backyard barbecue with family or in a pickup softball game in the park with friends or shouldertoshoulder with neighbors for a parade through town however we choose to celebrate in no small way the local lender helps it happen you are as vital a part of the community as our friends families and neighbors and as we move through another year of our country’s history it is important that we make sure that the local lender remains part of our future i wish you all the best this holiday   sincerely alfred a dellibovi president and ceo    safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of

wellpositioned to meet the challenges of a changing economic environment in washington office of inspector general report the “unsecured lending” transactions referenced in the oig report are actually “fed funds” transactions executed among domestic banks domestic branches of foreign banks and federal agencies at the new york bank these transactions are usually done on an overnight basis typical of financial institutions we participate in the fed funds market largely for liquidity purposes as these excess funds enable us to renew advance maturities and pay off upcoming debt maturities in the event of a market disruption this activity is not absolutely riskfree nor is the alternative costless excess funds left in our reserve account at the federal reserve do not earn interest as a result we balance the various risks in line with the bank’s lowrisk appetite we have always been highly selective with regard to the financial institutions with which we engage in these overnight transactions these institutions are under constant internal review and if an institution does not meet our strict criteria we have strategies and procedures in place to swiftly eliminate corresponding risk exposures while we do engage in fed funds transactions with foreign banks located in the united states we only deal with the strongest banking entities from governments with solid underlying economic fundamentals and the domestic branches of foreign banks own a sizable portion of us assets and are subject to federal reserve regulations accordingly our activities with regards to fed funds transactions reflect our commitment to strong risk management across the bank this week we celebrate our nation’s birthday across the country people will spend their holiday at a backyard barbecue with family or in a pickup softball game in the park with friends or shouldertoshoulder with neighbors for a parade through town however we choose to celebrate in no small way the local lender helps it happen you are as vital a part of the community as our friends families and neighbors and as we move through another year of our country’s history it is important that we make sure that the local lender remains part of our future i wish you all the best this holiday   sincerely alfred a dellibovi president and ceo    safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
