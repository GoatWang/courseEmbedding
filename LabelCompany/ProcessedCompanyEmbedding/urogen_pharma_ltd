readies  million ipomay   about urogen pharma urgn donovan jones ipos tech alternative investments ceo venturedealcomventuredealsummaryisraelbased urogen pharma wants to raise  million in an ipo valuing itself at  millionthe company is developing a potentially improved method of delivering treatments for overactive bladder and bladder cancerits rtgel gel formulation approach is promising but the company faces significant competition and will need a lot more money to commercialize its candidatesmy opinion on the ipo is neutral quick take clinicalstage urological treatment company urogen pharma pendingurgn has finalized proposed terms for its ipo aiming to sell  million shares of common stock at a midpoint price of  per share the company is developing a potentially improved method to deliver bladder cancer and overactive bladder treatments while the market is forecasted to grow significantly the company faces major competition from new generation treatments and will likely need much more funding to commercialize its pipeline my opinion on the ipo is neutral company israelbased urogen formerly theracoat was founded in  to develop treatments for a variety of urological conditions including cancer management is headed by ceo ron bentsur who has been with the firm since august  he was previously ceo of keryx biopharmaceuticals nasdaqkerx where he led a successful fda approval using the b regulatory pathway urogen is pursuing b regulatory pathway approvals for various of its product candidates so the ceo’s work history is a definite plus for the firm investors in the company who own more than  of its stock include arkin communication  ownership preipo pontifax partnerships  proquest investments  telormedix sa  and tatham investments  ceo bentsur owns  and chairman arie belldegrun owns  technology urogen has created separate platforms of product candidates mitogel vesigel vesimune these are formulations of the chemotherapy drug mitomycin c a generic which is being used for certain urothelial cancer treatments the formulations are created by the company’s rtgel reverse thermally triggered hydrogel that allows for sustained release of drugs for better treatment of local bladder diseases below is a brief explainer video about urogen’s rtgel process source urogen pharma the current status of urogen’s pipeline is summarized in the table below source urogen urogen has also inlicensed the rights to the use of botox from allergan nyseagn combined with the rtgel process that may help patients suffering from an overactive bladder market and competition according to a report by market research firm globaldata the global bladder cancer market size is expected to more than triple to  billion by  representing a cagr of  which is on the upper end of health condition growth rates growth drivers include increased incorporation of immunotherapies…the launch of new combination therapies increased incident cases and the introduction of three new competitive agents cold genesys  cg eleven biotherapeutics nasdaqebio  vicinium eli lilly nyselly  cyramza additionally the fda has recently approved tecentriq for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma there are a number of other major pharma firms developing treatments for lowgrade and highgrade nmibc and cis such as merck sharp  dohme mrk astellas pharma otcpkalpmy and others financials urogen’s recent financial results can be summarized as follows  revenues of  million from allergan for its exclusive license this revenue is very lumpy and the company may receive certain other payments only upon the successful completion of specified regulatory and commercialization milestones below are the company’s operational results for the past two years audited gaap source urogen fa as of december   the company had  million in cash and equivalents and  million in total liabilities management stated that it expects expenses associated with multiple later stage clinical trials to increase substantially unless the company can offset these expenses with additional success milestone payments from allergan it is likely to need additional significant funding to finalize trials and commercialize its lead candidates possibly resulting in material dilution for shareholders ipo details urogen intends to raise  million in gross proceeds from an ipo of  million common shares at a midpoint price of  per share management says it will use the net proceeds from the ipo as follows approximately  million to complete our single pivotal phase  clinical trial of mitogel for the treatment of lowgrade utuc approximately  million to file an ind for and to initiate our phase b clinical trial of vesigel for the treatment of lowgrade nmibc and the remainder to fund continued research and clinical development of our other product candidates including vesimune and for working capital and other general corporate purposes listed underwriters of the ipo are jefferies cowen and company raymond james and oppenheimer  co commentary with urogen what investors should really evaluate is whether its proprietary rtgel approach will indeed improve delivery of bladder condition treatments by creating a more efficacious method of retaining the drug within the bladder for a longer period of time potentially improving patient outcomes allergan’s upfront payment of  million for urogen’s botugel botox is a promising indicator of support for the company’s approach for treating overactive bladder also management stated that certain of its existing investors have indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of approximately  million of our ordinary shares in this offering at the initial public offering price this is a material and positive expression of interest nonbinding for almost onehalf of the ipo and is not uncommon for life science companies to effect in order to successfully float their offerings my best guess is that the company will succeed in its ipo at some price at the proposed  per share midpoint urogen would have a postipo market capitalization of approximately  million with relatively few clinical stage biopharma firms showing significant revenues even if lumpy milestonetype revenues management has a positive story to tell institutional investors additionally the bladder cancer treatment market appears to be growing dramatically which is a plus for urogen the downsides to the deal are several competition is strong and competitive therapies can come not only from single drugs but also from combinations it is highly probable the company will need to raise more equity to fund its ambitious pipeline likely diluting public shareholders in the process urogen does not have a major collaboration partner exallergan for botox and thus is in the position of being a small fish in a very big pond with other very large fish swimming around for those reasons my opinion on the ipo is neutral for riskon investors you could do worse

after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase  additional ordinary shares in full we estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash resources to advance our clinical pipeline including specifically  approximately  million to complete our single pivotal phase  clinical trial of mitogel for the treatment of lowgrade utuc  approximately  million to file an ind for and to initiate our phase b clinical trial of vesigel for the treatment of lowgrade nmibc and  the remainder to fund continued research and clinical development of our other product candidates including vesimune and for working capital and other general corporate purposes due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval process it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for any of the above purposes on a standalone basis pending our application of the net proceeds from this offering we plan to invest such proceeds in depositary institutions the standard of care for treating nmibc patients is the turbt procedure for tumor resection followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy instillations administered to prevent reseeding of the cancerous cells the adjuvant agents used are predominately generic treatments and regimens only four drugs have been approved for bladder cancer thiotepa which was approved by the fda in  bcg which was approved by the fda in  valstar which was approved by the fda in  and tecentriq which was approved by the fda in  despite the approval of these drugs there remain high unmet needs in the bladder cancer market bcg has been used to treat patients with cis and highgrade t since  thiotepa and valstar are rarely used mmc is used offlabel as the standard adjuvant treatment in the postturbt setting for lowgrade nmibc patients and tecentriq is used to treat locally advanced or metastic urothelial carcinoma only offlabel means that while the fda has not approved mmc as adjuvant treatment in the postturbt setting for lowgrade nmibc patients physicians are permitted to utilize it as standard of care for this indication as part of medical practice however offlabel usage as a standard of care does not change the fda’s approval criteria and does not suggest that fda approval is more likely than for other investigational drugs in the utuc space there are no approved drugs used to treat the disease tumor resection surgeries are conducted in some cases of lowgrade utuc however partial or complete kidney and upper urothelial tract removal is the standard of care for frequently recurring utuc there are several products in the development pipeline most of which are second or third linetreatments mainly targeted for highgrade nmibc patients who have failed bcg treatment all are targeted to reduce recurrence but none are developed to reduce the need for turbt and other tumor resection therapies we are aware that other companies such as merck sharp  dohme corp viventia bio inc telesta therapeutics inc heat biologics inc viralytics limited aadi llc biocancell ltd halozyme therapeutics inc astellas pharma inc cold genesys inc altor bioscience corporation fkd therapies oy nippon kayaku co ltd spectrum pharmaceuticals inc taris biomedical llc and handok inc are conducting or have recently conducted clinical trials for product candidates for the treatment of lowgrade and highgrade nmibc including cis in addition we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies that are developing drug candidates for muscleinvasive bladder cancer the us food and drug administration approved tecentriq atezolizumab for the treatment of locally advanced or metastic urothelial carcinoma a form muscle invasive bladder cancer on may   we do not know whether these potential competitors are already developing or plan to develop lowgrade utuc or highgrade utuc treatments or other indications that we are pursuing in addition we face competition from existing standards of treatment including turbt which is surgery for bladder cancer if we are not able to demonstrate that our product candidates are at least as safe and effective as such courses of treatment medical professionals may not adopt our product candidates to replace the existing standard of care which is a firstline tumor surgical procedure for both bladder cancer and utuc the biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change our potential competitors include large and experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages over us such as greater financial research and development manufacturing personnel and marketing resources greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities these companies may develop new drugs to treat the indications that we target or seek to have existing drugs approved for use for the treatment of the indications that we target these potential competitors may therefore introduce competing products without our prior knowledge and without our ability to take preemptive measures in anticipation of their commercial launch competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in this industry our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis products that are more effective easier to administer or less costly than our product candidates company description we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies designed to change the standard of care for urological pathologies we have an innovative and broad pipeline of product candidates that we believe can overcome the deficiencies of current treatment options for a variety of urological conditions with a focus on urooncology our lead product candidates mitogel and vesigel are proprietary formulations of the chemotherapy drug mitomycin c or mmc a generic drug which is currently used offlabel for urothelial cancer treatment only in a waterbased formulation as an adjuvant or supplemental postsurgery therapy we are developing our product candidates as chemoablation agents which means they are designed to remove tumors by nonsurgical means to treat several forms of nonmuscle invasive urothelial cancer including lowgrade upper tract urothelial carcinoma or utuc and lowgrade bladder cancer we believe that mitogel and vesigel which are both local drug therapies have the potential to significantly improve patients’ quality of life by replacing costly suboptimal and burdensome tumor resection surgeries as the firstline standard of care mitogel and vesigel may also reduce the need for bladder kidney and upper urothelial tract removals which are typically performed on patients whose cancer progresses despite undergoing tumor resection surgical procedures additionally we believe that our product candidates which are based on novel formulations of approved drugs may qualify for streamlined regulatory pathways to market approval we believe that urothelial cancer which is comprised of bladder cancer and utuc affects a large and underserved patient population annual expenditures for medicare alone in the united states for the treatment of urothelial cancer were estimated to be at least  billion in  and are projected to be at least  billion in  the majority of the historical expenditures was spent on tumor resection surgeries such as transurethral resection of bladder tumor or turbt and bladder kidney and upper urothelial tract removals in  the estimated prevalence of urothelial cancer in the united states was  with an annual incidence of approximately  the  prevalence of each of lowgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer or nmibc and lowgrade utuc in the united states was approximately  and  respectively no drugs have been approved by the us food and drug administration or the fda for the treatment of nmibc in more than  years mitogel and vesigel are formulated using our proprietary reverse thermally triggered hydrogel or rtgel technology we believe that rtgelbased drug formulations which provide for the sustained release of an active drug may improve the efficacy of treatment of various types of urothelial cancer without compromising the safety of the patient or interfering with the natural flow of fluids in the urinary tract our formulations are designed to achieve this by increasing the dwell time as well as the tissue coverage throughout the organ of the active drug consequently we believe that rtgelbased drug formulations may enable us to overcome the anatomical and physiological challenges that have historically contributed to the lack of drug development for the treatment of urothelial cancer mitogel and vesigel are administered locally using the standard practice of intravesical instillation directly into the bladder or upper urothelial tract via a catheter instillation is expected to take place in the physician’s office as a sameday treatment in comparison with turbt or similar tumor surgical procedures which are operations conducted under general anesthesia in a hospital setting and often require at least an overnight stay tumor surgical procedures often have limited success due to the inability to properly identify reach and resect all tumors we believe that an effective chemoablation agent can potentially provide better eradication of tumors irrespective of the detectability and location of the tumors in addition by removing the need for surgery patients may avoid potential complications associated with surgery and hospitalacquired infections we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of mitogel our novel sustainedrelease formulation of mmc in utuc patients pursuant to an ongoing “compassionate use” program “compassionate use” is the use outside of a clinical trial of an investigational or not approved medical product when patient enrollment in a clinical trial is not possible typically due to patient ineligibility or a lack of ongoing clinical trials of the  patients with confirmed lowgrade utuc who have been evaluated endoscopically or through the use of a nonsurgical viewing instrument to examine the urinary tract in the program to date eight have achieved a complete response and five have achieved a partial response at the primary evaluation time of the eight patients who have achieved a complete response at the primary evaluation time three have subsequently experienced recurrences to date thus far in this compassionate use program mitogel has been observed to be welltolerated we have obtained orphan drug designation for mitogel for the treatment of utuc in november  we filed an investigational new drug or ind application with the fda for mitogel which was accepted by the fda in december  we commenced a single pivotal openlabel singlearm phase  clinical trial for the treatment of lowgrade utuc in the first quarter of  we intend to pursue the fda’s b regulatory pathway for mitogel which is a streamlined lowercost and more welldefined pathway to drug approval when compared to traditional drug development we believe that mitogel has the potential to become the first fdaapproved drug for the treatment of lowgrade utuc serving as a firstline chemoablation agent sparing patients from repeated tumor resection surgeries and potentially reducing the need for kidney and upper urothelial tract removals in addition we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of vesigel our novel sustainedrelease high dose formulation of mmc for the treatment of lowgrade nmibc in a phase  study being conducted in europe and israel this study is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  to date  of  or approximately  of the patients evaluated in our ongoing phase a clinical trial who were treated in the vesigel high dose group mg mmc achieved a complete response at the primary evaluation time moreover approximately  of the patients who achieved a complete response at the primary evaluation time and who have been followed for  months thereafter without receiving additional treatments remained recurrence free this compares to approximately  to  of patients who historically achieve a month durable complete response with turbt as firstline treatment followed by adjuvant treatments of mmc instillations into the bladder we plan to file an ind for vesigel in the second half of  and if accepted to commence a phase b clinical trial for vesigel shortly thereafter we also intend to pursue a b regulatory pathway for vesigel we believe that vesigel has the potential to replace tumor resection surgery and become the new firstline standard of care for the treatment of lowgrade nmibc our clinical stage pipeline also includes vesimune our proprietary immunotherapy product candidate for the treatment of highgrade nmibc which may include carcinoma in situ or cis vesimune is a novel liquid formulation of imiquimod a generic tolllike receptor  or tlr agonist tolllike receptor agonists play a key role in initiating the innate immune response system we believe that the combination of vesimune with additional immunotherapy drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy drugs like vesigel could represent a valid alternative to the current standard of care for the post turbt adjuvant treatment of highgrade nmibc botugel is our proprietary novel rtgelbased formulation of botox a branded drug that we believe can potentially serve as an effective treatment option for patients suffering from overactive bladder in october  we announced the licensing of the worldwide rights to botugel to allergan pharmaceuticals international limited or allergan a wholly owned subsidiary of allergan plc which plans to commence a phase  clinical trial of botugel in the second half of  pursuant to the exclusive license agreement we entered into with allergan in october  or the allergan agreement  we were incorporated under the laws of the state of

required in current treatment method the objective is to treat several forms of invasive urothelial cancer low grade bladder cancer and lowgrade upper tract urothelial carcinoma because product

approvals and marketing the licensed products globally and urogen will receive tiered royalties on global net sales currently the annual expenditures in the united states for the treatment of

presentations corporate governance sec filings investor faqs information request contact contact us rtgel™ home » platforms » rtgel™ rtgel™ sustained release formulation for local administration of chemotherapy we have developed rtgel a novel proprietary polymeric biocompatible reverse thermal gelation hydrogel which unlike the general characteristics of most forms of matter is liquid at lower temperatures and converts into gel form when heated we believe that these characteristics promote ease of delivery into and retention of drugs in body cavities including the bladder and the upper urothelial tract by conforming to the anatomy of the target organ while preventing rapid excretion of the drug rtgel when formulated with an active drug may allow for the improved efficacy of treatment of various types of urothelial cancer without compromising the safety of the patient or interfering with the natural flow of fluids from the urinary tract to the bladder rtgel achieves this by increasing the exposure of active drugs in the bladder and upper urothelial tract by significantly extending the dwell time of the active drug while conforming to the anatomy of the bladder and the upper urothelial tract which allows for enhanced drug tissue coverage for example the average dwell time of the standard mmc water formulation currently used as adjuvant treatment in the upper urothelial tract is approximately five minutes compared to approximately six hours when mmc is formulated with rtgel administering higher doses of an active drug than would otherwise be possible using standard waterbased formulations for instance it is only possible to dissolve  mg of mmc in  ml of water while it is possible to formulate up to  mg of mmc with  ml of rtgel and maintaining the active drug’s molecular structure and mode of action these characteristics of rtgel enable sustained release of mmc in the urinary tract for both mitogel and vesigel and of botulinum toxin in the case of botugel further rtgel may be particularly effective in the bladder and upper urothelial tract where tumor visibility and access are challenging and where there exists a significant amount of urine flow and voiding we believe that these characteristics of rtgel may prove useful for the local delivery of active drugs to other bodily cavities in addition to the bladder and upper urothelial tract

immune modulating drugs for intravesical use urogen pharma is developing a unique immunemodulation drug candidate vesimune imiquimod based on toll like receptors tlr stimulators tlrs are pattern recognition receptors prrs and their importance in stimulating innate and adaptive immunity is well established tlrs are sensors of microbial components as well as hostderived endogenous molecules released by injured tissues tlrs play a critical role in defense against invading pathogens but are also involved in other serious pathological processes such as tumorigenesis tlr can be expressed on members of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as by endothelial and epithelial cells more recently tlr have been found on tumor cells growing evidence is being collected of tlrs activation efficacy in arming the immune system against cancer cells imiquimod is approved in the us in a topical formulation for genital warts superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis   imiquimod is an imidazoquinoline synthetic immune modulator which target tlr and a potent inducer of immune stimulatory cytokines –including interferonalpha ifnα tnfα interleukin ilβ and il and exerts consistent antitumor effects in animal models  tlr expression on bladder cancer cells has been reported imiquimod is believed to also adjuvant properties eliciting an adaptive immune response in the

urothelial carcinoma low grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer carcinoma in situ of the bladder overactive bladder publications clinical trials platforms rtgel™ immunotherapy investors press releases events  presentations corporate governance sec filings investor faqs information request contact contact us platforms home » platforms urogen pharma candidate products are based on two proprietary platform technologies rtgel – a novel proprietary polymeric biocompatible reverse thermal gelation hydrogel unlike the general characteristics of most forms of matter rtgel is liquid at lower temperatures and converts into gel form when heated we believe that these characteristics promote ease of delivery into and retention of drugs in body cavities including the bladder and the upper urothelial tract by conforming to the anatomy of the target organ while preventing rapid excretion of the drug  rtgel’s components are polymerbased and are inactive ingredients that have been approved by the fda for use in other products such as oraqix a periodontal gel namenda an oral solution for alzheimer’s disease and xeloda an oral chemotherapy we formulate rtgel with an active drug mmc in the case of mitogel and vesigel and botulinum toxin in the case of botugel the resulting formulations are instilled intravesically in liquid form directly into the bladder or upper urothelial tract using standard instillation methodologies via catheters and thereafter convert into gel form at body temperature subsequently upon contact with urine rtgel gradually dissolves and releases the active drug over a period of several hours and is less affected by urine creation and voiding cycles as compared to water formulations rtgel when formulated with an active drug may allow for the improved efficacy of treatment of various types of urothelial cancer without compromising the safety of the patient or interfering with the natural flow of fluids from the urinary tract to the bladder rtgel achieves this by increasing the exposure of active drugs in the bladder and upper urothelial tract by significantly extending the dwell time of the active drug while conforming to the anatomy of the bladder and the upper urothelial tract which allows for enhanced drug tissue coverage for example the average dwell time of the standard mmc water formulation currently used as adjuvant treatment in the upper urothelial tract is approximately five minutes compared to approximately six hours when mmc is formulated with rtgel administering higher doses of an active drug than would otherwise be possible using standard waterbased formulations for instance it is only possible to dissolve  mg of mmc in  ml of water while it is possible to formulate up to  mg of mmc with  ml of rtgel and maintaining the active drug’s molecular structure and mode of action these characteristics of rtgel enable sustained release of mmc in the urinary tract for both mitogel and vesigel and of botulinum toxin in the case of botugel further rtgel may be particularly effective in the bladder and upper urothelial tract where tumor visibility and access are challenging and where there exists a significant amount of urine flow and voiding we believe that these characteristics of rtgel may prove useful for the local delivery of active drugs to other bodily cavities in addition to the bladder and upper urothelial tract immunotherapy – locally triggering the innate immune system via unique formulation of immune modulating drugs for intravesical use based on this technology urogen pharma is developing a unique immunemodulation drug candidate vesimune™ based on toll like receptors  tlr stimulators for the treatment of carcinoma in situ cis of the bladder rtgel immunotherapy about urogen
