best regards robert s dow chairman              expense example as a shareholder of the fund you incur ongoing costs including management fees distribution and service b fees currently only class b shares have an active b plan and other fund expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period january   through june   actual expenses for each class of the fund the first line of the applicable table on the following page provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading titled expenses paid during period    to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes for each class of the fund the second line of the table on the following page provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds          please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs would have been higher          beginning account value     ending account value

notes to financial statements       organization lord abbett us government  government sponsored enterprises money market fund inc the fund is registered under the investment company act of  as amended the act as a diversified openend management investment company the fund was incorporated under maryland law on may   the investment objective of the fund is to seek high current income and preservation of capital through investments in high quality shortterm liquid securities these securities are commonly known as money market instruments the fund has four classes of shares classes a b c and i there are no frontend sales charges on shares of each class although there may be a contingent deferred sales charge cdsc applied to a class of shares as follows certain redemptions of class a shares acquired through an exchange class b shares redeemed before the sixth anniversary of purchase and class c shares redeemed before the first anniversary of purchase class b shares will automatically convert to class a shares on the  th day of the month or if the  th day is not a business day the next business day thereafter following the eighth anniversary of the day on which the purchase order was accepted the fund no longer issues class b shares for purchase the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates     significant accounting policies   a   investment valuation the fund values securities utilizing the amortized cost method which approximates fair value under the amortized cost method all investments purchased at a discount or premium are valued by amortizing the difference between the original purchase price and maturity value of the issue over the period to maturity securities purchased at face value are valued at cost which approximates fair value due to the short duration of the issue   b   security transactions security transactions are recorded as of the date that the securities are purchased or sold trade date realized gains and losses on sales of portfolio securities are calculated using the identifiedcost method   c   investment income interest income is recorded on the accrual basis as earned discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized using the effective interest method and are included in interest income on the statement of operations investment income is allocated to each class of shares based upon the relative proportion of net assets at the beginning of the day   d   income taxes it is the policy of the fund to meet the requirements of subchapter m of the internal revenue code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all taxable income and capital gains to its shareholders therefore no income tax provision is required    notes to financial statements continued   the fund files us federal and various state and local tax returns no income tax returns are currently under examination the statute of limitations on the funds us federal tax returns filed remains open for the fiscal years ended june   through june   the statutes of limitations on the funds state and local tax returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon the jurisdiction   e   expenses expenses excluding classspecific expenses are allocated to each class of shares based upon the relative proportion of net assets at the beginning of the day class b shares bear all expenses and fees relating to the funds b distribution plan   f   repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with respect to securities a repurchase agreement is a transaction in which a fund acquires a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller a bank or securities dealer at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon date the fund requires at all times that the repurchase agreement be collateralized by cash or by securities of the us government its agencies its instrumentalities or us government sponsored enterprises having a value equal to or in excess of the value of the repurchase agreement including accrued interest if the seller of the agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying securities at a time when the fair value of these securities has declined the fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the securities   g   time deposits the fund may invest in time deposits time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained at a banking institution for a specified period of time often overnight at a specified interest rate   h   fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that the fund would receive upon selling an investment or transferring a liability in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment a threetier hierarchy is used to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk  for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as a pricing model andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability unobservable inputs are based on the best information available in the circumstances the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below        level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical investments        level   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc and        level   significant unobservable inputs including the funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities    notes to financial statements continued   the following is a summary of the inputs

statements concluded   the fund generally invests a substantial portion of its assets in money market securities issued by the us government and by various governmentsponsored enterprises such as federal home loan mortgage corporation the federal home loan banks and federal national mortgage association such securities are not guaranteed by the us government but are supported only by the credit of the particular governmentsponsored enterprises involved and the discretionary authority of the us treasury to purchase the enterprises obligations there is no assurance that the us government will provide financial support to enterprises that are not supported by the full faith and credit of the us government an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency although the fund seeks to preserve the value of an investment at  per share it is possible to lose money by
