association of commerce schlifske received a bachelor’s degree in economics from carleton college and a master’s degree in finance and accounting from the kellogg graduate school of management at northwestern university company brief northwestern mutual wwwnorthwesternmutualcom is the marketing name for the northwestern mutual life insurance company and its subsidiaries northwestern mutual was among the “world’s most admired” life insurance companies in  according to fortune® magazine and has helped clients achieve financial security for more than  years northwestern mutual and its subsidiaries offer a holistic approach to financial security solutions including life insurance longterm care insurance disability income insurance annuities investment products and advisory products and services what has enabled northwestern mutual to perform so effectively year after year we are constantly focused on improving our relevance with clients policyowners potential clients and so on it all centers on relevance if you go back  years the relevance of this company was dependent on one key product – life insurance – which we did a good job of manufacturing and distributing today we see that there is a lack of financial planning for people throughout their life stages we have remained relevant because we have evolved into a company focused on filling the gap around this lack of planning the innovation we have driven at northwestern mutual is not around product features or social media – although we’re in good shape in both areas –but how our relevance to our clients has evolved and strengthened over the past  years the industry faces a key issue which is that a lot of products are sold in a transactional format there is nothing wrong with that approach but it’s just a product sale – it’s not tied to holistic planning we’re evolving to provide one plan and a lifetime relationship with a trusted advisor because of that our growth is accelerating many talk about the complexities of this business what do you look for in your people today the first is the notion of being well trained that is not just the classic chartered life underwriter clu designation but it’s also evident by other designations chartered financial consultants cfc certified financial planners cfp chartered advisors for senior living casl and others the education and credentialing of our field force is growing the second thing is that our field force understands that they have to continually acquire knowledge throughout their careers also the way our representatives are working is changing in the old days they were like lone rangers increasingly they’re partnering we don’t expect our reps to know every technical detail about everything especially when they’re merging the investment side of a client’s portfolio with the insurance side of his needs as we have so they partner with those who complement them are people aware of the critical nature of financial planning thirty or forty years ago when it came to retirement the average person was relying on social security but also the value of a home and a pension those things have become less significant and people nationwide have had to learn more about planning for themselves but as a country we haven’t made the shift to actively planning it has been noted that people spend more time planning a vacation than their retirement this is why we’re confident that the role of a trusted advisor is relevant today the advisor brings discipline not just in creating the plan but in helping the client stick to it we do believe you should start at a young age the eighth wonder of the world is compound interest and the sooner you start that process the better it works for you how critical is it that your workforce mirrors the diversity of your clientele we are laserfocused on it both in the field and the home office we have made a concerted effort around diversity and inclusion and we’re starting to gain traction when i look at the ratio of recruiting and retaining women and people of color to our field force it is improving it’s the same thing in the home office we continue to make progress both at the employee level and the board level part of the reason for our success in this regard is that we are focusing on both inclusiveness and diversity our philosophy is that you have to create the right culture so that all people feel included when they join and so they remain with the company to build their careers from a demographic perspective it’s clear that the us is becoming less caucasian there is no doubt that to fully penetrate the us market we need a workforce that is as diverse as the general population have you been innovative in terms of client offerings do you need to innovate to address the changing needs of customers i don’t think innovation is what consumers are looking for on the product side there are three components to an insurance product your mortality your expenses and your investment component you can repackage this and add bells and whistles and put in guarantees over risk transfer or risk sharing but at day’s end it’s more financial engineering than true innovation it’s moving risktaking from one group of policyowners to another or from policyowners to shareholders there have been plenty of new products introduced in the market that lower the premium cost to policyowners but not necessarily the price for the long term where we see innovation is around the planning and the way we deal with clients for instance we have many clients today who are newly married couples and recently out of school they are in mid to lates with few assets little investable net worth lots of debt and a high potential for future income – this is who we work with we are not a stock brokerage firm that needs to have  to make an account profitable we start working with young people right away in terms of disability insurance life insurance and other needs as their family situation changes and they pay off debts perhaps have children and start on the road to affluence we can grow with them the way we have created that is partially on the product side but primarily on the planning side our reps are trained to speak in an educated way with those two young people about disability insurance they can also talk to the two married people at age  who have kids in college and other issues including of course retirement what we have going in the retirement space right now is not just about products it’s about how all of the different products come together in one plan around lifetime income and a legacy be it a charitable legacy or passing money on to heirs so what is innovative is how we package those products in a retirement planning module we have even applied for a patent on it have you put metrics in place to track service standards we are very serviceoriented and we have all sorts of service metrics to determine for instance how fast calls get answered and how quickly the policyowners’ questions are handled with our system a lot of our servicing is handled by our financial representatives who are hiring more people to work with them because the service requirements of their customer base are increasing the single best way we measure service quality is something we call persistency it’s the inverse of our lapse rates our persistency is the percentage of people in a given year that don’t let their products lapse our persistency rate is in the  to  percent range we’re spending a lot more money on consumerfacing technology that helps reinforce relevancewhat is interesting is that this persistency rate is roughly the same on the insurance side of our business as it is on the investment side so even for people who have investment accounts with our brokerdealer or with our wealth management company we’re seeing persistency rates in the very high s there is more than product performance driving that some of that is service level we think that persistency is the best way to track total client satisfaction what type of impact has technology had on the business historically we have spent a great deal of money on technology for the back office running our operations calculating policy dividends and cash values processing work it’s something the client never sees but it makes us an efficient company in addition to that it’s important to spend money on clientfacing technology it’s how a client experiences northwestern mutual it’s having a consolidated view of all of a client’s products including products that we don’t sell but the client owns from a different relationship it’s also the ability to see the client’s plan and evaluate if he’s on or off track with it we’re spending a lot more money on consumerfacing technology that helps reinforce relevance but we’re trying to do it in a way that is integrated not just with the back office but with social media and the clients’ ability to share information with their advisors we don’t view technology as an ipad app we see it as integration around your financial plan your relationship with your advisor and your relationship with northwestern mutual is there a good understanding and awareness of the benefits that this industry offers i see more of a lack of understanding the amount of benefits paid out by the life insurance industry on a daily basis is substantial and it compares favorably with the size of benefits paid out by the social security administration on a daily basis what we’re ultimately selling is peace of mind and the notion that it’s a feeling not a product the reason why the industry got behind is because of the phenomenal bull market americans lived through from  to  it created an environment where people thought it was easy to accumulate money – all you had to do was throw your money into a k and you’d be richwhat people are increasingly seeing is the stability the industry offers the fact that we are there when times are good but also when they’re bad the life insurance industry took a back seat but what people are increasingly seeing is the stability the industry offers the fact that we are there when times are good but also when they’re bad the industry’s reputation is being reevaluated by consumers what makes an effective ceo a ceo has to do two or three things really well for starters it’s having a vision setting a course of action and getting everyone to collaborate and work towards that a good ceo also has to set standards of high performance – and i don’t just mean financial it’s about being exceptional in everything we do and setting those bars high generally if you do all of the little things right the big things come together we have spent a lot of time over the past several years focusing on how we need to get better even though we’re arguably the best company in the industry we can’t rest we constantly have to raise our standards – the best must get better in order to maintain preeminence the last thing i try to do is focus on “creating the future” so it’s more than a vision – it’s seeing where we need to be four to six years out in order to be just as relevant as we are now we call it creating the future because it’s not just seeing where we need to go – it’s creating the environment to get us there do you ever take time to reflect on northwestern mutual’s success i make a conscious effort to do that i close almost every public forum where i’m speaking with an advisory to enjoy the journey northwestern mutual is a yearold company hopefully we will be around for another  years there is no end point in our history so we think about the minimilestones along the way this way we can stop and enjoy the journey• click here to

america many chief executive officers have become household names thanks to notoriety excessive pay or even personal charm but what about those leaders who simply excel at their jobssome of them according to a new survey from employment site glassdoor are well known corporate celebrities while most americans have never heard of others the common thread however is that their employees feel their ceos are accessible dedicated and convey a clear mission to the rank and file glassdoor ceo and founder robert hohman said in an email to cbs moneywatch what really stands out according to employees is that these ceos have a very clear vision of where their company is heading they communicate their vision to employees including how all employees will play an integral role in meeting company goals hohman wrote while some of the ceos that made the list are household names fame doesnt always equate to company growth or success hohman added what matters most is a ceo who is a strong leader transparent communicative and leads with integrity if all of this happens a company stands a better chance at being successful and the ceo is more likely to engage employees and motivate them he notedthis years list of americas highest rated ceos has one notable omission not a single woman ceo made the list thats likely due to the very low percentage of women ceos in general hohman said only  percent of women hold the ceo post at sp  companies according to catalyst a nonprofit dedicated to expanding opportunities for women in business several women who are ceos have very high ratings such as general motors gm mary barra who has an  percent approval rating although their numbers werent high enough to score a place on the list is there a link between a highly rated ceo and a
