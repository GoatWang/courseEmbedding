logistics ryan mcvayphotodiscgetty images related articles  push vs pull supply chain strategy  upstream and downstream activities for a marketing director  what are the four elements of supply chain management  difference between tier   tier  companies upstream and downstream are business terms applicable to the production processes that exist within several industries industries that commonly use this terminology include the metals industry oil gas biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries upstream downstream and midstream make up the stages of the production process for these and other industries definition of upstream the upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials the upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself such as processing the material this part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material thus any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process in a more general sense upstream can also refer to any part of the production process relating to the extraction stages examples of upstream processes in the petroleum industry locating underground or underwater oil reserves characterizes the upstream process additionally the upstream process in this industry involves bringing oil and gas to the surface extraction wells represent an example of a structure operating in this stage in the process the upstream stage in the production process may also manifest itself as a supplier providing raw materials to manufacturers or other businesses that ultimately process the materials definition of downstream the downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product the downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses governments or private individuals the type of end user will vary depending on the finished product regardless of the industry involved the downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product examples of downstream processes in the oil and gas industry the downstream process consists of converting crude oil into other products and then selling those products to customers thus oil refineries represent structures that operate within the downstream process however any kind of plant that processes raw materials may qualify as operating within the downstream stage of production a company that combines both upstream and downstream processes is an integrated company references  jstor the meaning of upstream and downstream and the implications for modeling vertical merges michael a salinger june 8academia
