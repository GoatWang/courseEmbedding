which the trustee claims the following were breached accuracy of information mlpa i information provided to the rating agencies including loan level detail is true and correct no fraud in origination or servicing mlpa ii no fraud has taken place on the part of the mortgagor or any other party involved in the origination of the mortgage loan compliance with law mlpa vii any and all requirements of any federal state or local law including without limitation usury truth in lending real estate settlement procedures consumer credit protection equal credit opportunity fair housing predatory abusive lending or disclosure laws applicable to the origination and servicing of the mortgage loans have been complied with in all material respects qualified appraisal mlpa xxvii the mortgage file contains an appraisal of the related mortgaged property which satisfied the standards of fannie mae and freddie mac and was made and signed prior to the approval of the mortgage loan application by a qualified appraiser duly appointed by the seller who had no interest direct or indirect in the mortgaged property or in any loan made on the security thereof whose compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the mortgage loan and who met the minimum qualifications of fannie mae and freddie mac each appraisal of the mortgage loan was made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  maximum combined loantovalue ratio mlpa xxxixfn no mortgage loan had a combined loantovalue ratio in excess of  no knowledge of adverse conditions mlpa xxxvi no mortgage loan was selected from the mortgage loans in the sellers portfolio in a manner so as to affect adversely the interests of the purchaser compliance with underwriting guidelines mlpa xxxvii the mortgage loan was originated by or acquired and if acquired by was originated pursuant to the underwriting guidelines of by the seller or by a savings and loan association a savings bank a commercial bank or similar banking institution which is supervised and examined by a federal or state authority or by a mortgagee approved as such by the secretary of hud no highcost loans mlpa xxxviii no loan is a high cost loan or a covered loan as applicable as such terms are defined in standard  poors levels version  glossary revised appendix e     plaintiff also alleges breach of certain provisions of the psa specifically psa section 0bvii which provides that the representations and warranties set forth in section  of the mlpa are true and correct as of the closing date psa section 0b also sets forth additional mortgage representations made by nomura such as section 0bix which provides that no loan is a high cost loan or covered loan as applicable     the remedy for breaches of the mortgage representations is set forth in section c of the mlpa and section 0c of the psa the section provides that within 0 days of the discovery of a breach of any representation or warranty that materially and adversely affects the interests of the certificateholders in any mortgage loan nomura shall cure such breach in all material respects and if such breach is not so cured shall    repurchase the affected mortgage loan or mortgage loans from the trustee at the purchase price     the section also provides that if it is discovered by any of the depositor the seller the securities administrator or the trustee that the substance of such representation and warranty is inaccurate and such inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of the related mortgage loan notwithstanding the sellers lack of knowledge with respect to the substance of such representation or warranty the seller shall nevertheless be required to cure substitute for or repurchase the affected mortgage loan     pursuant to section 0c the sellers obligation    to cure purchase or replace any mortgage loan as to which a breach has occurred    shall constitute the sole remedies against the seller     under psa section 0 enforcement authority is vested in the trustee in addition to the repurchase obligation section v of the mlpa contains a no untrue statement covenant which states that the mlpa does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein not misleading and that the written statements reports and other documents prepared and furnished or to be prepared and furnished by the seller pursuant to this agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby taken in the aggregate do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading the no untrue statement covenant is set forth in a section of the mlpa that is separate from the mortgage representations plaintiff argues that these obligations are not subject to the remedy restrictions in § of the mlpa or §0 of the psa certificate holders who have over  of the voting rights of the trust conducted an investigation into the loans the investigation revealed that many of the loans placed in the trust do not conform with one or more of the mortgage representations and therefore are in breach of the mlpa and psa as described above the mlpa contains a representation that no mortgage loan had a combined loantovalue cltv ratio in excess of  the investigators employed trustee remittance reports and automated valuation models avm to assess the values of properties underlying the loans plaintiff states that a cltv that is reported as lower than its true value materially and adversely affects the value of the loan and therefore the interests of the trust and of the certificate holders the investigation revealed that the values of many of the properties that secured the mortgage loans were inaccurately reported for many of the loans the value determined by the avm was significantly lower than the reported value of the property therefore the actual cltv was higher than the reported cltv because the denominator used to calculate the reported cltv was overstated plaintiff alleges that  of the loans reviewed so far had actual cltv ratios higher than  in violation of the representation in mlpa section  xxix plaintiff also contends that in breach of mlpa §i credit rating agencies were given untrue and incorrect information causing the agencies to assign improper ratings to the different tranches of the rmbs offerings the investigation revealed significant deviations from the metrics nomura provided to the agencies with respect to ltv cltv and the owneroccupancy status of the mortgage loans specifically the investigation revealed  loans as to which owneroccupancy status was inaccurately represented as to the alleged breach of mlpa section xxvii plaintiff contends that the appraisals of the underlying properties were not independent and did not conform to mlpa requirements in support of this claim plaintiff cites public reports and governmental investigations of appraisal fraud and the results of the certificate holders investigation the avm reveal that there were discrepancies between the actual value of the properties and the appraised values with the vast majority of the discrepancies arising from overreporting of the appraised value the investigators found that the appraised value of  properties were at least 0 or more of the true market value as determined by the avm from this result plaintiff argues that there is strong reason to believe that the appraisals did not conform to federal guidelines and were biased because the appraisers were not independent as represented in mlpa §xxvii as to the alleged breach of mlpa §xxxvii underwriting guidelines plaintiff argues that nomura represented that the loans conformed to its own underwriting guidelines no matter what entity originated the loans as well as to federal or state professional appraisal standards the appraisal standards in the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice uspap require that appraisals be independent unbiased and not contingent on a predetermined result plaintiff maintains that a false representation that a loan was secured by a property appraised by an independent appraiser materially and adversely affects the interest of both the trust and the certificate holders in that mortgage loan the certificate holders investigation analyzed cltv ratios of sampled loans to determine whether the appraised values of the loans were made in accordance with established industry practice plaintiff claims that a cltv deviation of  constitutes a material deviation that warrants the conclusion that serious errors occurred in the appraisal process in violation of uspap standards the investigation uncovered that the actual cltv for  loans were at least  greater than that represented on the closing date plaintiff also claims that an inspection of the mortgage loan files revealed additional breaches a comprehensive forensic investigation of those files has been commenced the reunderwriting that investigation has identified material breaches of the mortgage representations in  out of  mortgage loan files as of the date of the amended complaint a whopping  failure rate the reunderwriting found several material breaches including a errors misrepresentations andor gross negligence that was readily apparent on the mortgage loan files b failure to comply with underwriting guidelines including mandated employment income

july  0 defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for want of standing on august  0 counsel for plaintiffs filed an amended complaint substituting the trustee as plaintiff and thereby rendering the motion to dismiss moot defendant states that the trustee agreed to be substituted only after zambezi agreed to indemnify the trustee under the terms of the psa the trustee is authorized to demand indemnification the first cause of action breach of contractspecific performance alleges that nomura failed to repurchase or cure any of the defective loans in violation of section 0c of the psa it seeks specific performance requiring nomura to repurchase the defective loans in the alternative the trustee seeks damages on behalf of the trust the second cause of action breach of contractrescission alleges breach of the no untrue statement covenant plaintiff alleges that the pervasive nature of the breaches constitutes a material breach of the mlpa plaintiff avers that money damages are insufficient because given the breath of the breaches enforcement of nomuras repurchase obligation would burden the trust with an enormous expense and effort of having to reunderwrite each of the mortgages the trust thus seeks rescission of the sale of the mortgage loans the third cause of action breach of contractdamages duplicates the second cause of action except that it seeks compensatory damages as an alternative to rescission discussionnomura advances three arguments in support of its motion to dismiss  statute of limitations  rescission and damages are not available because the contract limits remedies to substitution repurchase or cure of the offending loan and  failure to state a cause of action because the amended complaint does not adequately allege that any mortgage representation was breached the court need only address the first of these upon a proper motion any cause of action that is barred by the statute of limitations must be dismissed see cplr a the statute of limitations for breach of contract is six years see cplr   a cause of action for breach of contract accrues at the time of the breach see elycruikshank co v bank of montreal  nyd  0  knowledge of the occurrence of the wrong on the part of the plaintiff is not necessary to start the statute of limitations running in a contract action id at 0 citation and internal quotation marks omitted the mortgage representations were first made on december   the date as of which naac signed the psa and mlpa that date is more than six years before august  0 the date the trustee was substituted in as plaintiff if the court were to accept that the plaintiffs claims relate back to the date the summons with notice was filed by zambezi december 0 0 the suit would still be timebarred because that date is more than six years after december   the date as of which the psa and mlpa were signed if however the mortgage representations are deemed to have been made as of the closing date december   and the claims were found to relate back then the claims would not be time barredfn nomura contends that under new york law a claim for breach of a contractual representation accrues on the date the representation is made see lehman bros holdings inc v evergreen moneysource mortg co  f supp d  wd wash 0 evergreen and structured mortgage trust  v daiwa fin corp 0 civ   wl  sdny feb   stein j daiwa both are rmbs putback cases applying new york law in daiwa plaintiff alleged that defendant breached representations concerning characteristics of mortgages contained in a psa plaintiff sued more than eight years after the psa was executed the court held the claim was time barred reasoning that since the representations in the psa were not true when made the statute of limitations began to run at that time and expired six yeas later daiwa  wl  at  in evergreen the plaintiff alleged that defendant breached contractual representations concerning the accuracy and truthfulness of information about mortgage loans purchased in  and that the representations were untrue at the time of purchase plaintiff filed suit in  and argued its claim was not timebarred because defendants refusal to repurchase the loan was a separate breach of contract as to which its claim was timely the court held that any duty to repurchase is only triggered by a breach of any representations warranties or covenants evergreen  f supp d at  nomura argues that plaintiffs claims are for breach of representations that occurred if at all no later than december   which is the as of date of the psa and mlpa nomura adds that this is true even if the contract provides that the representations are made as of a future date here the closing date december   see lana  edwards realty corp v katzweinstein partnership  misc d a  sup ct kings county  demarest j nomura thus argues that plaintiffs claims accrued when the mortgage representations were made on december   and expired six years later before zambezi filed suit defendant also argues that even if the relevant accrual date were december   plaintiffs claims are nevertheless untimely because zambezi the plaintiff in the preexisting suit lacked standing to sue and therefore the amended complaint does not relate back to the date the summons with notice was filed by zambezi on december 0 0 defendant argues that zambezis lack of standing is established by the plain terms of the no action clause of the psa which limits certificate holders rights to sue to servicer defaults or master servicer defaults although plaintiff contends that zambezi had standing to sue understandably it does not elaborate in its opposition brief given the decision in walnut place llc  add at  certificate holders action is barred by the no action clause in the psas instead plaintiff emphasizes that even if zambezi did not have standing to sue the claim relates back and the action survives relationback applies to the amendment of claims and parties and is dependent upon the existence of a valid preexisting action southern wine  spirits of am inc v impact envtl engg pllc 0 add 0 00 st dept 0 no valid preexisting action exists when a plaintiff lacks capacity to sue see goldberg v camp mikanrecro  nyd 0   where the original plaintiff lacks standing to sue there is no valid preexisting action for the purposes of the relationback doctrine in face of these precedents plaintiff contends that goldberg has been either overruled or severely restricted by later decisions of the court of appeals plaintiffs memorandum of law p  n  plaintiff cites carrick v central general hospital  nyd  0 and snay v cohoes memorial hosp 0 add 0 0 d dept  for this proposition carrick neither overruled nor severely limited goldberg in carrick the court of appeals interpreted cplr 0 which permits a plaintiff or his representative whose timely claim is dismissed for a variety of reasons including death of the plaintiff and pleading defects up to six months beyond expiration of the limitation period to reinstate his suit in such cases the plaintiff who initiated the suit has standing to sue the court of appeals did not address relationback under cplr 0 f previously cplr 0 e the provision at issue in goldberg and this case where the plaintiff who initiated the case did not have standing and thus had no valid claim when he filed suit see southern wine  spirits of america inc 0 add at 0 0 st dept 0 relation back    is dependent upon the existence of a valid preexisting action see also truty v federal bakers supply corp  add   th dept  holding that where the original action for breach of contract was brought by parties without standing to sue substituted plaintiffs may not serve an amended complaint after the statute of limitations had run because there was no valid preexisting action to which the amended complaint could relate back accordingly the controlling date in this case is august  0 the date the amended complaint was filed to substitute in the trustee as plaintiff plaintiff argues that the amended complaint relates back despite goldberg and some appellate division authority to the contrary plaintiff maintains that the first department has held that where a plaintiff without standing is substituted by a plaintiff with standing after the statute of limitations expires such an amendment relates back to the date of commencement of the action for the purposes of the statute of limitations so long as the substitution does not result in any prejudice or surprise to the defendant see fairbanks capital corp v nagel  add   st dept  in fairbanks the appellate division first department held that the initial plaintiff in its capacity as servicing agent for the trustee which held the mortgage had standing to sue based on the trustees delegation of authority over the subject mortgage id at p  the courts alternative ruling that even if the original plaintiffs status as servicing agent were not sufficient to confer standing upon it the substitution of fairbanks the subsequent assignee of the mortgage relates back to the original commencement of the action    for purposes of the statute of limitations given that the substitution did not result in any prejudice or surprise to defendant is inconsistent with goldberg and the first departments recent decision in southern wine  spirits of america inc 0 add at 0 as the court of appeals reaffirmed in george v mt sinai hsp  nyd 0   a necessary element of any attempt to utilize the relationback provisions of cplr 0f is the existence of a valid preexisting action to which the amendment can relate back as in goldberg the original plaintiff in this case did not have standing to sue and therefore there was no valid preexisting action to which the amendment substituting the trustee can relate plaintiff cites several cases in addition to fairbanks in support of its position those cases are distinguishable all turn on the fact — not present here — that the substituted plaintiff was a closely related corporate affiliate of the original plaintiff see hsbc guyerzeller bank ag v chascona nv  add   st dept 0 substituted plaintiff was affiliate in hsbc family american home assur co v scanlon  add   st dept 0 substituted plaintiff was part of same interrelated group of insurance companies frankart furniture staten is v forest mall assoc  add   st dept 0 leonard frankel and bernard frankel are the principals of both related business entities at oral argument plaintiffs counsel cited additional cases not referenced in its brief where courts purportedly have held that an amendment substituting in a plaintiff with standing for a plaintiff without standing relates back to the commencement of the action for statute of limitations purposes with permission of the court plaintiffs counsel submitted a letter listing several cases the new york state court cases cited are readily distinguishable in matter of highland hall apts llc v new york

little things mean a lot inc  wl 0 sd ny aug   no civ0ags the court allowed the plaintiff who initially lacked standing to join a closely affiliated corporate plaintiff that had a valid claim plaintiff also argues that its claims are not barred by the statute of limitations because each refusal of nomura to repurchase the defective mortgages is an independent breach of contract separate and apart from the representations on this theory plaintiff argues that defendant has a continuing obligation to repurchase all defective mortgages and therefore the cause of action does not accrue until that obligation itself is breached see bulova watch co v celotex corp  nyd 0  in bulova the defendant sold plaintiff roofing materials and provided a bond in which it agreed to make any repairs necessary to maintain the roof in watertight condition for a period of twenty years more than six years later plaintiff filed suit after the roof had developed leaks which defendant failed to fix defendant maintained that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations the court held that the suit was not timebarred reasoning that the bond obligations as agreements contemplating services were subject to a sixyear statute    running separately from the damages occasioned each time a breach of the obligation to repair the bonded roof occurred     for this reason the bond claims arising within six years of the commencement of this suit are timely provided they also arose during the 0year period to which the guarantee relates id at  plaintiff also relies on lehman bros holdings inc v natl bank of ark 0 us dist lexis  at  ed ark june  0 and lasalle bank natl assn v lehman bros holdings inc  f supp d   d md  cases that apply to new york law bulova is inapposite in that case the defendant agreed to repair a roof for a period of twenty years thus the defendant was obligated to fix the roof each time during that twenty year period the roof springs a new leak in this case the mortgage representations are alleged to have been false when made those representations did not arise or change over time if the mortgage representations were false when made they are still false today if they were true when made they are still true today the repurchase obligation in this case is merely a remedy it is not a duty independent of the mortgage representation breach of contract claims the statute of limitations 0runs from the time of breach of the mortgage representations not from the time plaintiff elected to make demands for repurchase regarding the federal district court cases relied on by plaintiff those decisions misapply a decision of the united states court of appeals for the first circuit in resolution trust corp v key fin svs inc 0 fd   st cir  and are unpersuasive the first circuit case had nothing to do with the statute of limitationsand does not hold that a failure to repurchase on demand constitutes an independent breach of contract in new york a cause of action for breach of contract occurs when the party making the claim possesses a legal right to demand payment see hahn automotive warehouse inc v am zurich ins co  nyd   0 the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the first alleged breach evergreen  f supp d at  not from the time plaintiff chooses to seek a remedy to find otherwise would allow plaintiff to essentially circumvent the statute of limitations by indefinitely deferring its demand for payment id it appears that plaintiff may have had a viable cause of action as early as december   eg a claim for rescission see lana  edwards realty corp  ny misc lexis   because plaintiffs causes of action if any accrued no later than december   the closing date and the plaintiff with standing to sue appeared and filed its amended complaint on august  0 more than six years after plaintiffs claims for breach of contract accrued the complaint must be dismissed pursuant to cplr a for this reason the court need not decide whether the alleged misrepresentations were made for statute of limitations purposes as of december   when naac signed the mlpa and psa or as of december   accordingly it is hereby ordered that the motion to dismiss the compliant is granted in its entirety and the complaint is dismissed with costs and disbursements to defendant as taxed by the clerk upon the submission of an appropriate bill of costs and it is further ordered that the clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly this constitutes the decision and order of the court dated may 0 0e n t e r  o peter sherwood jsc footnotes footnote at the request of the court counsel for the parties provided a list of fourteen such cases involving statute of limitations issues currently pending in this court footnote this section is numbered xxxiv in the mlpa but should be numbered xxxix footnote although the psa and mlpa were signed by naac in whose shoes plaintiff stands as of december   plaintiff argues that the operative date is december   the closing date because psa §0bvii provides that the representations and warranties set forth in section  of the mlpa are true and correct as of the closing date the representations and warranties under § of the mlpa were made as of december   and as of the closing date and those under § were made as of the closing date footnote notably the court distinguished perry v village of arlington heights  fd  th cir  where the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that the district court properly dismissed the complaint in that case where plaintiff lacked standing at the time of commencement of the action before the period of limitations expired but thereafter gained standing after the statute of limitations had run in that case like this there was no valid preexisting action the court did declined to allow relationback rather it permitted plaintiff to bring a new claim based on allegations of events that happened within
