also lower leaving afterinflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns given this background of tepid global economic growth unconventional monetary policy measures and near fair market valuation we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 0 and beyond  checking up on your portfolio in terms of overall

what you make it’s what you keep” with top effective federal marginal rates at over 0 — net of certain phaseouts and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — taxefficient investing and taxloss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer minimize and offset income tax liabilities therefore consider the following think about placing taxinefficient asset classes and strategies in taxadvantaged accounts evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as etfs master limited partnerships reits common stocks and qualified preferred stocks as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year remember
