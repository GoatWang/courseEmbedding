reblogsharetweetsharelishui china feb   prnewswire  tantech holdings limited tanh tantech or the company a leading manufacturer of bamboobased charcoal products today announced that its chairman and chief executive officer mr wang zhengyu has issued the following special letter to shareholdersdear fellow shareholdersi am writing today to share the exciting progress at tantech holdings limited tanh and our plans for the upcoming yeartantech is successfully executing on its mission of contributing to a greener world through the development of cleaner energy sources our technology truly reaches across the spectrum by being able to do almost anything from replacing coal charcoals which are used in heaters and cookstoves with a cleaner energy approach that would consist of bamboo charcoal that is more sustainable to produce and burns significantly cleaner than traditional coalin addition we also produce carbon related products with absorption function for the usage of indoor and automobile interior all of these can reduce indoor air pollutionas you may recall tantech made its debut on the nasdaq under the symbol tanh in march  at that time over  of our sales were generated by a price insensitive and highly competitive global consumer base however due to managements efforts to improve the merchandise mix consumer sales accounted for less than  of our total revenues in the ensuing years now we are preparing to reap the benefits of our work over the next several yearsour key achievements includegrowth and diversification on january   we entered into a framework agreement to acquire suzhou e motors co ltd a specialty electric vehicles and power batteries manufacturer this potential acquisition is the first of many attractive ecofriendly assets that we will be acquiring we are currently looking into the purchase of a number of ecofriendly brands that are well established in nd and rd tier cities within china where pollution is more severe and where more opportunities lieinvesting in innovation continuous technological advantages and ongoing innovation is at the core of tantechs business strategy to this end we have doubled our rd spending from  in  to m in  in  we plan to further increase rd spending as economies of scale are expected to free up additional investment funds in addition to the continuing rd efforts in our consumer charcoal doctor products tantech will gradually move our rd focus to capacitors and batteries as well as special vehicle for sanitary use recently we received government funding in lieu of the green manufacturing technology of barbecue charcoalstreamline distribution channels previous distribution strategy involved negotiating directly with supermarkets which resulted in lower gross margins  to improve our bargaining powers in the market we have decided to restructure our distribution network in an effort to cut both overall time and costs relating to the sales cycle thereby positively impacting our gross marginscompany sees growth in our goal for  is to grow our client base and capture additional market share our business development efforts are focused on the following three primary areas barbecue charcoal bamboo charcoal products new energy vehiclesover the next few years the company expects to grow revenues on an annual basis while as we gain economies of scale our expenses will grow more modestly going forward operating profits are expected to grow substantially faster as the company expands its profitabilityaddressing share price volatilityas an emerging growth enterprise tantechs share price is often affected by macroeconomic forces that have little to no impact on our fundamental business for example the shares of many companies doing business in china have come under pressure as economic growth slows from the lowdouble digit range earlier in this decade to a range of  industrial and infrastructure companies in particular have been hard hit by these changes however tantechs industrial business revenues grew  from  to  and revenue slowed in  a more recent development is investor concern over the intermediate term prospects for clean and alternative energy companies as low oil prices make alternative fuel sources less economically attractive and as the trump administration seeks to cut support and regulation supporting the development of clean alternative energy in the ustelling the story to the investor communityfinally a few words about our investor outreach efforts  as noted the past two years have been about establishing and positioning the business for sustainable growth  we understand the importance of building and maintaining trust with the investment community and purposefully waited until the pieces were in place to bring our story to the markets we believe we have reached that juncture in the next stage of our business plan and accordingly will be significantly increasing our shareholder communications efforts this year to ensure our progress and key achievements are effectively communicated to both existing as well as new potential investors i personally believe the latest series of developments will make our growth prospects more clear and should make the investing public stand up and take notice of tantech holdings and its investment meritskind regardsswang zhengyu chairman and chief executive

series of measures to lay a solid ground for future development said mr wang zhengyu chairman and chief executive officer of tantech first we have gradually increased the share of wholesalers in our distribution network while reducing the share of supermarkets to improve our bargaining power before the company mainly sold its products through supermarkets and the high reliance on supermarkets undermined our bargaining power second china has shut down a large number of small manufacturers of charcoal kilns in recent years amid its fight against air pollution the massive closure has had a negative impact on our upstream suppliers to fend off the impact the company has been exploring a variety of ways to ensure the supply of raw materials finally the company is working closely with suzhou e –motors towards completion of the transaction however the delay in ownership transfer has slowed our acquisition of suzhou emotors looking ahead mr wang said in the future the company will continue to reduce the share of supermarkets in our distribution network and increase the share of wholesalers in particular we will ramp up marketing efforts in third and fourthtier small chinese cities meanwhile we will quicken the buildup of ecommerce platform to improve the companys brand image just weeks ago the company released upgraded bamboo charcoal bedding articles which have stronger absorption capacities compared to the predecessors in the future we will keep spending on research to develop more highvalue added products in addition we will seek opportunities to cooperate with
