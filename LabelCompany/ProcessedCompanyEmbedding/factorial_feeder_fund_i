permutationsnext tutorialcombinationstagspermutations mathvideo transcriptif youve been paying particularly close attention to our use of the factorial operator and videos on permutations and combinations you may or may not have noticed something that might be interesting so lets just review factorial a little bit so if i were to say n factorial that of course is going to be n times n minus one times n minus two and i would just keep going down until i go to times one so id keep decrementing n until i get to one and then i would multiply all of those things together so for example if i were to say three factorial thats going to be three times two times one if i were to say two factorial thats going to be two times one one factorial well i just keep decrementing until i get to one but i dont even have to decrement here im already at one so i just multiply one now what about zero factorial this is interesting zero factorial so one logical thing is to say oh hey you know maybe zero factorial is zero im just starting with itself its already below one and maybe it is zero now what we will see is that this is not the case that mathematics and mathematicians have decided remember this is whats interesting that the factorial operation is something that humans have invented that they think its just an interesting thing its a useful notation so they can define what it does and mathematicians have found it far more useful to define zero factorial as something else to define zero factorial as  and theres a little drum roll here they believe zero factorial should be one and i know based on the reasoning the conceptional reasoning of this this doesnt make any sense but since weve already been exposed to a little bit to permutation ill show you why this is a useful concept especially in the world of permutations and combinations which is frankly where factorial shows up the most most of the cases that ive ever seen factorial in anything has been in situations of combinations  permutations and in a few other things but mainly permutations and combinations so lets review a little bit weve said if we have n things and we want to figure out the number of ways to permute them into k spaces its going to be n factorial over n minus k factorial now weve also said that if we had n things that we wanna permute into n places well this really should just be n factorial the first place has  lets do this so this is the first place this is the second place this is the third place all the way you get to the nth place well there would be n possibilities for whos in the first position or which object is in the first position and for each of those possibilities there would be n minus one possibilities for which object you choose to put in the second position because weve already put one into that position now for each of these n times n minus one possibilities where youve placed two things there would be n minus two possibilities of what goes in the third position and then you would just go all the way down to one this thing right over here is exactly what we wrote over here this is equal to n factorial but if we directly apply this formula this would need to be n factorial over n minus n factorial and then you might see why this is interesting because this is going to be n factorial over zero factorial so in order for this formula to apply even in the case where k is equal to n which is this one right over here and for that to be consistent with just plain old logic zero factorial needs to be equal to one and so the mathematics community has decided hey this thing weve constructed called factorial you know we set an exclamation mark behind something and in all of our heads we say that you kind of count down that number all the way to one and you keep multiplying them for zero were just gonna define this make a mathematical definition were just gonna say zero factorial is equal to one and its actually quite

this is another chair and that is another chair we can number the chairs that is chair one that is chair two and that is chair three now lets assume that there are three people who want to sit in these three chairs so there is person a there is person b and there is person c what we want to do is we want to count the number of ways that these three people can sit in these three chairs what do i mean by that well if a sits in chair one b sits in chair three and c sits in chair two that is one scenario right over there so this is one of the possible scenarios a in seat one c in seat two b in seat three another scenario could be b in seat one maybe c still sits in seat two c still sits there and now a would be in seat three so this is one scenario and two scenarios my question to you is how many scenarios are there like this i encourage you to pause the video and try to think through it im assuming youve had a go at it now lets work through it together i want to do it very systematically so that we dont forget any of the scenarios the way im going to do it is im going to create three blanks that represent each of the chairs so here its in a circle but we could just say that blank is chair one thats the blank for chair two and that is the blank for chair three im going to start with seat one and im going to say well what are the different scenarios a could sit there b could sit there c could sit there then for each of those figure out who could sit in seat two and then for each of those figure out who could sit in seat three so lets do that first what are the scenarios of who could sit in seat one maybe ill write it this way maybe ill do seat one so right now were only going to fill seat one well a could sit in seat one in which case we havent filled seat two or seat three yet so thats two or three b could sit in seat one and we havent figured out who sits in seat two or seat three yet then we could have c sitting in seat one and we still have to figure out whos going to sit in seat two and seat three for each of these lets figure out who could be sitting in seat two so seats one and two for this one right over here we have a in seat one for sure we could either have b sitting in seat two in which case ill leave this blank although you can use a little bit of deductive reasoning to figure out whos going to be sitting in seat three so ill leave seat three blank or you could have c sitting in seat two we still havent figured out whos sitting in seat three although once again a little bit of deductive reasoning might tell us so these are the scenarios where a is in seat one now what about when b is in seat one we could put a in seat two and we still need to figure out whos in seat three or we could put c in seat two and we still need to figure out whos going to be in seat three finally lets look at c where c is in seat one you could either put a in seat two or you could put b in seat two now lets fill out all three of the seats so seats one two and three for this scenario right over here theres only one option that you could put in seat three the only person who hasnt sat down yet is person c so this will be a b c and what would this be the only person who hasnt sat down in this scenario yet to fill this chair the only option for this chair theres only one option here its going to be person b its a c b this one is going to be b a c cs the only person who could sit there a is the only person who could sit there b c a and then here b is the only person who could sit in seat three and here a is the only person who could sit in seat three how many scenarios do we have we have one two three four five and six and six is our answer thats the number of scenarios that you could have the different people sitting in the different chairs now i know what youre thinking okay sal this was a scenario with three people and three chairs and i mightve been able just do this even if i didnt do it systematically but what if i have many many more chairs what if i had  chairs well the number of scenarios would get fairly large what if i had five people and five chairs even this method right over here would take up a lot of paper space or a lot of screen space what do we do in that scenario and the realization here is just thinking about what happened here how many people could sit in seat one if were going seat by seat how many possibilities were there to put in seat one if youre seating in order if you havent filled any of the seats yet right at the beginning theres three possible people who could sit in seat one you see it right over here one two three because theres three possible people for each of those how many people could sit in seat two for each of them lets say the scenario where a is sitting in seat one theres two possibilities for who could sit in seat two let me do this in a different color so this right over here for each of these three theres two possibilities of who could sit in seat two if a is sitting in seat one you could have either b or c in seat two if b is sitting in seat one you have either a or c for seat two so for each of these three you have two possibilities of who could sit in seat two so you have six possibilities where youre filling in three times two or youre filling in the scenarios for seats one and two and then for each of those how many scenarios are who can sit in seat three for each of those there was only one possibility for who could sit in seat three we see it right there thats because theres only one person left who hasnt sat down yet so how many total possibilities are there well three times two times one is equal to six and so if we were to do that same exact thought exercise with say five seats lets go through that exercise its interesting so if we have one two three four five so this is five seats with five people sitting down and we want to figure out how many scenarios are there for all the different people and all the different seats for the first seat theres five different people who could sit in it for each of those scenarios theres four people who havent sat down yet who could sit in the second seat for each of those scenarios theres going to be three people who havent sat down yet so those are the people who could sit in the third seat if were filling out the seats in this order for each of all of these scenarios theres two people left who havent sat down yet who could sit in the fourth seat and then for all of these scenarios theres only one person left who hasnt sat down who would have to sit in the fifth seat if you had this exact same thing but instead of three chairs you had five chairs the number of scenarios would be five times four times three times two times one which is what  times six which is equal to  scenarios and so you see that the scenarios grow fairly quickly and if youre wondering hey this is kind of a neat mathematical thing three times two times one or five times four times three times two times one if you start with a number and you multiply that number times number one less than that all the way down to getting to one that seems like neat kind of fun mathematical operation and lucky for you or maybe unlucky for you because this might have been your chance at fame this operation has already been defined its called the factorial operation so this thing right over here this is the same thing as three factorial you write this little exclamation mark this right over here this is the same thing as five factorial in general if i said six factorial that would be equal to six times five times four times three times two times one hopefully you enjoyed thatpermutation formulaup nextpermutation formula
