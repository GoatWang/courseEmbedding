queries such as “who is putin” or “how do you make a moscow mule” studies of the site’s accuracy over the years have yielded surprisingly good results in many ways wikipedia represents the utopian ideals of the early internet as conceived by the researchers and academics who created it a vast database of knowledge available to all humanity for free forever for millennia encyclopedias have been a hallmark of civilization from the enormous four great books of song of thcentury china to the crowning intellectual achievement of the enlightenment era the humanist encyclopédie banned by monarchs across europe it is the original cloud or as wikimedia’s “vision statement” puts it “imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge that’s our commitment” but as the web has spread around the globe becoming an engine of commerce more than an academic or literary paradise the place of a free website run by a nonprofit and largely curated by a handful of volunteers is far from certain indeed the future of wikipedia has increasingly come into doubt over the past few years some observers question how long the website can stay relevant behemoths like google and facebook—the first and second largest websites respectively—have billions of dollars at their disposal to pursue lofty goals like cataloguing the sum of knowledge or connecting every human being to the internet by contrast tretikov heads a nonprofit with a relatively meager annual budget of  million that comes almost entirely from donations a team of about  fulltime employees headquartered in san francisco oversees the work of roughly  active volunteer editors who seem to have divergent views about almost everything from proper punctuation to the role that the foundation should play in the operation of the site “i do not envy lila tretikov’s position” says william beutler a wikipedia editor since  and author of the wikipedian a blog that reports on the goingson of the website and its army of editors lack of resources is not wikipedia’s only challenge it also struggles from demographics that undermine its central mission the makeup of its editing community is largely white and male women comprise an estimated  of editors that has led to critical gaps in coverage about topics ranging from women’s health to the history of botswana compared to say the history of montana meanwhile the total number of people regularly making edits has shrunk active englishlanguage editors have fallen by  since  though the figure ticked up slightly last year tretikov says the growing numbers of internet users around the world will provide new editors to help fill subject gaps but if that doesn’t happen one of the web’s greatest institutions could start to crumble tretikov who describes herself as a “classic geek” was born in  in moscow she grew up in the waning days of the soviet union when free and open information was in short supply she recalls her father then a professor at moscow state and her mother a filmmaker cautioning her not to repeat their kitchen conversations in grade school tretikov palpably remembers the liberating effect of the government’s glasnost policy in the late s like when her mother burst into tears hearing the previously proscribed music of vladimir vysotsky on tv “i grew up with these ideals of freedom of speech and the sense of how precious and incredibly vulnerable that is” she says in her accented but fluent english three years after the soviet union collapsed at age  she left for the united states by herself to live with an uncle who had fled years earlier she attended the university of california berkeley where she studied a subcategory of artificial intelligence she left in her final months without a degree to join sun microsystems in  before eventually becoming a major figure in the opensourced software movement of the s around the same time jimmy wales and larry sanger cofounded wikipedia as a side project to nupedia an online encyclopedia they planned to fill with peerreviewed content written by experts the wiki version—“wiki” means “quick” in hawaiian and was an early term used to describe collaborative online content—allowed for anyone regardless of background to create a new page or make an edit to existing articles it took off and by the end of the year had nearly  articles in  languages in  wales or “jimbo” as he’s known in the community created the nonprofit wikimedia foundation to fund and operate the servers behind wikipedia while leaving control over content in the hands of the growing editing community today there are roughly  edits a second on wikipedia and sister projects like wikimedia commons a database of free media like photos tretikov with a mix of technical experience and a track record in the opensource software community was recruited by sue gardner a former journalist who had overseen the foundation’s rapid growth since  when she joined the wikimedia foundation in may she found it had ballooned but its technological efforts had been lackluster and a  attempt to create a new simplified interface for editing articles had prompted a backlash from members who found it buggy and oversimplified ultimately the “upgrade” was reversed by an editor “it’s definitely a very long thoughtabout and longdesired shift in the focus of the organization towards product and tech” says wales now a member of the board of trustees that works with the foundation and helped select tretikov “we’re a funny organization because in some ways you can think of us as a cultural institution and a nonprofit organization but at the same time we run this massive website” the tensions can sometimes resemble those that roil political parties in transition it can be an inhospitable place for new editors a neophyte editor who hits “edit” on an article will be presented with text that looks more like code than prose if she still manages to make her edit she then faces the high likelihood that her change will be reverted back by a cadre of veteran editors policing for socalled “vandalism” but also for edits that don’t align with the community’s extensive set of norms finally if she continues to edit and even participates in discussions she will often encounter raucous maledominated debates jerome hergueux an affiliate researcher at harvard’s berkman center for internet and society who studies collaborative production models like wikipedia says that in  only about  of the  accounts created on english wikipedia each month made more than  edits in their first month of that  roughly a tenth were still editing the following year “it’s a social engineering problem” hergueux says these problems may be symptomatic of wikipedia’s quasipublic state of being but new ones have arisen search engines that pull content from wikipedia pages to post with search results highlight wikipedia’s value for example but they also divert users from actually going to wikipedia that harms the site because while people consume the information they’re less likely to become part of the community and start editing the global shift toward mobile internet traffic has also made it more difficult to add new edits to the site because potential editors have so far been reluctant to make changes from their phones or tablets for now it’s not clear that the decline in editors has reduced the quality of its content but observers say wikipedia could still see a sudden drop off like when the italianlanguage version saw its number of active editors fall by nearly  over  months in  that’s one scenario “the other one which is scarier is the prospect of a slow long drawnout decline that is almost imperceptible” says andrew lih a professor of journalism at american university and the author of the  book the wikipedia revolution “it’s kind of like the boiling frogs scenario” he adds to fight back tretikov is focusing the foundation’s limited resources on how readers and editors use the site she prioritized efforts to gather data on what users like and don’t and plans to add some  new engineers the moves have brought the organization more in line with how its private sector peers in silicon valley operate “i’m focusing a lot on our product direction on our technical capacity to do things and how we establish what we need to be doing next” she says the team has rolled out and updated sleek new ios and android apps and streamlined the editing process on mobile since last july a fifth of firsttime edits on wikimedia sites have been on mobile tretikov is also moving to fill in gaps in content last month the foundation launched the “inspire campaign” to elicit proposals for boosting gender diversity pledging  to fund some of the ideas since she joined it has expanded its wikipedia zero program which partners with wireless carriers to provide free mobile access to wikipedia to an additional  countries including burma ghana and morocco tretikov hopes this will lead to an influx of new more diverse readers and ultimately editors the foundation is working on an automatic translation tool to let users to create new articles based on existing pages in other languages then there are the legions of editors who are necessary for the site’s continued vitality but also can be a bane for the foundation to deal with in one particularly caustic case in august she drew the wrath of some editors when her team rolled out the media viewer which displays thumbnail images in larger size without providing full details about the image critics of the change particularly vocal editors of the german wikipedia were incensed when the foundation blocked any editor from turning back the change “i want victory over the wmf” said one commentator on german wikipedia using the foundation’s acronym “i want the wmf to shudder when they remember this case” the foundation lifted the restriction on changes but the media viewer is still the default image viewer on wikipedia “it’s not realistic to have everybody always in the boat with you” tretikov says beutler puts the issue less diplomatically “the wikipedia community is full of old timers who are used to getting their way and don’t like things changing and i think it’s important that the community always be forced to rethink is wikipedia everything that it can be right now” tretikov says she is committed to trying to get it there “wikipedia was revolutionary because it just changed how an encyclopedia is created and shared” she says “it was fantastic and we’ve done an incredible job but for the next roughly half of the population the story is going to be very different” your browser is out of date please update your browser at

share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close jemima kiss and samuel gibbs wednesday  august   edt last modified on tuesday  february   est lila tretikov was still a child when the soviet union began to embrace glasnost in the s the new freedoms enabled tretikov an academically brilliant student to move from moscow to new york by herself waitressing to learn english and pay for her last year of high school by the end of the year she was top of her shakespeare class tretikov has since spent  years studying computer science and working with collaborative “open source” software – and in may beat  candidates to the job of executive director of the world’s fifth largest website wikipedia for tretikov there are parallels between glasnost and wikipedia’s own aspirations of transparency and openness “glasnost was a phenomenal renaissance period in the history of russia and taught me much about importance of freedom of information” tretikov told the guardian in her first interview “the only real way to improve conditions of civilisations is to provide open access to information for education and culture and to be honest about the past otherwise we spend our lives siloed from each other and we repeat the mistakes of our grandparents” tretikov’s academic work on machine learning got her a job at sun microsystems in  and she founded her own marketing technology firm grokdigital the following year it was when she joined silicon valley’s sugarcrm which offers customer management software for businesses that she was able to expand her interest in open source software where the source code is published shared and improved with the developer community speaking in soft heavily accented american tretikov  is ambitious about wikipedia’s future yet her appointment was controversial among some of wikipedia’s notoriously boisterous community of volunteer editors the community includes a hardcore of around  volunteers who have all made at least  individual edits  when tretikov admitted in a post that she had only just made her first edit on the english wikipedia site there was an inevitable backlash even though she explained that she had done so to understand the difficulties of firsttime editors “we ended up with an amateur and that’s pretty frightening” wrote veteran editor pete forsyth in a leaked email “if she’s got no keel on the open sea who knows where her take on the community will wash up it doesn’t give me a lot of hope that she can chart a better course through the crippling dynamics of the last couple years” wikimedia’s general counsel geoff brigham chief executive lila tretikov and wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales attend a press conference in central london on  august ahead of the wikimania conference photograph carl courtafpgetty images others were offended that her boyfriend developer wil sinclair had joined a site that scrutinises wikipedia and its editors describing sinclair as “her uninvited plus one” it prompted a characteristically rational response from tretikov “i make my decisions using my own professional judgement” she wrote at the time “i don’t consult wil on wikipedian matters ask him to do anything on my behalf or monitor his engagements with the community … we have always both been extremely independent” there is often tension between volunteers and management in wikipedia a men’s rights group claimed a “feminist conspiracy” was censoring its views on the site it is a challenge for tretikov to gain the confidence of its maledominated volunteers many of whom have worked on the site for years to establish its processes and norms while at the same time making the site more appealing and accessible to new more diverse editors diversity is a big problem with wikipedia dominated by white western men thirteen years since it launched the site publishes and maintains more than m articles in  languages all run through a complex and often exhaustingly democratic system of voting and consensus but women are estimated to account for only  of the  regular editors and volunteers in the developing world are also underrepresented “the most important thing for us is to lower the barrier to entry to this knowledgebuilding community” she says “our mission is to educate so the more open we can be to different types of thinking the more diverse we will be” as the only noncommercial site of its scale wikipedia is an anomaly among the household names of the web it remains a uniquely complex organisation and tretikov will have to help sustain its finances the site costs m £m a year to run and relies on charitable grants and donations from users which increased from m to m under tretikov’s predecessor sue gardner if it chose to display adverts to nearly half a billion people that use the site each month – as some commentators have pushed for – it could make nearly bn per year by one estimate “knowledge is all about trust” says tretikov “not being beholden to demands of the market gives us freedom to do the right thing for the user first and foremost it allows us to be much more focused on the users and what their needs are” facebook twitter pinterest a very early wikipedia homepage from  as the largest single source of free information in the world wikipedia also has to battle misinformation by corporations and governments and is already being defended by some automated software or ‘bots’ that publish a twitter notification when articles relating to congress parliament or other public bodies have been edited by an insider recent efforts have started to overhaul the site’s editing system to make it easier and less technically demanding for new editors but automated software could help here too the english language wikipedia already has nearly  approved bots and across the whole wikipedia networks bots accounted for  of wikipedia’s bn page views during july  these programmes perform an array of mundane tasks from correcting spelling to updating standard census statistics and even reversing vandalism “in the future an editor without coding skills will have access to tools that could allow him or her to automatically scan identify and fill gaps in the knowledge with a few clicks of a button” she says “programmers are thinking about how we can augment and improve what humans do by handing off the grunt work to the machines  enabling us to focus on the creative ingenious tasks our biggest challenge is to understand how things are changing in the way humans experience technology and be there for those that aren’t even online yet” tretikov said she recognised concern about the increasing use of machines to automate human tasks “but computers are definitely much better than humans at processing large amounts of information which is why that’s where we use them most there are emerging areas where bots could help us identify interesting things – that doesn’t make computers creative in and of themselves but they do help us amplify our own creativity” given the site’s experiments with automation and tretikov’s academic interest in artificial intelligence she has coauthored several patents it is no surprise that her vision for wikipedia is to assert itself as a technology company rather than a media firm her first real test will come on saturday when she stands before the realworld congregation of wikipedia to set out her plans for its future “the only thing we can do to change things is to charge ahead and change things through actions through trying who knows in  years we could be trying to help men change the status quo of the world where women have been proven the capable ones” wikipedia in numbers number of articlesoverall there are  articles on wikipedia but in the englishlanguage
