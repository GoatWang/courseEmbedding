portfolios key points if an investment professional is making frequent decisions to buy and sell certain investments on your behalf then your portfolio is being actively managed passively managed portfolios on the other hand typically track an index your investment goals and risk tolerance may dictate the best approach for your portfolio basically “actively managed” means that your money is being handled by a professional money manager comanagers or a team of managers who are making decisions on what investments to buy hold and sell managers use a variety of tools including wall street research forecasts and their own judgment to make these decisions this is different from passive investing that usually refers to investments that follow a particular market index or group of indices some investing companies take active management a step further and create a special diversified product with an eye toward asset allocation and specific investing goals these managers choose a group of mutual funds andor exchange traded funds in a variety of asset classes such as stocks bonds international securities and real estate to create the asset allocation that is tailored toward a particular individual’s needs and goals advantages and disadvantages of actively managed portfolios active management can give you access to investment professionals who often strive to manage risk and limit portfolio volatility with the goal of delivering a more consistent return over time they may also rebalance the portfolio on a regular basis to help stay in line with the original investing goals as with any investment there are risks from market and economic volatility as well as other factors that may be difficult to predict but many actively managed portfolios use a diverse mix of investments and asset classes that together help manage risk when one sector of the portfolio is lagging others may be thriving professional managers are also often able to move in and out of risky or overly volatile sectors far more easily than individual investors is an actively managed portfolio right for you if you’re focused on generating income in your portfolio protecting your assets and creating enough growth to see you through  or more years of retirement then an actively managed portfolio may be a good option for you many active managers focus on providing growth and income while managing risk but before you choose active management for your portfolio make sure this investment strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance ask your advisor for more information about actively managed portfolios find answers to your retirement questions take the minute confident retirement® check related information assess your risk tolerance asset allocation and diversification

more schwab managed portfolios ™  how do we manage risk managing risk is about more than timing moves in and out of the market  at charles schwab investment advisory inc csia we believe that risk management begins with asset allocation  transcript jim peterson at charles schwab investment advisory managing risk is not just about making big timing moves in and out of the market in fact timing like that can add risk to a portfolio not lessen it    risk management in our portfolios begins with asset allocation  that is how we spread the portfolio across different types of investments and around the globe and we build that asset allocation for todays world not the markets of the s or early s we do this by investing in us stocks and bonds as well as international stocks and bonds we invest in real assets such as gold industrial metals and us as well as international real estate each of these investments is designed to tap into a specific source of risk or return the reason we use these broad groups of investments is because the risk in more traditional investment strategies tends to be driven almost entirely by equity risk  that is the risk is coming from the stock portion of the portfolio so even in a traditional balanced portfolio of  stocks and  bonds we have found that up to  of the risk  or  of variability in returns  comes from traditional stocks this factor alone can cause a pretty rocky ride for investors that we seek to smooth out so when we build a balanced portfolio today we use an expanded set of investments that give investors exposure to multiple sources of risk and return this is key and to us the most important factor when it comes to managing risk what do i receive if schwab managed portfolios are right for meevery schwab managed portfolios
