a uk packaging inventor could make millions of pounds in royalties after signing an exclusive licensing arrangement with a leading but undisclosed japanese packaging manufacturer mark sheahan based in brockley south london confirmed the deal on  january after  months of negotiations over his patented squeezeopen easyopen and closure plastics technology see box the deal includes a large signing fee for sheahan�s firm compgen ltd with many possible applications identified within the cosmetics and toiletries healthcare and food sectors royalty earnings could run to millions of pounds when products are eventually rolled out  meanwhile usbased silgan corporation has renewed its own fiveyear old nonexclusive licensing agreement across many different application markets however the system is still to breakthrough big in the uk sheahan listed at number  in last year�s packaging news power  packaging news has spent years and more than �lm in the uk largely without success in trying to convince the domestic packaging industry and brand owners of the potential of his closure  this is despite the fact that he has picked up more than  topline awards worldwide sheahan said �when it comes to innovation uk manufacturers might talk a good talk but either they�re nervous about taking a new step to achieve differentiation or else prone to a �not invented here� mentality  in the latter case that�s proving rather ironic as things are turning out�   the patented squeezeopen first conceived to aid easier pack opening and closure among the manually impaired comprises of a lid that snapfits onto the base of any container with only a light one handed squeeze on the side of the lid needed to open the pack the only squeezeopen packaging applications made in the uk so far have been for the south african �squidgeme� aroma dough retail product and for a range of promotional items with the british library   plastic  rubber weekly front page compgen ltd managing director mark sheahan was crowned innovator of the year at the london innovation awards  the companys  squeezeopen� petpp packaging closure also won the visteon sponsored award for manufacturing innovation and the premier award for innovation  the closure was designed to make opening containers easy and help prevent some of the  packaging related accidents a year that require hospital treatment page two  in the rapidly growing plastics packaging sector it is refreshing to see a new and innovative design spring open in the marketplace  mark sheahan of compgen ltd has invented a container that is opened by squeezing the lid which in turn pops off with little effort  still in sample format the containers are aimed at most markets from shoe creams to snack food  compgens easy open closure manufactured in pp and pet but available in a range of materials is pleasingly tactile  which may have contributed to its winning the best innovation award at the package business convention at the nec prw cartoon    home
