wood corner desk in natural cherry     i recently purchased this corner desk from cymax and was quite surprized to find the price was more than half of what other reta ilers online were listing it for when it arrived right on time as promised i soon found out that it was very well packaged and all of the parts inside the box where protected from damaged during shipment after following the simple assembly instructions i found it rather easy to assemble it was the perfect size for my personal use and matched the rest of my office furniture it did have some minor scratches on the underside but were unseen after assembled i have only one minor thing that i did not like it did not have a slide out keyboard tray however for me i was able to transfer the one from my old desk to make it fit on this one after set up i found that the desk was quite heavy and weights about  pounds iam quite sure that it is sturdy enough to hold up to  pounds as the instructions stayed i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a corner desk for their home office or place of business i can now sit at my desk and enjoy the window view as well for me this was the right desk at a great price   hide

archivegeorge bush confronts a rumorby paula chinposted on august   at pm edt sharetweetemail when the republican convention opens for business this week in houston the program promises a climactic madefortv moment as barbara bush addresses the gop faithful in prime time her subject is scheduled to be that totem of the republican campaign—family values—delivered as she is surrounded on the dais by her brood of five children and  grandchildren now on the eve of this carefully choreographed event the long laboo question of an alleged first mistress has reared its ugly head a frontpage story in the sensationalist tabloid the new york post reported that a new book quotes former us ambassador louis fields as saying that he arranged for then vice president george bush and his former appointments secretary jennifer fitzgerald to share a private cottage during an official visit to geneva in  “it became clear they were romantically involved” said fields according to the power house a book about influence peddling in the capital written by former congressional aide susan b trento the ambassador who retired in  and died of cancer in  was said to have told at least three people that the rendezvous took place when barbara bush was out promoting her book about c fred the family dog fields said the rendezvous which had the couple “staying in adjoining bedrooms” was “so heavyhanded” that it made him “very uncomfortable” trento says that fields a us ambassador to the geneva nucleardisarmament talks revealed details of the alleged bushfitzgerald rendezvous to her husband former cnn investigative reporter joseph trento in  joseph trento said he never reported the story because fields was fearful of jeopardizing his career and refused to go on record when the story broke last week fitzgerald now  and deputy chief of protocol in the state department was said to be out of the country on business and unreachable for comment not so president bush who responded sharply when a cnn reporter broached the topic at a news conference in kennebunkport “”i’m not going to take any sleazy questions like that” bush bristled “i’m not going to respond other than to say it’s a lie” fitzgerald’s mother yearold frances pattesonknight of mclean va also denied the reports which she says have “devastated jennifer “she had a very unhappy marriage and she can’t stand men” says pattesonknighl who recalls her daughter once telling her “i’ve been through so much i couldn’t have sex with anybody” the public facts of fitzgerald’s life are sketchy her mother who came from a prominent boston family married brig douglas henry pattesonknight an english military officer their britishborn daughter attended private schools in virginia and later mount vernon college in  she married us army pvt gerald fitzgerald but they separated the following year and divorced in  she subsequently dropped the capitalization of the g in her name fitzgerald she later worked for bush’s close friend and political mentor former federal communications commission chairman dean burch in  she was appointed bush’s personal assistant after he was named us envoy to beijing it was then rumors say that the alleged affair began when bush returned in  to head the cia fitzgerald came along as his aide with the exception of a year in england at the us embassy she stayed by the vice presidentsidetechnically as his appointments assistant but in reality as an allpowerful gatekeeper colleagues say she has an extremely tough office style and a fondness for shopping when fitzgerald was transferred from the white house to become bush’s liaison to the senate in  rumors circulated that it was because their relationship had become a liability to bush after bush became president fitzgerald was named to her present job at the state department gossip surfaced again during the  campaign when the alternative la weekly ran a story naming fitzgerald as bush’s longtime mistress and quoting an unnamed source that fitzgerald had spoken openly of the affair last may hilary clinton fuming over stories about her husband’s alleged affair with gennifer flowers complained in vanity fair that everyone knew there was another “jennifer”—in bush’s life—but that no one was reporting it it is true that the controversy surrounding fitzgerald has not been widely covered nonetheless her name is well known to influential people in the capital and fitzgerald’s runin with us customs was a hot topic in  fitzgerald was fined  for underestimating by  the value of a nutrialined raincoat and a silverfox cape that she purchased for  in argentina the longterm political significance of last week’s accusation was unclear most washington analysts agreed that bush’s denial would quell the gossip bill clinton for one wasn’t gloating over george bush’s distress “i didn’t like it when it was done to me” he said “and i don’t like it when it’s done to him” paula chin charlotte hayes in washington

paula mcmahoncontact reportersun sentinel munchausen by proxy jennifer bush says her mom kathy bush never abused herprivacy policy it was a heartbreaking case that ripped a yearold girl from her south florida family and sent her mother to prison for yearsexactly  years ago today jennifer bush was placed in state care amid allegations that her mother kathy bush was deliberately making her ill in an unusual — and some say now discredited — form of child abuse called munchausen syndrome by proxyafter shunning attention for years jennifer bush is publicly defending her mom for the first time and agreed to release a written statement this week and answer a few limited followup questions from the sun sentinel jennifer made it very clear she thinks her mother never abused her said fort lauderdale lawyer robert buschel who defended kathy bush in her criminal trial and is the representative jennifer bush picked to relay her response to questionsthe coral springs familys story fascinated and polarized the community for years generated dozens of headlines internationally and featured on national tvmany thought the little girl was secretly abused by a mother who caused her to undergo dozens of unnecessary medical procedures and surgeries others believed it was a clear case of government overreach by state child welfare workers who split the family and prosecutors who filed criminal charges sun sentinelfamily photo provided by jennifer bush jennifer bush now  and her mom kathy bush photographed together in  they have been reunited for years and jennifer says she does not believe her mother abused her jennifer bush now  and her mom kathy bush photographed together in  they have been reunited for years and jennifer says she does not believe her mother abused her sun sentinelfamily photo provided by jennifer bush jennifer bush never appeared in court never testified against her mom and never publicly discussed the case authorities kept her out of view and out of state for years while she moved between foster homes and shelter care when she was old enough she made it clear she did not want to be in the spotlightnow  she is happily married and has fully reunited with her parents kathy and craig bush who live in georgia and her brothers matthew and jason she still fiercely protects her privacy and does not want to reveal where she lives despite all the public speculation about the case and her mother jennifer bush thinks it is so obvious that her mother did not abuse her that she included no reference to it in her initial prepared written statement she only made it clear she believes her mother is innocent when the sun sentinel asked the question paula mcmahon paula mcmahon bush wrote that april   changed her life foreverthat was the day that i was taken from my home and my family but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be the  years i spent in foster care were traumatic and i had some devastating things happen to me however i persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times these people helped shaped the woman i have become today she wrotetoday i can proudly say my family is extremely close knit we have flourished despite the devastating separation the bond i had with my brothers prior to being removed from my family is something that never changed my relationship with them helped carry me through my years in foster care my parents and i have picked up from where we left off and have a very close and loving relationshipbushs time in foster care was difficult but inspired her to try to fix the systems problems herself she became a social worker and says she hopes to become a foster parent herself soontoday i am living my dream as a social worker and changing the lives of the children and families i am working with today i am married to my high school sweetheart who has walked along side me for the past  years i get a lot of joy making memories with my family and making a difference in my community although this isnt always a happy anniversary it is a day to celebrate my family and who we are todaykathy bush who prosecutors argued was motivated by a desire to seek attention and publicity for herself by making her daughter ill sent a onesentence reply to an email requesting comment from her and craig we are very proud of jennifer and our sons they have all grown up to be fine adults and dedicated their lives to serving othersshe declined further comment the couples sons both worked as firefighters and jason bush served in the us marine corps and was stationed in iraq during the warbuschel the lawyer said he thinks munchausen syndrome by proxy was a flawed diagnosis du jour that has mostly fallen out of favor with medical experts he said he has since represented other families who faced similar allegations but persuaded investigators that no crimes were committedits nice to see the government didnt succeed in destroying this family buschel said its just good to see that jennifer took her ordeal — of being separated from her family — and she really turned it around so that now shes helping other kids and parentsthe bush familys ordeal began early in jennifers life when she appeared to be chronically ill with digestive problems seizures and a host of related illnessesbefore the abuse allegation surfaced the little girl sometimes dressed in a ballet tutu or baseball fan gear and her mom were featured in newspaper articles about her illnessthey organized fundraisers to help pay her massive medical bills were feted by sports stars and even visited the clinton white house where they were invited to raise awareness about health care costsin april  police and child welfare investigators began looking into a complaint made by a health care worker who suspected kathy bush might be intentionally causing her daughter to become ill by secretly giving her extra doses of medicine infecting her and interfering with her treatmentin her first eight years jennifer had spent  days in hospitals and underwent  medical procedures and  nonsurgical treatments investigators saidauthorities arrested kathy bush on abuse charges after a year of investigating the same day child welfare workers took jennifer from her elementary school into state care authorities said her health improved immediately the family said shed been getting better for some time before she was taken awayjennifer bush moved between several state shelter care homes and foster homes during the next several years while her mother battled criminal charges through it all bushs husband and their two sons managed to maintain their support for both kathy and jennifer never wavering in their belief that kathy was innocent and both needed to come home after a long arduous trial in broward circuit court in  jurors found kathy bush guilty of aggravated child abuse the judge only allowed fleeting references to munchausen in the trial and jurors said they gave it little attention but believed bush had harmed the girl bush was later sentenced to five years in state prison she appealed but lost she was released in june  after serving more than three years of her sentence when state authorities moved to terminate her and her husbands parental rights to jennifer bush initially fought but reached a settlement that cut her rights to the child but allowed her husband and sons to continue visiting jennifercourts barred kathy bush from seeing jennifer for about six years starting in  but they began writing letters supervised by a therapist in  and jennifer asked to be allowed to resume seeing her mother in  when she turned broward prosecutors did not oppose her wishes and said they believed they had protected her until she was old enough to make her own choicesas jennifer bush moves on with the happier phase of her life she offered words of encouragement to other foster children who
