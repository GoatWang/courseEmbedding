angeles today nov  hollywood executives in attendance included representatives from caa and netflix and officials from the chinese consulate general the two companies describe the agreement as “strategic” it spans development investment production promotion and marketing of film and tv projects additionally the two aim to establish a multimedia video production base an online platform for

investment management the fund’s objective is to invest in the development of chinaus film projects through purchase of ip and script rights screenplay development and down payments for major cast members “the investment evaluation criteria of the chinaus film coproduction project development fund are that the film coproduction projects must first conform to china’s relevant national policies the coproduced films can be released in cinemas in the us and worldwide and can also be distributed digitally” sun said “the projects should to the maximum extent give considerations to cinema distribution digital distribution and integrated operations in the chinese market ensuring their artistic quality market value and roi” film projects expected to receive finance from the fund include “edge of the world” “super nova” “super brain” “instructions not included” “butterfly lovers” and “water margin” “edge of the world” is written by jacqueline feather and david seidler and has hawk

film coproduction project development fund are that the film coproduction projects must first conform to china’s relevant national policies … the projects should to the maximum extent give considerations to cinema distribution digital distribution and integrated operations in the chinese market ensuring their artistic quality market value and roi” because if there’s one thing mainlanders are good at it’s dictating “artistic quality” and “market value” to hollywood as if hollywood wasn’t making movies when china was cooking up new schemes to keep its people miserable for most of the th century and how do they expect to have any success with an “online platform” for chinese films to be seen abroad when their own counterfeit culture has led to chinese films being uploaded to youtube — not toreents mind you but frickin’ youtube — within days of theatrical release couple that with the rampant piracy of discs since nearly the dawn of that format and i’d be hard pressed to believe anybody that believes chinese films aren’t being watched abroad already and by larger numbers than any platform will draw this late in the game at least hong kong cinema was able to gain traction in the west before it too became so easily pirated and sold illegally all over china and even the western diasporas still i’m sure there are plenty of folks in hollywood who’ll have no problem adhering to those “relevant national policies” if it means work mind you based on the titles it’s obvious most of the films on their slate will be designed for the undemanding domestic
