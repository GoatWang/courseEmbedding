expenditures as required for ongoing operations the offering proceeds may not be used to discharge indebtedness if  of the offered shares are sold the company will receive the maximum proceeds of  after paying the company’s offering expenses the company plans to allocate the net proceeds from this offering as follows  towards the salaries of the officers directors employees and independent contractors  for marketing  for the purchase of our astaxanthin products we will allocate  for the development of our website  for our corporate office lease and  to travel expenses if  of the offered shares are sold the company will receive  after paying offering expenses in this case the company plans to cut the staffing budget to  cut the marketing expenses to  cut the purchases of the astaxanthin products budget to  maintain the lease expense to  lower the website development budget to  and eliminate the travel budget in this instance the company’s president may work more on the development of our astaxanthin products and growing the company because we will still have enough money to hire employees who will be able to relieve much of the bookkeeping and ad ministerial load if  of the offered shares are sold the company would receive  after paying offering expenses the company would further cut the staffing budget for the officers and directors to  the company would not be able to hire a full time assistant and would have to rely on temporary workers to bear some of the ad ministerial duties and office workload which will result in the president allocating more time to those activities the company still plans on spending  to astaxanthin products however it would significantly cut the marketing budget to  and the office lease budget to  the company plans to maintain the website budget at  and the travel budget would still be eliminated if the company sells  of the shares under the offering it would be severely restricted in its operating plans and would not have sufficient proceeds to cover offering expenses or operate the company for the year and it will have to pay the remainder of the expenses out of additional financing which it has not yet received the company will not have sufficient proceeds to hire any staff and initiate growth in this instance the company will have to seek out additional capital from alternate sources to fully execute the plan of operations if such funds are not available the business would likely fail and any investment would be lost the funds from this offering may not be used to pay bill macgillivary kenneth lelek or wayne miletta for their services to the company prior to during and subsequent to the offering there can be no assurance that the company will raise any funds through this offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised the company will use such funds according to its best judgment in accordance with the foregoing “use of proceeds” chart and the explanations thereto this discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the “use of proceeds” chart to the extent the offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the company management anticipates paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues the company receive if the company requires additional funding it will seek such funds from friends family and business acquaintances of the officers and directors in order to continue operations as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds and the likelihood that such funds will be available to the company on acceptable terms since the company has not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from the friends family members or business acquaintances of the officers and directors regarding potential investments in the company the industry in which we intend to compete is subject to intense competition we believe that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to continually enhance and improve our products and technologies in order to do so we plan to effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority technical support availability of patent protection protection of trade secrets access to adequate capital ability to develop acquire and market products successfully ability to obtain governmental approvals and ability to serve the particular needs of customers we intend to compete on the basis of safety effectiveness convenience manufacturing superiority intellectual property and where appropriate price global production of natural astaxanthin is dominated by four companies º cyanotech hawaii usa º parry nutraceuticals india º fuji chemicals japansweden º algatechnologies israel supply does not currently meet demand future supply as defined by current and planned supply expansions is not likely to meet future demand as extrapolated from current supply gaps the expanding range of applications and consumer interest trends also we will compete against chemically nonnaturally produced astaxanthin companies because of the broad manifestation of inflammation in chronic disease numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing or producing antiinflammatory therapeutic agents these companies include but are not limited to abbvie astrazeneca bayer bristolmyers squibb eli lilly glaxosmithkline johnson  johnson merck nestlepamlab novartis pfizer and takeda in addition to competing with nonastaxanthin antiinflammatory drugs we intend to compete with microalgal astaxanthin nutraceutical  dietary supplement products on the basis of our ability to purchase large quantities of astaxanthin from our joint venture agreement we believe our ability to purchase astaxanthin from producers instead of investing in expensive production facilities will result in higher potential sales and that we will be able to achieve those sales at an earlier stage as we would not have to first invest in the production facilities to produce the natural astaxanthin our success will also depend in large part on our ability to obtain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary blends and trademarks that we consider important to our business we intend to seek appropriate patent protection for our products where applicable by filing patent applications in the united states and other selected countries we intend for these patent applications to cover where applicable claims for composition of matter uses processes for preparation and formulations our success will also depend on our ability and the ability of our current andor future partners to maintain trade secrets related to proprietary production methods for products that we or our partners intend to market the company is subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial businesses generally and of distribution businesses in particular including competing in an environment where other companies may be better financed or have more experience that the company company description

from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from coal pollution mitigation technology jump to navigation search this article is about technological innovations related to coal pollution mitigation for the general concept of mitigation see coal pollution mitigation clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the environmental impact of coal energy generation and to mitigate worldwide climate change when coal is used as a fuel source the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include sulphur dioxide so nitrogen oxides nox mercury and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used these emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health contributing to acid rain lung cancer and cardiovascular disease as a result clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also igcc improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal historically the primary focus was on so and nox the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter contents  technology  demonstration projects in the united states  clean coal and the environment  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links  magazines and journals  websites  government web sites  university web sites technologyedit several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept precombustion capture – this involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a h and corich gas mixture from which the co can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered this technology is usually associated with integrated gasification combined cycle process configurations postcombustion capture – this refers to capture of co from exhaust gases of combustion processes oxyfuel combustion – fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient lowcost co capture the kemper county igcc project a  mw coal gasificationbased power plant will use precombustion capture of co to capture  of the co the plant produces which will be utilizedgeologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations the saskatchewan governments boundary dam integrated carbon capture and sequestration demonstration project will use postcombustion aminebased scrubber technology to capture  of the co emitted by unit  of the power plant this co will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields an oxyfuel ccs power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the co so that it may be stored or sequestered an early example of a coalbased plant using oxyfuel carboncapture technology is swedish company vattenfall’s schwarze pumpe power station located in spremberg germany built by german firm siemens which went online in september  the facility captures co and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the co into a liquid plans are to inject the co into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical other examples of oxycombustion carbon capture are in progress callide power station has

oxides nox mercury and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used these emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health contributing to acid rain lung cancer and cardiovascular disease as a result clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal gasification see also igcc improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals brown coals to improve the calorific value and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal historically the primary focus was on so and nox the most important gases in causation of acid rain and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and environmental damage and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter contents  technology  demonstration projects in the united states  clean coal and the environment  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links  magazines and journals  websites  government web sites  university web sites technologyedit several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by the clean coal concept precombustion capture – this involves gasification of a feedstock such as coal to form synthesis gas which may be shifted to produce a h and corich gas mixture from which the co can be efficiently captured and separated transported and ultimately sequestered this technology is usually associated with integrated gasification combined cycle process configurations postcombustion capture – this refers to capture of co from exhaust gases of combustion processes oxyfuel combustion – fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated flue gas and oxygen rather than in air which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient lowcost co capture the kemper county igcc project a  mw coal gasificationbased power plant will use precombustion capture of co to capture  of the co the plant produces which will be utilizedgeologically sequestered in enhanced oil recovery operations the saskatchewan governments boundary dam integrated carbon capture and sequestration demonstration project will use postcombustion aminebased scrubber technology to capture  of the co emitted by unit  of the power plant this co will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the weyburn oil fields an oxyfuel ccs power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the co so that it may be stored or sequestered an early example of a coalbased plant using oxyfuel carboncapture technology is swedish company vattenfall’s schwarze pumpe power station located in spremberg germany built by german firm siemens which went online in september  the facility captures co and acid rain producing pollutants separates them and compresses the co into a liquid plans are to inject the co into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for co reduction in the atmosphere but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical other examples of oxycombustion carbon capture are in progress callide power station has retrofitted a mwth existing pcfired power plant to operate in oxyfuel mode in ciuden spain endesa has a newly built mwth oxyfuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion cfbc technology babcockthermoenergys zero emission boiler system zebs is oxycombustionbased this system features near  carboncapture and according to company information virtually no airemissions other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that dewater lowrank coals lowrank coals often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne this causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to  percentcitation needed the uk governments is working towards a clean energy future and supports clean coal projects across the country in august  ukbased company b coal announced a clean coal project with  carbon capture to be put forward to decc this would help the uk raise its profile amongst green leaders across the world this proposed project gasifies coal underground and processes it to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide the hydrogen is then used as an emissionsfree fuel to run an alkaline fuel cell whilst the carbon dioxide is captured this uk project could provide a worldleading template for clean coal with ccs globally demonstration projects in
