not made an initial capital call  includes ngp etp i ngp mr ngp etp ii ngp viii and ngp ix trends affecting our business during  and into  significant events in the global political landscape developments at the federal reserve during the first quarter appear to have eased concerns of market participants that larger fiscal deficits in the us or accelerating inflation tied to rising commodity prices and tighter labor markets could force the federal reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than was expected by the futures markets instead the federal reserve has signaled that it anticipates only three rate increases this year which would not be expected to cause significant downward pressure on the valuations of private equity assets real estate or the net asset values of fixed income products or markedly increase the cost of financing for acquisition transactions during the first quarter transaction financing generally was readily available on favorable terms in both the us and europe and global leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter was stronger than in any quarter since  during the first quarter global private equitybacked acquisitions totaled  billion which was nearly threetimes larger than the volume observed in  and well above the quarterly average over the prior five years we anticipate that the combination of continued access to favorable financing and an abundance of capital available to invest by many private equity sponsors and strategic buyers will continue to boost ma activity levels for the remainder of  asset prices remain high but despite the competitive market for transactions we have continued to identify and close on investments with strong underlying business fundamentals that meet our strategic objectives and investment criteria in particular we have sharpened our focus on transactions where our investment teams have a particular edge such as having deep industry experience the ability to handle complex corporate carve outs or relationships with strong management teams whose talents are aligned with a particular business challenge during the first quarter we invested  billion in capital through our carry funds and realized proceeds of  billion just over half of which was from our investment solutions segment where realized proceeds do not yet generate significant realized performance fees for us realized proceeds are expected to be more variable on a quarterly basis this year as compared to prior periods because a smaller percentage of our carry fund portfolio is in liquid public securities the positive economic climate and the strong underlying performance of many of the portfolio companies in our funds facilitated the appreciation of our carry funds during the first quarter following the significant appreciation achieved by our largest carry funds during  during the first quarter our overall carry fund portfolio valuation increased  with a  increase in our corporate private equity funds a  increase in our real assets funds a  increase in our global market strategies funds and a  increase in our investment solutions funds our private portfolio appreciated by  and our public portfolio appreciated by  during the quarter excluding investment solutions although we achieved strong results for the quarter driven by strong appreciation across our portfolio we continue to view  as a transition year for our business we anticipate raising  billion in gross new capital over the fouryear period that began in  continuing through the end of  during the first quarter of  we raised  billion of new capital and we expect an accelerating level of fundraising for the remainder of  and over the next two years future fund closings are likely to be weighted towards real assets in  while we anticipate that fundraising in corporate private equity will accelerate later in  and more so into  in addition we have several credit and investment solutions funds that also will be raising capital in the next several years our high level of realizations over the past several quarters has lowered our feeearning assets under management which has resulted in lower levels of feerelated earnings during the balance of  feerelated earnings will likely remain below  levels in large part due to fundraising costs but also as a result of further investment in growing our credit business we expect that feeearning assets under management and feerelated earnings will grow in  after raising new capital and activating the related fees recent transactions transaction with claren road strategic investment in ngp key financial measures revenues fund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the partnership on behalf of the carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements including amounts related to the pursuit of actual proposed or unconsummated investments professional fees expenses associated with the acquisition holding and disposition of investments and other fund administrative expenses funds carried interest revenue which historically has comprised over  of all performance fees in our consolidated financial statements is recognized by carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date accordingly the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds underlying investments measured at their thencurrent fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period as a result the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date refer to  trends affecting our business for further discussion in addition to its performance fees from our corporate private equity and real assets funds and closedend carry funds in the global market strategies segment we are also entitled to receive performance fees from our investment solutions and ngp carry funds the timing of performance fee realizations for these funds is typically later than in our other carry funds based on the terms of such arrangements  million from carlyle partners v lp cp v with total aum of approximately  billion and  million from carlyle asia partners iv lp cap iv
