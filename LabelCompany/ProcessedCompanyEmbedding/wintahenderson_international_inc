“us” “our” and the “company” they refer to wintahenderson international inc formerly known as europa acquisition i inc  “sec” refers to the securities and exchange commission            part i   item  business   business development   the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on june     the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination  since inception the company has been engaged in organizing efforts and obtaining initial financing  as a result the company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business     on october   the “closing date” the company entered into a stock purchase agreement the “agreement” by and among the company peter reichard and peter coker each a former stockholder of the company and beige holdings llc “beige” and marlin financial group inc “marlin” pursuant to which beige and marlin acquired all of the company’s then outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for payment by beige and marlin to messrs reichard and coker in the aggregate amount of  the “october transaction”  such shares represented all of our then outstanding shares of common stock   upon the closing of the october transaction mr reichard resigned as our president effective immediately and gregory schwartz was appointed as our president and chief executive officer effectively immediately  in addition mr reichard resigned as a member of our board of directors and mr schwartz was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors  in accordance with rule f under the exchange act mr reichard’s resignation from and mr schwartz’s appointment to our board of directors became effective on october     on january   the company beige marlin and allan c schwartz entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which beige and marlin sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock which represented  of the then outstanding shares of our common stock to allan c schwartz for a total purchase price of  the “january transaction”  in addition the company and allan c schwartz covenanted to beige that gregory schwartz shall not be removed from any of his positions with the company without the prior written consent by beige   on may   gregory schwartz resigned as our president effective immediately and allan schwartz was appointed as our president and chief executive officer effectively immediately  in addition mr g schwartz resigned as a member of our board of directors and mr a schwartz was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors  in accordance with rule f under the exchange act mr g schwartz’s resignation from and mr a schwartz’s appointment to our board of directors became effective on may     on july   we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation the “amendment” to change the name of the company from “europa acquisition  inc” to “wintahenderson international inc” the amendment was effective july       business of issuer   the company is a “blank check” company the sec defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section  a of the exchange act and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies” pursuant to rule b under the exchange act the company also qualifies as a “shell company” because it has no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as it is subject to those requirements   the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation the company’s principal business objective for the next twelve  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business              the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of allan schwartz our sole officer and director as of this date the company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the company the company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets the company will consider the following factors   ● potential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products ● competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole ● strength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment ● capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the company or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources ● the cost of participation by the company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials ● the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced ● the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items and ● other relevant factors   in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex due to the company’s limited capital available for investigation the company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired   form of acquisition   the manner in which the company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the company and the promoters of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such promoters  we do not intend to solicit prospective investors for any transaction we will rely on word of mouth to locate potential merger candidates   it is likely that the company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the company although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a socalled “tax free” reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity if a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the code all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain  or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity under other circumstances depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties prior stockholders may retain substantially less than  of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity this could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the company prior to such reorganization   the present stockholders of the company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the company following a reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction all or a majority of the company’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders   in the case of an acquisition the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders in the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the company it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities the necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders most likely management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval  notwithstanding same since we currently have only  shareholder we intend to provide our shareholders with complete disclosure concerning a possible target entity and its business including audited financial statements if available to us prior to any merger or acquisition   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the company of the related costs incurred   we presently have no employees apart from our management our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified we expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes if any incident to a business combination                item a         risk factors   smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item     item            properties   the company neither rents nor owns any properties  we utilize the office space and equipment of our management at no cost management estimates such amounts to be immaterial we currently have no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate real estate mortgages or securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities   item             legal proceedings   we are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations there is no action suit proceeding inquiry or investigation before or by any court public board government agency selfregulatory organization or body pending or to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries threatened against or affecting our company our common stock any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect   item           mine safety disclosures   not applicable   part ii   item              market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities   no established public trading market exists for the company’s common stock there are no plans proposals arrangements or understandings with any person with regard to the development of a trading market in any of the company’s common stock   common stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock par value  per share  the common stock is not listed on a publiclytraded market  as of september   there was one stockholder of record holding an aggregate of  shares of common stock   preferred stock   our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock par value  per share  as of september   there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding   dividends   to date we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock when issued pursuant to this offering although we intend to retain our earnings if any to finance the exploration and growth of our business our board of directors will have the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future   payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings capital requirements and other factors which our board of directors may deem relevant   unregistered sales of equity securities   none   securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   we presently do not have any equity based or other longterm incentive programs  in the future we may adopt and establish an equitybased or other longterm incentive plan if it is in the best interest of the company and our stockholders to do so                  item             selected financial data   smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item   item             management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation   the following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition the discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements which involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ significantly from the results expectations and plans discussed in these forwardlooking statements    plan of operation   we were organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings  we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury or with additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors   during the next twelve  months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of exchange act reports and consummating an acquisition   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors   we have negative working capital negative stockholders’ equity and have not earned any revenues from operations to date these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations   we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   our officers and directors have not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks   our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another                we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have andor the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex   recent developments   on october   messrs reichard and coker sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to beige and an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to marlin for an aggregate purchase price of   such shares represented all of our then outstanding shares of common stock  in addition mr reichard resigned as our president effective immediately and mr schwartz was appointed as our president and chief executive officer effectively immediately  in addition mr reichard resigned as a member of our board of directors and mr schwartz was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors  in accordance with rule f under the exchange act mr reichard’s resignation from and mr wang’s appointment to our board of directors became effective on october     on january   the company beige marlin and allan c schwartz entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which beige and marlin sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock which represented  of the then outstanding shares of our common stock to allan c schwartz for a total purchase price of   in addition the company and allan c schwartz covenanted to beige that gregory schwartz shall not be removed from any of his positions with the company without the prior written consent by beige   on may   gregory schwartz resigned as our president effective immediately and allan schwartz was appointed as our president and chief executive officer effectively immediately  in addition mr g schwartz resigned as a member of our board of directors and mr a schwartz was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors  in accordance with rule f under the exchange act mr g schwartz’s resignation from and mr a schwartz’s appointment to our board of directors became effective on may     on july   we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation the “amendment” to change the name of the company from “europa acquisition  inc” to wintahenderson international inc” the amendment was effective july     results of operation   we did not have any operating income from inception through june     for the fiscal years ended june   and  we recognized a net loss of  and  expenses for the fiscal years ended june   and  were comprised of costs mainly associated with legal accounting and office expense   liquidity and capital resources   at june   we had cash of   we intend to rely upon the issuance of common stock and loans from shareholders to fund administrative expenses pending acquisition of an operating company  however our shareholders are under no obligation to provide such funding   management anticipates seeking out a target company through solicitation  such solicitation may include newspaper or magazine advertisements mailings and other distributions to law firms accounting firms investment bankers financial advisors and similar persons the use of one or more internet sites and similar methods  no estimate can be made as to the number of persons who will be contacted or solicited management may engage in such solicitation directly or may employ one or more other entities to conduct or assist in such solicitation management and its affiliates will pay referral fees to consultants and others who refer target businesses for mergers into public companies in which management and its affiliates have an interest  payments are made if a business combination occurs and may consist of cash or a portion of the stock in the company retained by management and its affiliates or both   as discussed above we incurred a net loss of  and  for fiscal years ended june   and   cash used in operating activities during fiscal years ended june   and  were  and   as of june   and  we had a stockholders’ deficiency of  and   accordingly there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan  the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern                management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern   allan schwartz will supervise the search for target companies as potential candidates for a business combination allan schwartz will pay at his own expense any costs he incurs in supervising the search for a target company allan schwartz may enter into agreements with other consultants to assist in locating a target company and may share stock received by it or cash resulting from the sale of its securities with such other consultants   critical accounting policies   we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations the list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies  in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for managements judgment in their application   the company accounts for income taxes under fasb codification topic  “asc ”  under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
