history and a great future  a mine that is  years of age but never operated   john kearney chairman and ceo canadian zinc corporation czn is committed to the responsible and sustainable development of mineral deposits throughout canada the prairie creek mine has a high grade proven and probable reserves measuring  million tonnes with an average grade  zn  pb and  gt ag these reserves will support a mine life for  years and the mine will operate in a responsible manner without compromising the ecological value or the importance of the area to first nations conservationists and the public in general czn has every intention of operating the prairie creek mine with best available technology and environmental protection so that the temporary impact on the environment during operations are minimal and long term effects after closure will be negligible wherever the company operates canadian zinc believes that mineral development and conservation of ecological resources need not be mutually exclusive the companys vision is the development and successful operation of the prairie creek mine with controlled road access where the ecology is protected and mineral extraction with its related economic benefits successfully coexist with traditional aboriginal land uses and the nahanni national park reserve the mine will operate for a relatively short time and will bring substantial benefits to local communities in the form of business opportunities training and jobs and will be a catalyst for regional development tourism and economic activity that can be sustained long after
