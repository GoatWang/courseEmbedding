polymer modified asphalt emulsion macrosello® system  introduced in mexico in  this system is supported by the construction of surfaces using an irrigation system before applying the system the particular existing conditions on the highways are considered to achieve maximum performance styler® technology is used along with one pass chip sealing equipment that allows the asphalt material to adhere to the rock as a result materials have been saved—the dispensing is controlled—and a uniform secure surface layer with quick return to traffic and high durability is achieved duramix® system  high performance coldmix technology this system’s application has been promoted since  the objective is to develop high quality surfaces that have characteristics similar to hot mix with a savings of up to  the result has been the production of better quality rural roads and greater conservation of federal highways in addition the duramix system reduces environmental pollution during the paving process fillmix  this is a next generation product developed by our engineering division for permanent repair of potholes and shoving involving design processing and application of the asphalt mix with complete technical support   recycling plus system  this system consists of full depth reclamation base stabilization it increases the pavement’s structural capacity and supports flexibility following a specialized engineering design the existing pavement andor granular base is uniformly pulverized to a depth of  to  centimeters treated with a special emulsion and then compacted rodamat system  this new technology was introduced in mexico in  by semmaterials mexico it consists of the application of an ultrathin layer of hot mix over a highly adherent membrane and stylink® technology in the polymer modification the simultaneous mixing is done by equipment especially designed for that purpose the result is a surface layer with a high level of noise absorption and above all makes for a very comfortable ride everpav™ system  this system combines superior performance asphalt products and regional aggregates we use the most advanced technology for the application process and the
