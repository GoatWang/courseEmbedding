website terms of service product license agreement  dun  bradstreet inc  all rights reserved consac calls for bebe stores chairman manny mashouf and board to sell or take retailer private consac calls for bebe stores chairman manny mashouf and board to sell or take retailer private aug    et from consac llc los angeles aug   prnewswire  a shareholder who holds approximately three  million shares of the common stock of bebe stores inc today called upon manny mashouf  the companys chairman and controlling shareholder and its board of directors to either sell the company to a third party or take it private in a transaction sponsored by the mashouf family  mr mashouf owns approximately  percent of the common stock of the company whose performance has declined over the past several years ryan drexler president of consac llc questioned the appropriateness of mr mashoufs role as both a paid director of the company and consultant to the board  he also pointed to the absence of the chairman in actively guiding the company to a successful and sustainable recovery citing the companys lack of attention to fashion focus innovation and design hallmarks of the companys growth under the creative direction of neda mashouf who left the company after divorcing mr mashouf several years ago progress in developing a compelling ecommerce offering a succession plan and the difficulty of identifying candidates with the right mix of merchandising and financial knowhow amid dramatically shifting skills for retail fashion executives fast fashion retail experience of the board and management i believe the board must consider alternatives that are in the best interest of the companys public shareholders mr drexler wrote  i urge you to explore the possibilities available to the board in creating sustainable value for all investors in his letter mr drexler referred to a recent analyst report that concluded that bebes current return on equity significantly trails that of the specialty retail industry and is lower than roe from the same quarter the prior year reported q gross profit margin of  percent decreased from the same quarter last year and that the companys reported net profit margin of almost  percent is significantly below that of the industry average q net operating cash flow has decreased almost  percent compared to the same quarter last year bebes stock price continues to slide dramatically mr drexlers letter to the bebe stores board of directors follows august   board of directorsbebe stores inc valley drivebrisbane ca  gentlemen twice in the past month i have made attempts to meet with mr mashouf to discuss issues critical to the future of the company namely the inability of management and the board to meaningfully address the companys persistently lagging operating performance and the resulting underperformance of its stock  twice i have been rebuffed as the owner of  million shares of bebe common stock i believe that most stockholders share my concerns  a  analysis of bebes most recently reported financial performance q  by thestreet concludes that current return on equity is lower than roe from the same quarter the prior year and significantly trails that of the specialty retail industry bebes reported q gross profit margin of  percent decreased from the same quarter last year  in addition the companys reported net profit margin of almost  percent is significantly below that of the industry average the companys q net operating cash flow has decreased almost  percent compared to the same quarter last year bebes stock price continues to slide these facts lead me and others to conclude that the company needs to explore possibilities for maximizing shareholder value including a sale of the company whether to a third party or through a going private transaction  other issues leading to this conclusion include the following governance i believe mr mashouf continues to collect directors compensation plus fees payable to the consulting firm of which he president  skid holdings llc headquartered in las vegas is paid almost  a month or  a year plus costs amounting to more than  percent of the annual fee to provide consulting services to the bebe board  as a shareholder i find this questionable moreover other than his role as chairman of bebe and president of the company that provides its board with consulting services mr mashouf has seemingly been absent in actively guiding the company to a successful and sustainable recovery   i believe the inability of management and the board to implement a workable strategy follows from this product design and merchandising the company has been unsuccessful in communicating a convincing strategy that addresses the core issues of declining sales dwindling customer traffic and lack of fashion focus and imagination bebe has lost its fashion relevance  it has all but disappeared from the radar the companys financial strategy as discussed in its most recent earnings report seems to have supplanted muchneeded attention to fashion focus innovation and design hallmarks of the companys growth under the creative direction of neda mashouf bebes advertising and messaging are confused unappealing and unmemorable  who is the bebe girl ecommerce progress has been slow in developing a compelling ecommerce offering that can offset the increasingly high cost of rent store personnel and the deleveraging of store infrastructure the announced closings of the b stores and the elimination of concomitant elimination of jobs do little if anything to demonstrate to investors positive movement in addressing the companys retail shortcomings   management experience and stability the issue of succession planning has to my knowledge not been publicly addressed  once the company does so it will find that the skills for retail fashion executives have shifted dramatically and identifying candidates with the right mix of merchandising and financial knowhow will be difficult the board and management lack adequate fast fashion retail experience i have the utmost regard for what mr mashouf and his associates have achieved for shareholders in the past  at the same time i see no evidence that such performance can be repeated under the companys current structure  i believe the board must consider alternatives that are in the best interest of the companys public shareholders including a sale of the company to a third party or a going private transaction sponsored by the mashouf family  i urge you to immediately explore the possibilities available to the board in creating sustainable value for all investors  i continue to welcome the opportunity to meet with management and the board very truly yours ryan drexlerpresident about consac

success and in gratitude gives back generously to the society that has afforded him such opportunity an entrepreneur and philanthropist he is the founder and board chairman of the highly successful bebe chain of women’s clothing stores now almost  across the nationarriving in the us from his native iran with minimal english skills but with high aspirations mr mashouf rapidly mastered the language then higher education at san francisco state university from which he graduated in  he explored many subjects beyond his political science major in fact the name of his corporation was inspired he says by shakespeare’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy from hamletwith success has come mr mashouf’s conviction that he has an obligation to put his wealth to work for the greater good while his generosity has been broadbased his major cause of choice has been education “i believe that the most effective way to improve the quality of our lives for the future is to improve the quality of our children’s education” he saysmr mashouf has never forgotten his roots at san francisco state university he is an year member of the college of business advisory board and has made significant
