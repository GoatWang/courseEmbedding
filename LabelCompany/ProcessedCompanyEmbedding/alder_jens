introduction conjugated dienes undergo a cycloaddition reaction with multiple bonds to form unsaturated sixmembered rings in conventional terminology this is a addition of a diene and a dienophile this reaction has a great synthetic importance and was discovered by two german chemists otto diels and kurt alder who received the  nobel prize the simplest dielsalder reaction is the reaction of butadiene and ethylene to yield cyclohexene figure  figure   dielsalder addition of ethylene and butadiene reaction mechanism the dielsalder reaction is a thermal cycloaddition whose mechanism involves the sigmaoverlap of the piorbitals of the two unsaturated systems there is not a single mechanism for all dielsalder reactions at first approximation we can divide them into two classes  synchronous and symmetrical concerted mechanisms when the two new bonds are formed simultaneously in the transition state the two forming bonds have the same lengths the combination of ethylene and butadiene is one example multistage nonconcerted and asynchronous mechanisms the transition state is a diradical one bond being formed the other not real mechanisms are a mixture of these two extremes one bond being more properly formed and thus shorter than the other figure   mechanisms of the dielsalder reaction to have an idea of the mechanism and to calculate the activation energy of a reaction we have to find its transition state using a gradient minimization the transition state of the dielsalder addition of butadiene and ethylene shows that it looks like the reactants it is called an early transition state reaction study here are the different computation results that we can get with the different computational methods  unit  kcalmolactivation energyhreaction enthalpyh mm pm am table   computation results for the diels alder additin of ethylene and butadiene experiments give us the arrhenius activation energy   kcalmol for a temperature between k and k the activation enthalpy is then rt kcalmol equation  two remarks can be made on this result  the difference between the activation enthalpy and the arrhenius activation energy is not so important when this distinction is not meaningful we will only refer to activation energy there is a small difference between the pm and the am value but as expected the pm value is closer to the experimental result than the am one the difference with the experiments could be due to the temperature the calculations of the activation energy and the reaction enthalpy are carried out at k endo  exo  selectivity when both the diene and the dienophile are suitably substituted a stereochemical feature arises because the reactants may approach each other in two distinct orientations the substituent on the dienophile may be directed away from the diene exo  approach or toward the diene endo  approach this stereochemical difference is often found with cyclic compounds one very simple exemple is the dielsalder addition of two cyclopentadiene figure  figure   dielsalder addition of two cyclopentadienes mechanisms in most dielsalder reactions when the product distribution is under kinetic control the endo adduct is preferentially sometimes exclusively formed several hypotheses have been made to explain this selectivity  alder proposed that endo addition was the consequence of a planetoplane orientation of diene and dienophile with maximum accumulation of double bonds since this same orientation would promote stability in a molecular complex it has been suggested that complex formation between the reactants may be responsible for preferential endo addition woodward and hoffmann ascribe endo addition to interaction of occupied orbitals with unoccupied orbitals the endo transition state conformation being favored by orbital symmetry relative to the exo conformation with the model of frontier orbitals we have interaction of homos highest occupied molecular orbitals with lumos lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals those interactions are represented in figure  the main interactions that will form the bonds are shown by plain bold lines the secondary interactions responsible for the endoexo selectivity are shown by small squiggly lines we do not know if the molecules approch so closely that the secondary interactions can be as important as shown in figure  studies of dielsalder transition states can also give an explanation of this selectivity the transition state in an asynchronous mechanism can be described using several resonance structures figure  one of this resonance structure is a zwitterion in the endo transition state the proximity of the two charges stabilizes this structure and thus favours the endo addition for the addition of the two cyclopentadienes the forming bond lengths are  å and  å in the exo transition state and  å and  å in the endo transition state this prove that the mechanism for this addition is asynchronous and that the endo transition state is more assymetric ie  the zwitterion resonance strucure is more favorized than in the exo attack exoattackendoattack figure   homolumo interactions in the dielsalder addition of two cyclopentadienes in the

endoexoendoexo am pm table   calculation results for the dielsalder reaction of two cyclopentadienes we have here the opportunity to calibrate the results given by the semiempirical program mopac that we used to calculate the activation energy the reaction enthalpy and the geometry of the molecules and transition states we see that calculation gives a small exo preference whereas only the endoadduct is formed we should be aware of this during the other experiments influence of the entropy h°rkcalmol s°rcalkmol g°rkcalmol hkcalmol skcalkmol gkcalmol pm exo       endo       table   dielsalder addition of two cyclopentadienedetailed thermochemical parameters at k the reaction entropy and activation entropy differences are very small and we can neglect their effect on the gibbs freeenergies g°r and g calculated using equation  and  this is not surprising because the exo and the endo reactions are very similar in both cases we have the addition of two reagents that yield one product and the bond transformations are identical to compare dielsalder reactions it is a good approximation to study only the reaction enthalpies hess law  enables us to calculate them easily with the outputs of the calculations which are often heats of formation the reaction enthalpy differences are almost the same as those of gibbs free energy influence of the temperature

parameters at k and k we have a confirmation that the yield of the dielsalder addition decreases with the temperature with a temperature higher than k we would favour the reverse reaction this is due to the negative entropy that favours dissociation and its importance increases with temperature we observe that there is no change in the endoexo selectivity and that the entropy differences between endo and exo products and transition states are so small that we do not need to take them into account we conclude that we only need to deal with the heats of formation at k to predict endoexo selectivity in the dielsalder additions this does not let us have any ideas about the yield of such reactions but only on the selectivity  cyclopentadiene is a volatile hydrocarbon bp °c available commercially as a dimer that can be cracked thermally the dimer boils at °c when the free monomer has been prepared by slow distillation of the dimer it must be used immediately as it redimerizes on
