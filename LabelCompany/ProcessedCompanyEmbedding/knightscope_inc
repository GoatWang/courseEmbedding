investors invest offering circular frequently asked questions we have the answers company values  general company info privacy cost shipping features  capabilities concerns when was knightscope founded the company was incorporated in april  why did you start knightscope knightscope was originally founded in response to the tragic events at sandy hook and the boston marathon the founders believed that with a unique combination of hardware and software they could greatly reduce crime… by as much as  how do you respond to those who insist remote presence devicesremote sensors are threats to individual privacy interestingly a person’s picture is taken approximately  times per day in public without threatening individual privacy generally speaking an expectation of privacy in public areas is not necessarily logical with emphasis on the word ‘public’ privacy is recognized in areas such as one’s residence phone booths hotel rooms and places provided to ensure privacy like a conference room or restroom knightscope is focused on public areas away from those private spaces the real threat is violence which the company is working hard to curtail what about privacy concerns how does your company address them in the longterm knightscope intends to live stream any and all information gathered to the community and the authorities with full transparency when a safety alert is generated by leveraging the social media infrastructure knightscope can make crowdsourcing security a reality technology will save lives and improve society encryption communication at the machine level is achieved using n wifi and wpa with enterprise encryption while the knightscope security operations center ksoc uses secure sockets layer for data transmission knightscope can however accommodate other common encryption methods as required by clients how much will each knightscope machine cost a member of knightscope’s sales team works directly with customers to determine the best application of machines to custom tailor a solution to their specific needs visit our contact page to schedule a demonstration today can you ship the robots to locations outside of the us knightscope is currently laser focused on the us market and more specifically the state of california expansion efforts are underway to begin scaling across the continental us in  crime is a global issue that must be addressed and future exports will be determined after the platform is proven completely successful locally what is a knightscope adm knightscope autonomous data machines adms are autonomous robots that provide a commanding but friendly physical security presence the k and k gather important realtime onsite data through their numerous sensors which is then processed with advanced anomaly detection software to determine if there is a concern or threat in the area if so an event is created with an appropriate alert level and a notification is sent to the proper authorities through the knightscope security operations center ksoc a browser based user interface who will use a knightscope adm knightscope adms may be used in many industries and environments the human attention span during monotonous boring tasks is only  minutes and with employee turnover rates as high as  the security industry is rightfully seeking innovative solutions knightscope’s primary goal is to allow customers to utilize the best of silicon valley to put machines to work in those routine and sometimes dangerous situations thus freeing up humans to do the more handson and strategic activities corporate campuses data centers shopping malls and hospitals are among the many clients already engaged today think employee safety corporate espionage rogue networks asset protection etc what is the battery life of an adm the knightscope k and k autonomously recharge themselves periodically preventing long periods of downtime and allowing for the transfer of data to the cloud or to a server machines are designed to handle operation  hours a day  days a week and provide continuous monitoring even while charging is an adm bulletproof unfortunately there is no such thing as “bulletproof” the knightscope k is ruggedized and protected against vandalism its size and sensor payload also contribute to its durability the knightscope k is intended to be an “inside the fence” security apparatus but it is still protected by the same sensor payload are your machines weaponized adms are friendly community tools used exclusively to deliver relevant and realtime information to the appropriate authorities not to enforce the law machines provide an additional set of intelligent eyes and ears used to help security and law enforcement professionals do their jobs more effectively how will you prevent people from defacing or damaging an adm knightscope identified several options such as proximity sensors several alarm stages and vandalproof coatings to protect the robots but they won’t give away all of their secrets here are there any thermal or environmental sensors available yes a thermal camera that sees temperatures ranging from  degrees to  centigrade is included on each adm the thermal sensor is capable of detecting variances in temperatures as little as  degrees centigrade what kind of photos or videos is the robot taking the knightscope adm visually observes its surroundings through the use of video cameras a thermal camera and license plate recognition devices while the adms are unique in appearance and delivery system the security service that they provide are already commonly accepted in the public domain with fixed security camera systems machines proactively seek out anomalies that might suggest criminal activity – eg people in restricted areas – and alerting proper authorities when a concern is detected where and how long is the data stored knightscope will work with each customer to determine the ideal location to store data and the lifespan of each data set what types of sensors are onboard the adm sensor payload includes light detection and ranging lidar devices highdefinition lowlight video cameras thermal imaging automatic license plate recognition alpr directional microphones proximity sensors inertial measurement unit wheel encoders and a global positioning system gps what speed does the robot travel safety is critical at knightscope so an adm will only operate at speeds that are reasonable and prudent for the surrounding conditions although the k and k are capable of faster speeds they primarily operate in the  mph range under normal circumstances how does the robot know where it is each adm operates within a predefined geofenced area and much like a human a machine does not rely solely on one sensor to determine its current location and plot a directional path it utilizes data from multiple sensors – lidar gps inertial and wheel odometry sensors – to develop a complete picture of its environment and determine a position within those boundaries the adm then carefully navigates fully autonomously along a random path seeking to thwart any evildoers how do you measure our robots performance in terms of machine health a dashboard will be provided as part of the knightscope security operations center ksoc offering to look at overall network health as well as the health of each individual machine does it return to its charging station autonomously yes adms are constantly monitoring their own health and will optimize charge times and durations in order to ensure consistent power levels and performance are the machines safe to operate in large crowded environments knightscope adms are fully autonomous and can navigate through an environment with moving objects the technology is similar to that being utilized by the driverless cars that actively operate on the public roadways across several us states today will knightscope technologies eliminate human security guards absolutely not there will always be a need for human security guards to do the strategic work the k and k simply provide them with relevant realtime information thus extending the human security guards’ awareness and allowing them to make more appropriate decisions software  hardware  humans the ultimate combination are knightscope technologies intended to replace law enforcement officers no they are intended to help and assist officers improve response times and keep them out of harm’s way if possible what can you tell us about the safety of the sensors infrared etc knightscope utilizes commercially available offtheshelf sensors that are already proven safe and effective for everyday use can customers remotely wipe the data in the event of robot theft yes failsafe measures will be implemented to ensure the security of the data how will you prevent people from defacing or damaging an adm knightscope adms have several features including proximity sensors escalating alarm stages and the like to protect the robots but why give away all secrets here subscribe page not found • knightscope × demo explore subscribe gallery faq team careers contact press investors invest offering circular
