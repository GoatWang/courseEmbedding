del mar heights rd suite  del mar ca   the world’s first personal aircraft cabin pressure monitor your custom text here    the altalert™  warns pilots when cabin pressure is compromised “even the best trained pilots and oemsupplied warning systems have suffered a lapse in cabin altitude awareness the altalert closes this gap and can save lives” altalert™ is the first and only mountablewearable personal cabin pressure monitor ideal for use in all types of aircraft this revolutionary device is every bit as invaluable as it is portable altalert™ keeps pilots informed of  “relative altitude” and can avoid incidentsaccidents related to cabin pressure problems such as slow cabin pressure leaks and potentially deadly slow onset hypoxia  the altalert™ is made in the usa a potentially lifesaving device for pilots  passengersaltalert™ has been expertly developed by aviation technology™ to provide a new level of confidence and riskmitigation for aircraft pilots and passengers alike exclusively licensed from nasa under us patent  altalert™ will alarm when the cabin reaches an imminent and dangerously high cabin pressurealtitude relative cabin pressure based on faa regulations once activated by installation of the battery included the unit will enter sleep mode while at ground level but will begin sampling pressure and battery voltage every  seconds during climb and while in level flight consistent flying altitude at altitudes above sea level altalert™ will operate as such until the battery is drained or removed usually about  months unless alarm is activated the battery status can be tested at any time by pressing the “test” button relative cabin pressure and battery status is indicated via a series of led color changes and alarm tones  relative cabin pressure and battery status is indicated via a series of led color changes and alarm tones an included chart explains these indications color blinkrate etc in greater detailaltalert™ may be easily mounted on a flat surface in the cockpit or cabin of the aircraft clipped to a visor or worn where sound is not muffled by clothingbuy for just testimonialsi read it in ain alerts thanks for making a product that might save mine and my passengers lives one day mark perich australiai got my altalert unit end of  i installed it which was very easy and i have it in the plane since then  i fly with my piper meridian mostly at fl fl and although the meridian has an altitude warning system in the panel i really like it that i a have a completely independent second altitude alert system in the cabin protecting me and my passengers it’s there always it switches itself on and the only thing i check before flight is the battery status it is a very clever and simpel unit that’s monitoring the cabin altitude for you all the time i can recommend it to every pilot flying pressurized even airline pilots can just have it in their pocket as a personal safety unit  arthur jl valkieser cannes france
