efforts focus on aav and other forms of aav that selectively target liver cells and have been optimized to deliver missing intact genes in diseases associated with the liver initial indications of positive net benefit of this approach in patients demonstration of robust gene expression in multiple preclinical in vivo models and commercially viable novel cmc approaches provide a strong foundation for dimension’s proprietary programs engineered aav vectors dimension’s aav vector technology consists of two components the aav capsid and aav genome which includes the human gene we are replacing the capsid surface structure directs the aav vector for entry into cells and can be engineered to enhance liver tropism within the vector the nonintegrating episomal aav genome can be engineered to enhance cellspecific expression once inside the patient’s cells the coding region of the aav genome directs synthesis of the human therapeutic protein that is missing or deficient in patients liver targeting for diverse applications there are nearly  liverassociated disorders a broad number of potential indications from which dimension can select specific diseases to target for application of its gene therapy platform dimension’s livertargeted aav platform allows the company to strategically build the best product portfolio by actively pursuing programs that meet key criteria for advancement including  transduction and activity levels highly likely to result in clinically relevant efficacy  wellunderstood disease biology and pathway and  significant therapeutic needs multiple programs in hemophilia and inherited metabolic diseases are advancing either in or towards the clinic quality of science quality of life  memorial drive th floor cambridge ma   about us

therapeutic products for people living with rare diseases associated with the liver and caused by genetic mutations the company has programs for hemophilia b hemophilia a ornithine transcarbamylase otc deficiency and glycogen storage disease type ia gsdia the companys gene therapy product candidates and programs are designed to provide a functional copy of an abnormal or missing gene using the advanced adenoassociated virus aavbased vector delivery technology the company uses mammalian cells in its manufacturing approach for its aavbased product candidates its aav manufacturing is performed in over two mammalian cell types human embryonic kidney  cells hek cells and hela cellsdtxdtx is the companys lead gene therapy product candidate designed to deliver factor ix fix gene expression in patients with hemophilia b the companys product candidate dtx is an aavrh capsid containing a codonoptimized fix gene expressing wildtype fix protein aavrh is a member of the clade e family of capsids the company initiated phase iii openlabel clinical trial of dtx in adult males with moderatesevere to severe hemophilia b dtx was granted orphan drug designation in the united statesdtxthe companys product candidate dtx consists of an aav vector that contains a gene that encodes b domain deleted human factor viii fviii which is the commonly used recombinant fviii protein used in protein replacement therapy dtx is designed to preferentially express fviii at therapeutic levels for the treatment of patients with hemophilia a the company initiated investigational new drug indenabling activitiesdtxthe companys product candidate dtx consists of a clade e aav capsid containing an otc gene which is designed to preferentially express human otc in the liver for the treatment of symptomatic patients with lateonset otc deficiency the company focuses on developing dtx for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe otc deficiency the company is completing indenabling studies of dtx dtx was granted orphan drug designation in the united states and europedtxdtx is the companys gene therapy program for the treatment of patients with gsdia a disease that arises from a defect in glucosephosphatase gpase an essential enzyme in glycogen and glucose metabolism the company focuses its dtx clinical development program on adult or young adult patients with uncontrolled or
