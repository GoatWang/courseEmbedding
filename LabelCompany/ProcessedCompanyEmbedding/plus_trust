willmaker  by drew f i do like this product in about  hours i completed all documents for three family members thanks for making the process so easy posted on  everyone should use it  by barbara b informative great flow through steps additional information available posted on  review by james s easy to use and a diy solution which makes financial estate planning quite simple posted on  just what the dr ordered by gregory s my wife and i had been holding off writing wills due to the complexity of a blended family the program worked well for our needs and security of our family posted on  review by michael s quick user friendly program in all areas would recommend to anyone and much cheaper than having a lawyer do it if your estate is simple posted on  a monkey can make a will by paul s much easier than expected took me about  minutes to complete a will there were  beneficiaries and i wished i could break down by percentages instead of fractions posted on  please stop using fractions by craig r it does the job for straightforward simple wills but i wish they would use percentages instead of fractions for how you want to leave your estate posted on  worth the money by thomas m is very comprehensive posted on  great software by alexander h nolo’s quicken willmaker plus is a nice software neatly organized with step by step guidance provided by their tutorial it will help if you spend some time before you use this product and gather all your personal information your financial statements and have them ready before you start making your willmaker documents it worked well for us ps please visit your local county government website for videos and important information regarding the law rules and regulations in the state you are living in the surrogate court probate wills power of attorney advance directives intestacy notice of probate etc thank you nolo posted on  willmaker  far better than past editions by lynne f i find this more comprehensive and helpful by far an improvement over past willmakers i am very pleased posted on  great by william b quicken willmaker plus  from nolo is a complete easy to use system of doityourself legal documents posted on  quicken programs rock by kimberly w willmaker plus  is an awesome product im so glad i purchased it posted on  needed a will asap by jimmy d dont waste your time with the free online wills they arent free i needed to make a will asap this is what i used  years ago and went back to it posted on  good program for the money by gt i like the program with one exception the loss of inputted data when going back to a previous screen for a correction or change can be irritating im sure there is a good reason for this and there may be a work around posted on  happy quicken willmaker user by beverly m sorry for the delay i had downloaded it to my mac and i am a new mac user after i downloaded it i couldnt find it finally found it i totally would recommend quicken willmaker plus  to everyone i have used it before but have recently moved to another state so have to start over it is very user friendly and thorough posted on  nolo user by kay c i have used nolo for years it is easy to use i really like the way it walks you through everything posted on  review by anonymous the program doesnt allow the summary page to be printed which is a big problem when meeting with an estate planning attorney a lot of time is wasted going through the draft will when the summary could have easily answered the attorneys questions as he has his own information gathering checklist the property asset worksheet is ok but the layout could be better to list joint assets iras life insurance etc and the beneficiary chain that are set up that override the will posted on  in maryland by anonymous live in maryland created a will and passed it by my attorney he made some minor modifications basically terms that are no longer used i suggest that the makers update their program to reflect the latest terms used otherwise very easy to use posted on  awesome recommendation by anonymous a financial advisor recommended willmaker and it was not only easy but exactly what i wanteda very simple will the added details on distribution were very helpful and the price unbeatable an awesome tip from the financial advisor posted on  includes all you need by impatient very comprehensive included many details i would not have thought of i had a little trouble printing only the pages i wanted and not the extensive instructions at the beginning of each section the best of the several types of will software i have tried posted on  very please by anonymous very easy to use well thought out program posted on  the format is restrictive by anonymous the program has builtin inflexibility this means that you cannot alter the document from the format that the program offers this is often very awkward and does not flow smoothly as you navigate through the one direction it allows you to so you cannot make a will in any original fashion and add items or add any contingencies what you must do if you want to customize the will is printed out as the program offers it then you must download it into a word program and then you can alter the text and the format the way you want posted on  review by anonymous it is a great program but i wish it used pdf file in the program so it would be better to go back and edit without having to run the program form start posted on  review by anonymous i cant give my review a  because im in the first phase of creating my will  one day but before today my will was the lame  just my possesions got to  using willmaker provided me a framework to know that my wishes would be expressed legally now i feel comfortable that my wishes have been expressed legally posted on  easier by anonymous very hard to go back and change something like remove or add a name when you print it otherwise good i liked it posted on  review by anonymous a great product posted on  user friendly by anonymous i have not used any other software related to wills so i have no comparison but this one was user friendly and it had a lot of information in it i didnt know i would definitely use this software again if i had to do it all over again of course ill have to use it for updates on my will but i would pick it again posted on  helped me consolidate and simplify by anonymous quicken willmaker plus  is a very good product my wife and i needed to update our wills willmaker makes that very easy but i discovered that a number of other documents ms word and ms excel i had created for the executor and for the funeral home could be consolidated within the willmaker program i pasted a good deal of information into willmaker and then deleted unneeded word and excel files most of my information is now in one place  willmaker our family is in constant fluctuation future revisions will be necessary and will be easier my wife and i decided that we need to review our will and all of our estate information on a yearly basis in the end my executor will appreciate having all the information in one place one format and uptodate posted on  review by anonymous i am very pleased with the new willmaker plus  posted on  software that meets all needs by anonymous i owned a previous version of this software which i purchased in  the  version was a ms dos version not working on apple os i own a mac book pro and up until  there was no good alternative as my old software was not compatible now with the  version it works on both
