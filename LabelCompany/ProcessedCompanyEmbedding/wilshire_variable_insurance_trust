insurance products division of investment management at   supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained for a fee from the secs public reference branch  f street ne washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the trust is registered with the commission as an openend management investment company and is organized as a delaware statutory trust wilshire a california corporation is registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended and serves as the investment adviser to the trust the trust currently consists of and offers shares of beneficial interest “shares” representing interests in fourteen separate investment portfolios each a “portfolio” and collectively the “portfolios” the trust or any future trusts may offer one or more additional investment portfolios in the future also referred to as “portfolios”  shares of the portfolios will be offered to separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies each a “participating insurance company” as investment vehicles to fund variable contracts these separate accounts will be registered as investment companies under the  act or will be exempt from such registration individually a “separate account” and collectively the “separate accounts” shares of the portfolios may also be offered to qualified plans wilshire entities and general accounts  the participating insurance companies at the time of their investment in the trusts either have established or will establish their own separate accounts and have designed or will design their own variable contracts each participating insurance company has or will have the legal obligation of satisfying all applicable requirements under both state and federal law each participating insurance company on behalf of its separate accounts has entered or will enter into an agreement with the trusts concerning such participating insurance companys participation in the portfolios the role of the trusts under this agreement insofar as the federal securities laws are applicable will consist of among other things offering shares of the portfolios to the participating separate accounts and complying with any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein applicants legal analysis  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered as a unit investment trust “uit” under the  act rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any uit if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares rule eb provides that these exemptions apply only where all of the assets of the uit are shares of management investment companies “which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company” therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or any other affiliated insurance company the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding”  the relief granted by rule eb also is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity andor variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding”  the relief under rule eb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans or other eligible holders of shares as described above applicants note that if shares of the portfolios are sold only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule e would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to qualified plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to qualified plans the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity and variable life separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies and for qualified plans is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding”  in connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a uit rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule etb are available only where all the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies that offer to sell their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance companies offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company or start printed page which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account” therefore rule etb permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding  the relief under rule et is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company and additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans or other eligible holders of shares as described above applicants note that if shares of the portfolios were sold only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule etb would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to qualified plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to qualified plans  applicants maintain as discussed below that there is no policy reason for the sale of the portfolios shares to qualified plans to wilshire entities or general accounts to result in a prohibition against or otherwise limit a participating insurance company from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb however because the relief under rules eb and etb is available only when shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares of the portfolios are also to be sold to qualified plans wilshire entities or general accounts applicants therefore request relief in order to have the participating insurance companies enjoy the benefits of the relief granted in rules eb and etb applicants note that if the portfolios shares were to be sold only to qualified plans wilshire entities or general accounts andor separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts exemptive relief under rule e and rule et would be unnecessary the relief provided for under rules eb and etb does not relate to qualified plans wilshire entities or general accounts or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such purchasers  section a of the  act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the  act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying management company  the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the  act recognizes that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to individuals in a large insurance company complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the trusts those individuals who participate in the management of the trusts will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or qualified plans invest in the trusts applying the monitoring requirements of section a of the  act because of investment by separate accounts of other insurers or qualified plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et respectively under the  act rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in an underlying funds investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic respectively of rules e and et under the  act  rule e under the  act recognizes that a variable life insurance contract as an insurance contract has important elements unique to insurance contracts and is subject to extensive state regulation of insurance in adopting rule ebiii the commission expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters the commission also expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority to require an insurer to draw from its general account to cover costs imposed upon the insurer by a change approved by contract owners over the insurers objection the commission therefore deemed such exemptions necessary to assure the life insurers solvency and performance of its contractual obligations by enabling an insurance regulatory authority or the life insurer to act when certain proposals reasonably could be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer in this respect flexible premium variable life insurance contracts are identical to scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts therefore the corresponding provisions of rule et under the  act undoubtedly were adopted in recognition of the same factors  the sale of portfolio shares to qualified plans wilshire entities and general accounts will not have any impact on the relief requested herein with respect to the qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to qualified plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with qualified plan assets to certain specified persons under section a of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” shares of a portfolio of a fund sold to a qualified plan must be held by the trustees of the qualified plan section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the qualified plan with two exceptions i when the qualified plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan and not contrary to start printed page erisa and ii when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the qualified plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the above two exceptions stated in section a applies qualified plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies  where a named fiduciary to a qualified plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary the qualified plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the qualified plans in their discretion some of the qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants similarly wilshire entities and general accounts are not subject to any passthrough voting requirements accordingly unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with qualified plans wilshire entities or general accounts  where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions the trustee or named fiduciary has responsibility to vote the shares held by the qualified plan in this circumstance the trustee has a fiduciary duty to vote the shares in the best interest of the qualified plan participants accordingly even if wilshire or an affiliate of wilshire were to serve in the capacity of trustee or named fiduciary with voting responsibilities wilshire or its affiliate would have a fiduciary duty to vote those shares in the best interest of the qualified plan participants  in addition even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in a portfolio applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such portfolio to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in a portfolio by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed funding or shared funding qualified plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants see no reason to believe that participants in qualified plans generally or those in a particular qualified plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other qualified plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract holders the purchase of shares of portfolios by qualified plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb under the  act permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators then the affected insurer will be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the affected trust this requirement will be provided for in agreements that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with respect to their participation in the relevant portfolio  rules eb and etb under the  act give the insurance company the right to disregard the voting instructions of the contract owners in certain circumstances affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et under the  act that the insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific goodfaith determinations  a participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the majority of contract owners voting instructions the participating insurance companys action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other insurers including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance companys may be required at the affected trusts election to withdraw its separate accounts investment in such portfolio no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the agreements entered into with respect to participation by the participating insurance companies in each portfolio  each portfolio will be managed to attempt to achieve the investment objective or objectives of such portfolio and not to favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance product there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of contracts including the “minimum death benefit” guarantee under certain variable life insurance contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types of variable contracts to the extent that the degree of risk may differ as between variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies the different insurance charges imposed in effect adjust any such differences and equalize the insurers exposure in either case  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares of the portfolios to qualified plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners moreover in considering the appropriateness of the requested relief applicants have analyzed the following issues to assure themselves that there start printed page were either no conflicts of interest or that there existed the ability by the affected parties to resolve the issues without harm to the contract owners in the separate accounts or to the participants under the qualified plans  applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the internal revnue code of l as amended the “code” the regulations issued by the treasury department the “regulations” or the revenue rulings issued by the internal revenue service the “revenue rulings” if qualified plans variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same underlying fund section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable contracts held in an underlying mutual fund the code provides that a variable contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance as applicable for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department adequately diversified  regulations issued under section h provide that in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the regulations contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of such shares also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts thus the regulations specifically permit “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund for this reason applicants have concluded that neither the code nor regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if the qualified plans and separate accounts all invest in the same portfolio  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and qualified plans are taxed these differences will have no impact on the trusts when distributions are to be made and a separate account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions the separate account and qualified plan will redeem shares of the relevant portfolio at their respective net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of its variable contract and a qualified plan then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan  in connection with any meeting of shareholders the soliciting trust will inform each shareholder including each separate account qualified plan wilshire entities and general account of information necessary for the meeting including their respective share of ownership in the relevant portfolio each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions in accordance with rules e and et as applicable and its agreement with the trusts concerning participation in the relevant portfolio shares of a portfolio that are held by wilshire entities and any general account will be voted in the same proportion as all variable contract owners having voting rights with respect to that portfolio however wilshire entities and any general account will vote their shares in such other manner as the commission may require shares held by qualified plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of a portfolio would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the affected trust to withdraw its investment in such portfolio and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants reviewed whether a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act is created with respect to any variable contract owner as opposed to a participant under a qualified plan wilshire entities or a general account applicants concluded that the ability of the trusts to sell shares of their portfolios directly to qualified plans wilshire entities or a general account does not create a senior security “senior security” is defined under section g of the  act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under qualified plans or contract owners under variable contracts the qualified plans wilshire entities general accounts and the separate accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the portfolio they only can redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a portfolio has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends applicants conditions applicants and the wilshire entities agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the trust as well as any future trust that relies on the order  a majority of the board of trustees the “board” of the trust will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the trust as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule  the board will monitor the trust for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contract owners of all separate accounts and participants of all qualified plans investing in such trust and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretative letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of such trust are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners variable life insurance start printed page contract owners and trustees of the qualified plans f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a qualified plan to disregard the voting instructions of qualified plan participants  participating insurance companies on their own behalf as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in a portfolio wilshire entities and any qualified plan that executes a participation agreement upon becoming an owner of  percent or more of the assets of any portfolio collectively “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board participants will be responsible for assisting the board in

selects subadvisers wilshire will determine the allocation of each fund’s assets among those selected subadvisers wilshire selects subadvisers based upon a due diligence process that focuses on but is not limited to a subadviser’s philosophy and process people and organization resources and performance wilshire has discretion to select retain and discharge the subadvisers with approval from the trust’s board of trustees wilshire may take these actions with respect to subadvisers at any time without shareholder approval equity fund investment objective the equity fund seeks longterm capital growth as a secondary objective the equity fund seeks conservation of principal and production of income main investment strategies the equity fund invests under normal circumstances at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities the equity fund ordinarily invests in common stocks of domestic companies these companies vary in size and operating history they may or may not be listed on a stock exchange and they may be in any industry on average the equity fund will have a valuebias generally exhibiting an average price to earnings ratio lower than and an average dividend yield higher than that of the market as measured by the sp  index the equity fund may also invest in preferred stocks additionally up to  of the equity fund’s assets may be invested in us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers including common stock preferred stock convertible securities and american depository receipts included within the definition of “domestic companies” are companies that are not incorporated in the us but have one or more of the following attributes principal place of business in the us substantial portion of income derived from activities in the us equity securities traded on a major us stock exchange or included in a recognized index of us stocks or financial statements that comply with us accounting standards thus securities of such issuers are not subject to the  limitation on securities of foreign issuers currently wilshire has retained alliancebernstein lp “alliancebernstein” new york life investment management “nylim” and pzena investment management llc “pzena” to manage the equity fund the basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below two teams are primarily responsible for overseeing alliancebernstein’s portion of the equity fund the us large cap growth portfolio oversight group and the us value investment policy group alliancebernstein’s us large cap growth is a concentrated portfolio of  to  stocks that seeks to generate its premium through superior researchdriven security selection alliancebernstein’s portfolio      management team strives to invest in companies whose growth potential appears likely to outpace market expectations usually due to a combination of unique product or service offering high barriers to entry and management’s ability to execute corporate strategy alliancebernstein’s us diversified value seeks to capture misvaluations in the largecapitalization us equity market through an investment process combining rigorous fundamental research with quantitative analysis and disciplined risk control alliancebernstein’s us diversified value invests in approximately  companies overweighting those that are trading at significant discounts to their longterm earnings power as determined by alliancebernstein’s analysts us diversified value portfolios can be managed to closely track either the sp  or russell  value index over full market cycles nylim seeks to identify companies that are considered to have a high probability of outperforming the sp  index the underlying process for selecting securities is based on a quantitative process that ranks stocks based on such fundamental factors as valuation and earnings as well as on technical behavioral factors on occasion trading strategies that seek to realize returns over shorter periods may be employed the core strategy utilized by the portfolio manager includes both growth and value styles a bottomup approach which assesses the individual strengths of stocks is used to enhance returns nylim’s portion of the equity fund’s portfolio is constructed with an optimizer seeking to maximize return given a targeted tracking error and specific constraints upon completion of the analysis and review the portfolio management team enters trades in the portfolio management system creating an electronic trading blotter the blotter is immediately available electronically to the trader who is then responsible for placing the orders with various brokers the objective is to create a portfolio of securities with the most attractive return forecasts while minimizing risk relative to the benchmark the current risk controls applied to the portfolio are a maximum target tracking error of  annualized sector constraints of  and securityspecific bounds of  relative to the benchmark nylim typically engages in pricesensitive strategic trading taking care to build or liquidate positions based on the specific trading characteristics of each security the portfolio management team works closely with trading to monitor the status of outstanding trades pzena manages its allocated portion of the equity fund’s portfolio using a classic value investment philosophy pzena defines value stocks as those stocks whose prices are low relative to their longterm normal earning power pzena’s security selection process involves an initial ranking of the  largest us listed companies from the least expensive to the most expensive based upon a ratio of each company’s pricetonormalized earnings research priority is given to the least expensive stocks those exhibiting a group or sector theme and those offering portfolio diversification benefits companies undergo rigorous qualitative research by pzena’s analysts to determine whether the causes of the undervaluation are likely to be temporary or permanent third party analysis and data sources are used for about  to  of this research onsite due diligence is also an important step in pzena’s security selection determination this step occurs at the end of the research process which enables pzena to engage in a dialogue with company management from the perspective of wellinformed critical thinkers as a result of pzena’s security selection process the portion of the equity fund’s portfolio allocated to pzena will typically be highly concentrated with a strong value emphasis under normal circumstances the equity fund intends to be fully invested pending investment to meet anticipated redemption requests or as a temporary defensive measure if a subadviser determines that      market conditions warrant the equity fund may also invest without limitation in high quality us dollardenominated money market instruments the reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses however if market conditions improve this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from market upswings thus reducing the equity fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective main risks of investing because the equity fund invests most of its assets in common stocks one of the primary risks is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the stock or general economic and market conditions more information about the risks of investing in the equity fund is located in the sections entitled “more about risks” on page  and “types of investments and associated risks” on page  there can be no assurance that the equity fund will meet its investment objectives the equity fund’s investment returns will vary and you could lose money by investing in the equity fund balanced fund investment objective the balanced fund seeks to realize a high longterm total rate of return consistent with prudent investment risks total rate of return consists of current income which includes dividends interest discount accruals and capital appreciation main investment strategies the balanced fund operates under a fund of funds structure the balanced fund invests substantially all of its assets in the equity fund and income fund in addition the balanced fund may also invest in certain individual securities including money market instruments and us government securities the “main investment strategies” sections for the equity fund and income fund include descriptions of the types of stocks and bonds in which those funds are permitted to invest wilshire allocates the balanced fund’s assets between shares of the equity fund and income fund this allocation is intended to reduce the volatility of investment returns and provide the potential for higher longterm total returns than investing solely in the equity fund or income fund respectively as a matter of investment policy  to  of the balanced fund’s total assets will be invested in the equity fund and  to  of the value of its assets will be invested in the income fund under normal circumstances the balance fund’s target asset mix is  to the equity fund and  to the income fund the balanced fund’s mix of assets is regularly adjusted between the equity fund and the income fund to maintain policy targets major changes in the investment mix may occur several times within a year or over several years depending upon market and economic conditions in general however wilshire does not anticipate making frequent changes in asset allocation and will not attempt to time the market under normal circumstances the balanced fund intends to be fully invested pending investment to meet anticipated redemption requests or as a temporary defensive measure if wilshire determines that market conditions warrant the balanced fund may also invest without limitation in high quality us dollardenominated money market instruments the reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses however if market conditions improve this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from market upswings thus reducing the balanced fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective      an investor in the balanced fund should understand that alternatively he or she could allocate investments directly to the equity fund and income fund by investing indirectly in both the equity fund and the income fund through the balanced fund an investor bears not only his or her proportionate share of certain expenses of the balanced fund such as operating costs but also indirectly similar expenses of the equity fund and the income fund however shareholders of the balanced fund will not be subject to duplicative advisory or distribution b fees as a result of the fund of funds arrangement as discussed under “management” on page  main risks of investing by investing in the balanced fund an investor assumes the same types of risks either directly or indirectly as investing in both the equity fund and income fund such risks are described under the “main risks of investing” section for both the equity fund and the income fund more information about the risks of investing in the balanced fund is located in the sections entitled “more about risks” on page  and “types of investments and associated risks” on

invests under normal circumstances at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities the international equity fund invests in companies wherever organized which do business primarily outside the united states the international equity fund intends to diversify investments among several countries and to have represented in its holdings business activities in not less than three different countries the international equity fund invests primarily in equity securities of established companies that the subadvisers believe have favorable characteristics and that are listed on foreign exchanges the international equity fund may also invest in fixedincome securities of foreign governments and companies currently wilshire has retained panagora asset management inc “panagora” and thomas white international ltd “thomas white” to manage the international equity fund the basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below panagora’s passive international equity strategy seeks to reproduce the total return of the msci eafe index panagora uses a global risk model and optimization software for the management of passive msci eafe portfolios this risk model seeks to explain the correlation of security returns based upon factors which impact most securities the risk model includes factors such as sector exposure currency exposure dividend yield capitalization size sensitivity to interest rate changes the impact of oil price changes and other factors the optimization process seeks to match the sensitivity of panagora’s portion of the international equity fund’s portfolio to these factors to the sensitivity of the benchmark msci eafe to these factors the optimization process also allows panagora to manage its portion of the international equity fund portfolio’s expected tracking error while taking into consideration the size of the portfolio expected cash flows trading costs and custody charges panagora’s portfolio managers monitor their portion of the international equity fund’s portfolio daily and rebalance it as often as necessary to ensure the desired level of tracking error based on its research thomas white seeks to buy equity securities of companies at a market price that is under valued this strategy is intended to produce a portfolio with lower pricetoearnings and pricetobook ratios than other mutual funds such portfolio characteristics are typical of what are commonly referred to as “value” funds      companies considered attractive typically will have one or more of the following characteristics     •   the market price of their equity securities is undervalued relative to earnings power breakup value and inherent profitability     •   the companies are or may soon be exhibiting improved financial characteristics represented by rising cash flow return on equity operating margins and book value     •   the price of their equities may have recently underperformed the general market due to a low level of investor expectations regarding the earnings outlook     •   the companies should have the strength to operate successfully through adverse business conditions this approach seeks out equities where current investor enthusiasm is low positions are normally sold when the investment community’s perceptions improve and the securities approach a market price that thomas white believes to be fair value thomas white adheres to a longterm investment approach and it does not attempt to predict shortterm changes in the general market under normal market conditions thomas white intends to invest in companies for holding periods greater than one year so the frequency of its purchases and sales generally should be below many comparable mutual funds lower portfolio turnover helps to reduce trading costs and shareholders’ taxes a high exposure to the equity market is normally maintained unless thomas white is unable to find undervalued securities that meet its criteria using this investment management style thomas white seeks strong longterm performance below average return volatility and portfolio resilience in difficult market environments the international equity fund has no present intention of altering its general policy of being primarily invested in foreign securities under normal conditions however in the event of exceptional conditions abroad the international equity fund may temporarily invest all or a portion of its assets in canadian or us government obligations or currencies or securities of companies incorporated in and having their principal activities in canada or the united states the reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses however if market conditions improve this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market thus reducing the international equity fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective for hedging purposes the international equity fund may purchase forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options and futures contracts and foreign currencies in the form of bank deposits the international equity fund may also purchase other foreign money market instruments including but not limited to bankers’ acceptances certificates of deposit commercial paper shortterm government and corporate obligations and repurchase agreements main risks of investing because the international equity fund invests most of its assets in common stocks the primary risk is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of those companies or market and economic conditions foreign investments often involve additional risks including political instability differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets these risks are magnified in lessestablished emerging markets because the securities held by the international equity fund usually will be denominated in currencies other than      the us dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the value of the international equity fund’s investments in addition the international equity fund may invest in the securities of small companies which may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of large companies more information about the risks of investing in the international equity fund is located in the sections entitled “more about risks” on page  and “types of investments and associated risks” on page  there can be no assurance that the international equity fund will meet its investment objective the international equity fund’s investment returns will vary and you could lose money by investing in the international equity fund socially responsible fund investment objective the socially responsible fund seeks longterm growth of capital current income and growth of income main investment strategies the socially responsible fund pursues its objective through a diversified portfolio composed primarily of marketable equity securities including common stocks preferred stocks and debt securities convertible into common stocks of seasoned ustraded companies the socially responsible fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in issuers that meet certain socially responsible criteria investments in equity securities are limited to issuers which in the subadviser’s judgment meet the following criteria     •   do not produce tobacco products     •   do not produce alcoholic beverages     •   do not own andor operate casinos or manufacture gaming devices     •   do not produce pornographic materials     •   do not produce nuclear weapons or guidance andor delivery systems specifically for nuclear weapons     •   by popular standards maintain nondiscriminatory employment practices throughout a company’s facilities and     •   by popular standards maintain environmental policies practices and procedures that are currently acceptable or that are exhibiting improvement currently wilshire has retained alliancebernstein to manage the socially responsible fund the basic investment philosophy of alliancebernstein is described below alliancebernstein uses traditional methods of stock selection — research and analysis — to identify undervalued stocks that meet the socially responsible screening criteria alliancebernstein will review the socially responsible fund’s investment universe quarterly for purposes of adding or eliminating stocks that meet or fail to meet the socially responsible screening criteria all stocks purchased by the socially responsible fund will meet such criteria at the time of purchase stocks held by the socially responsible fund may be divested prior to reaching fair value as determined by alliancebernstein if during the quarterly review of the socially responsible fund’s investment universe alliancebernstein determines that a stock no longer meets the socially responsible screening criteria the portfolio will consist      primarily of stocks with market capitalizations greater than  billion in addition alliancebernstein employs quantitative valuation tools to identify attractive stocks and the most opportune time to purchase them in addition from time to time for temporary defensive purposes when alliancebernstein determines such a position is advisable in light of economic or market conditions the socially responsible fund may invest a portion of its assets in cash and cash equivalents pending investment to meet anticipated redemption requests or as a temporary defensive measure if alliancebernstein determines that market conditions warrant the socially responsible fund may also invest without limitation in high quality us dollardenominated money market instruments the reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses however if market conditions improve this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market thus reducing the socially responsible fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective main risks of investing the socially responsible fund only invests in companies that meet its criteria for socially responsible investing because of this restriction the investments that alliancebernstein may choose from may be more limited than those of a fund that is not restricted to investing in companies that meet social criteria as a result alliancebernstein may pass up opportunities to buy certain securities when it is otherwise advantageous to so do or may sell certain securities when it is otherwise disadvantageous to do so in addition investing in socially responsible companies may result in the socially responsible fund investing more or less in a specific sector of the economy relative to its benchmark since the socially responsible fund invests most of its assets in common stocks one of the primary risks is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the stock or general economic and market conditions more information about the risks of investing in the socially responsible fund is located in the sections entitled “more about risks” on page  and “types of investments and associated risks” on page  there can be no assurance that the socially

negatively affect an investment adverse changes in exchange rates may erode or reverse any gains produced by foreign currency denominated investments and may widen any losses derivatives risk when a fund uses derivatives securities whose value is based upon the value of another security or an index to hedge positions in the portfolio any loss generated by the derivative security should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment and vice versa while hedging can reduce or eliminate losses it can also reduce or eliminate gains to the extent that a derivative is not used as a hedge ie for speculation a fund is directly exposed to the potential gains and losses of that derivative gains and losses from nonhedging derivative positions may be substantially greater than the derivative’s original cost      credit risk for debt securities credit risk is the possibility that an issuer or counterparty to a contract will fail to make timely payments of interest or principal to a fund the credit risk of a fund depends on the credit quality of its underlying securities in general for debt securities the lower the credit quality of a fund’s securities the higher a fund’s risk all other factors such as maturity being equal interest rate risk for debt securities interest rate risk is the possibility that the price will fall because of changing interest rates in general debt securities’ prices rise or fall inversely to changes in interest rates if interest rates rise bond prices generally fall if interest rates fall bond prices generally rise in addition for a given change in interest rates longermaturity bonds fluctuate more in price gaining or losing more in value than shortermaturity bonds investment style risk during certain market conditions a fund with a more specific investment style such as value or growth may perform less well than a fund that allows greater flexibility in the investment of assets liquidity risk a fund may invest in certain securities that may be difficult or impossible to sell at a certain time and at a price that a fund finds to be favorable a fund may have to accept an unfavorable price sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on portfolio management or investment performance market risk for equity securities stock market movements will affect a fund’s share price on a daily basis declines in value are possible because of declines in the stock market in general or because of a decline in the specific securities held by a fund there is also the possibility that the price of the security will fall because the market perceives that there is or will be a deterioration in the fundamental value of the issuer or poor earnings performance by the issuer market risk may affect a single company industry sector or the market as a whole for debt securities the market value of a security may move up and down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer an industry a sector or the bond market as a whole portfolio strategy risk the investment performance of a fund is in part dependent upon either wilshire’s or a subadviser’s skill in making appropriate investments to the extent that a fund’s investments differ from the portfolio represented by the benchmark there exists the potential for volatility of the return of a fund relative to its index as the industry and sector composition of the market or index changes over time the implementation of a fund’s strategy can lead to substantial differences in the sector or industry allocation of a fund relative to the market or index prepayment risk mortgagebacked securities are subject to the risk of unanticipated prepayments of principal with respect to mortgages in the security’s underlying pool of assets while principal prepayments are passed through to the holders of the securities prepayments also reduce the future payments on such securities and may reduce their value mortgagebacked securities are subject to the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates will extend the life of a mortgagebacked security beyond the expected prepayment time typically reducing the security’s value mortgagebacked securities are subject to the risk that an unexpected decline in interest rates will contract the life of a mortgagebacked security thereby affecting its prepayment schedule which may affect the value of the security reinvestment risk during periods of falling interest rates a debt security with a high stated interest rate may be prepaid or “called” prior to its expected maturity date if during periods of falling interest rates a debt security with a high stated interest rate is called the unanticipated proceeds would likely be      invested at lower interest rates and a fund’s income or yield may decline call provisions which may lead to reinvestment risk are most common for intermediate and longterm municipal corporate and mortgagebacked securities to the extent securities subject to call were acquired at a premium the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited and may even result in losses turnover risk a fund that trades aggressively will experience high portfolio turnover and relatively high brokerage and other transaction costs such transaction costs may lower a fund’s effective investment return valuation risk a fund may invest in securities that are difficult to value and may inadvertently value certain of its securities at a higher price than the market will bear      types of investments and associated risks shareholders of each of the equity fund income fund small cap growth fund and international equity fund will be provided with at least  days

adrs adrs typically are issued by an american bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation edrs which are sometimes referred to as continental depository receipts are receipts issued in europe typically by foreign banks and trust companies that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities gdrs are depository receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis unsponsored adr edr and gdr programs are organized independently and without the cooperation of the issuer of the underlying securities as a result available information concerning the issuer may not be as current as for sponsored adrs edrs and gdrs and the prices of unsponsored adrs edrs and gdrs may be more volatile than if such instruments were sponsored by the issuer investments in adrs edrs and gdrs present additional investment considerations as described below under “foreign securities” foreign securities the equity fund international equity fund small cap growth fund socially responsible fund income fund and shortterm investment fund may invest in foreign securities investing outside the united states involves economic and political considerations not typically applicable to us markets these considerations which may favorably or unfavorably affect a fund’s investment performance include but are not limited to changes in exchange rates and exchange rate controls which may include suspension of the ability to transfer currency from a given country costs incurred in conversions between currencies nonnegotiable brokerage commissions different accounting standards lower trading volume and greater market volatility the difficulty of enforcing obligations in other countries less securities regulation different tax provisions including withholding on interest and dividends paid to a fund war expropriation political and social instability and diplomatic developments further the settlement period of securities transactions in foreign markets may be longer than in domestic markets these considerations generally are heightened in developing countries for example the possibility of political upheaval and the dependence on foreign economic assistance may be greater in these countries than in developed countries wilshire and the subadvisers seek to mitigate the risks associated with these considerations through diversification and active professional management for a more detailed description of foreign securities see the sai of the trust forward foreign and currency exchange contracts the international equity fund may invest in foreign currencies the income fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts      “forward contracts” up to  of the value of its total net assets for hedging purposes only a forward contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed price at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract the agreed price may be fixed or within a specified range of prices the income fund also may enter into foreign currency futures contracts and foreign currency options up to  of the value of total net assets for hedging purposes only foreign currency futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on commodities exchanges that involve an obligation to purchase or sell a predetermined amount of currency at a predetermined date at a specified price for a more detailed description of foreign currencies see the sai of the trust highyield highrisk securities the income fund may invest in fixed income or convertible securities rated lower than “baa” by moody’s or “bbb” by sp or unrated securities of comparable quality which are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” or “highyieldhighrisk” securities these securities are considered speculative and generally involve a higher risk of loss of principal and income than higherrated investment grade securities the value of these securities generally fluctuates more than those of higherrated securities the value of highyield highrisk securities may also be influenced by the bond market’s perception of an issuer’s credit quality or its outlook for economic growth as with any other asset in a fund’s portfolio any reduction in the value of such securities would be reflected in the net asset value of a fund in addition a fund that invests in lowerquality securities may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal and interest on its holdings as a result of the associated risks successful investments in highyield highrisk securities will be more dependent on wilshire’s and the subadvisers’ credit analysis than generally would be the case with investments in investment grade securities lowerquality securities tend to be less liquid than higherquality debt securities because the market for them is not as broad or active the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on market price and a fund’s ability to sell particular securities for a description of ratings and a more detailed description of highyield highrisk securities see the sai of the trust illiquid securities the income fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities that are illiquid variable and floating rate instruments that cannot be disposed of within seven days and repurchase agreements and time deposits that do not provide for payment within seven days after notice without taking a reduced price are subject to these limits each of the small cap growth fund international equity fund and socially responsible fund may invest up to  of its net assets in illiquid securities including repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days each of the balanced fund and income fund may invest up to  of its net assets in illiquid securities and may not invest in “restricted

securities act of  the “ act” but which can be sold to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with rule a under the  act if they are determined to be liquid any such security will be considered liquid so long as it is determined by a subadviser that an adequate trading market exists for that security this investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in a fund during any period that qualified institutional buyers become uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities as a matter of operating policy each fund will invest only in rule a securities that are deemed to be liquid and will limit its investment in rule a securities to  of its net assets the equity fund and shortterm investment fund may not invest in illiquid or restricted securities or securities not fully marketable      mortgage and assetbacked securities the income fund may invest in mortgage and assetbacked securities which represent shares in a pool of mortgages or other debt these securities are generally passthrough securities which means that principal and interest payments on the underlying securities less servicing fees are passed through to shareholders on a pro rata basis these securities involve prepayment risk which is the risk that the underlying mortgages or other debt may be refinanced or paid off before they mature particularly during periods of declining interest rates in that case a subadviser may need to reinvest the proceeds from the securities at a lower interest rate this could lower a fund’s return and result in losses to a fund if some securities were acquired at a premium potential market gains on a security subject to prepayment risk may be more limited than potential market gains on a comparable security that is not subject to prepayment risk the income fund may also invest in collateralized mortgage obligations “cmos” in a cmo a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes which have varying levels of risks for a more detailed description of mortgage and assetbacked securities see the sai of the trust adjustable rate mortgage securities the income fund may invest in adjustable

subadviser of the funds and to the extent it deems appropriate to achieve the funds’ investment objectives reallocates assets among individual subadvisers or recommends the employment or termination of particular subadvisers pursuant to an exemptive order from the securities and exchange commission “sec” wilshire without shareholder approval as normally would be required under the  act may replace add or remove subadvisers and enter into subadvisory agreements with these subadvisers upon approval of the board of trustees within  days of the hiring of any new subadviser or the implementation of any proposed material change to a subadvisory agreement shareholders will be furnished with an information statement that contains all information that would be included in a proxy statement regarding the new subadviser or subadvisory agreement except as modified by exemptive relief moreover wilshire will not enter into a subadvisory agreement with any subadviser that is an “affiliated person” as defined in the  act of the trust or wilshire other than by reason of serving as a subadviser to one or more of the funds without shareholder approval in addition whenever a subadviser is hired or fired wilshire will provide the board of trustees with information showing the expected impact on wilshire’s profitability and will report such impact quarterly      each subadviser’s fees will be paid by wilshire out of the advisory fees that wilshire receives from each of the funds for a fund with multiple subadvisers the fees paid to a subadviser will depend upon the fee rate negotiated with wilshire and upon the percentage of the fund’s assets allocated to that subadviser by wilshire which may vary from time to time thus the basis for fees paid to any such subadviser will not be constant and the relative amounts of fees paid to the various subadvisers of a fund will fluctuate these internal fluctuations however will not affect the total advisory fees paid by a fund which will remain fixed based on the terms described above wilshire may however determine in its discretion to waive a portion of its fee if internal fluctuations in the fee to be paid to the subadvisers results in excess profit to wilshire because wilshire will pay each subadviser’s fees out of its own fees from the funds there will not be any “duplication” of advisory fees paid by the funds shareholders should recognize however that in engaging new subadvisers and entering into subadvisory agreements wilshire will negotiate fees with those subadvisers and because these fees are paid by wilshire and not directly by each fund any fee reduction negotiated by wilshire may inure to wilshire’s benefit and any increase may inure to its detriment however wilshire has agreed to waive its fee to the extent any fee reduction is negotiated with a subadviser for the small cap growth fund and international equity fund in addition wilshire has agreed to waive its fee and reimburse the shortterm investment fund for all expenses except for custodian and trustees’ fees through december   the fees paid to wilshire by the funds and the fees paid to the subadvisers by wilshire are considered by the board of trustees in approving the funds’ advisory and subadvisory arrangements any change in the advisory fees paid by a fund to wilshire would require shareholder approval

annuity contracts the funds have a verification process for new insurance company accounts to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities federal law requires all financial institutions including the funds to obtain verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account when an insurance company opens an account the funds will ask for its name address and other information that will allow the funds to identify the company this information will be verified to ensure the identity of all persons opening an account for certain insurance companies the funds might request additional information for instance the funds would ask for documents such as the insurance company’s articles of incorporation to help verify the insurance company’s identity the funds will not complete the purchase of any fund shares for an account until all required and requested identification information has been provided and the application has been submitted in proper      order once the application is determined to be in proper order fund purchases will be effected at the net asset value per share next calculated the funds may reject a new

the account is being used for fraudulent or illegal purposes by the insurance company or by the variable annuity contract owner one or more of these actions will be taken when at the sole discretion of the funds they are deemed to be in a fund’s best interest or when a fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental authority or by applicable law the funds may close and liquidate an

liability shortterm and excessive trading — the trust and its funds are designed for longterm investors the funds do not accommodate shortterm or excessive trading and ask the insurance companies that offer the funds for cooperation in discouraging such trading activity through their variable annuity contracts such trading may present risks to other shareholders in a fund including disruption of portfolio investment strategies with potential resulting harm to investment performance and increased trading costs or fund expenses thus such trading may negatively impact a fund’s net asset value and result in dilution to longterm shareholders in an effort to protect longterm shareholders the board of trustees has adopted policies and procedures which seek to deter shortterm and excessive trading shares of the funds are only held as the underlying investment for variable annuity contracts issued by insurance companies and as a result the participating insurance companies rather than the underlying contract owners are the shareholders of the funds the trust is limited in its ability to enforce the trust’s market timing trading policy because each insurance company has the relationship with and is responsible for maintaining the account records of the individual variable annuity contract owners in addition there may be legal and technical limitations on the ability of an insurance company to impose trading restrictions and to apply the trust’s market timing trading policy to their variable annuity contract owners as a result should it occur there is no assurance that the trust will be completely successful in its effort to detect or minimize market timing activity dividends distributions and federal taxes each fund distributes substantially all of its net investment income and net capital gains to shareholders each year all dividends or distributions paid on fund shares held by a separate account net of separate account contract charges are

the shareholder whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares when new shares are added to an equity fund public shareholder’s account through the reinvestment of dividends or when distributions occur a confirmation statement is sent to the public shareholder showing the number of shares that were credited to the account the net asset value per share and the total number of shares in the account a dividend or capital gain distribution will reduce the per share net asset value by the amount of the dividend or distribution shortly after the end of each year equity fund shareholders will be informed of the amount of and the federal income tax treatment of all distributions made during the year if not otherwise subject to tax on their income public shareholders will not be required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them shareholders must determine for themselves the applicability of state and local taxes to dividends and distributions received on equity fund

wilshire�s proposed subadvisory agreements with nylim pzena and allianceberstein the �agreements� the board evaluated information provided by wilshire and nlim pzena and alliancebernstein in accordance with section�c of the investment company act of  as amended the � act� in reviewing the agreements the board considered i�the nature extent and quality of services to be provided under each agreement the board considered the reputation qualifications and background of the subadvisers investment approach of the subadvisers and the experience and skills of investment personnel responsible for the daytoday management of the equity fund based upon all relevant factors the board concluded that each subadviser�s investment performance for a product similar to the equity fund met or exceeded acceptable levels of investment performance as compared to a relevant market benchmark and therefore was satisfactory the board also considered the proposed subadvisory fees to be paid by wilshire to each subadviser the board evaluated the competitiveness of the subadvisory fees based upon data supplied by alliancebernstein and nylim about the fees charged to other clients the board noted the favorable treatment to be afforded the equity fund in applying the breakpoints in pzena�s fee schedule the board also considered that the subadvisory fee rates were negotiated at arm�s length between wilshire and each subadviser and that wilshire will compensate each subadviser from its own advisory fees based upon all of the above the board determined that the proposed subadvisory fees of each subadviser were reasonable in addition the board noted that the revenues to the subadvisers will be limited due to the current asset level of the equity fund accordingly the board concluded that they need not review estimated levels of profits to the subadvisers in order to conclude as they did that profitability to the subadvisers was not unreasonable �  the board considered whether there will be economies of scale with respect to the subadvisory services provided to the equity fund and whether the subadvisory fees reflect such economies of scale through breakpoints in fees the board also considered whether the estimated effective subadvisory fee rate for each subadviser under the each agreement is reasonable in relation to the asset size of the equity fund the board concluded that the fee schedule for each subadviser reflects an appropriate recognition of any economies of scale the board also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits to be received by each subadviser the board considered each subadviser�s soft dollar practices and if applicable use of affiliated brokerage the board concluded that taking into account the benefits arising from these practices the fees to be charged under the agreement were reasonable based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached the board as a whole and the trustees who are not �interested persons� of the trust as defined in the  act the �independent trustees� separately determined that the fees under each agreement were fair and reasonable for the services to be provided and that the approval of each agreement is in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders in deciding to approve the agreement the board did not identify a single factor as controlling but concluded that each of the various factors referred to above favored approval nylim nylim located at  madison avenue new york ny  had approximately  billion in assets under management

personnel responsible for the daytoday management of each fund the board also considered each subadviser�s compliance program in addition the board considered wilshire�s recommendation that each subadvisory agreement be approved based upon all relevant factors the board concluded that copper rock�s investment performance for a product similar to the small cap growth fund met or exceeded acceptable levels of investment performance as compared to a relevant market benchmark and therefore a satisfactory level of services was anticipated the board noted panagora�s representation that it does not currently manage a product using the same investment strategy as will be employed for the international equity fund but concluded that based upon panagora�s investment performance for other

but based upon review of the organization and personnel concluded that a satisfactory level of services was anticipated the board considered the proposed subadvisory fees of each subadviser where applicable the board evaluated the competitiveness of the subadvisory fees based upon data supplied by each subadviser about the fees charged to other clients the board also considered that the

other clients the board concluded that the fees charged to wilshire were generally competitive based upon all of the above the board determined that the proposed subadvisory fees of each subadviser

addition the board noted that the revenues to the various subadvisers will be limited due to the size of the funds based upon this information profitability to the subadvisers was determined to be not unreasonable the board considered whether there will be economies of scale with respect to the subadvisory services to be provided to each fund and whether the subadvisory fees reflect such economies of scale through breakpoints in fees the board also considered whether the estimated effective subadvisory fee rate for each subadviser under each agreement is reasonable in relation to the asset size of the fund the board concluded that the fee schedule for each subadviser reflects an appropriate recognition of any economies of scale �  the board also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits received by each subadviser the board considered each subadviser�s soft dollar practices where applicable the board concluded that taking into account the benefits arising from these practices the fees to be charged under each subadvisory agreement were reasonable based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached the board determined that the terms of each subadvisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that the approval of each subadvisory agreement is in the best interests of each fund bny bny a new york corporation is located at  broadway th
