commentaryproduct tanker spot earnings modestly weakened in the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  but remained at overall robust levels the decline was mainly driven by lower rates on the transatlantic trade as the lack of arbitrage opportunities and decreased european refinery throughputs limited product shipments from europe to the east coast of the united states the market improved considerably in the second part of the quarter on the back of surging exports from the gulf of mexico and a rise in activity on the transatlantic route overall average sport earnings for mr product tankers in  reached their highest level since  as the continuous strong exports from the us gulf to latin america europe and west africa along with stronger rates in the eastern hemisphere and a firm rate environment on the transatlantic trade observed during the first half of the year combined to push rates higherthe product tanker period market experienced increased activity in the fourth quarter and throughout  in response to the strengthening spot rate environment and the positive outlook for the sector while period rates rose to the highest levels since july  the number of period fixtures for product tankers in  is estimated to have reached their highest level on record we expect the positive development in the product tanker market to continue in  on the back of stronger oil demand growth rising exports from the us gulf and favorable changes in the refinery landscapeon the supply side the product tanker order book continued to experience slippage during  as approximately  of the expected mr and handy size tanker newbuildings were not delivered on schedule analysts expect that net fleet growth for product tankers for  will be in the region of  while overall demand for product tankers for the year is estimated to grow at the suezmax spot market improved significantly in the fourth quarter supported by seasonally stronger demand along with increased longhaul crude movements from west africa and the atlantic basin to the far east and delays in the turkish straits for the year average suezmax spot earnings remained at historically low levels as excess tonnage availability counterbalanced the increased demand observed in  the period charter rates as well as the number of period fixtures in the suezmax sector remained at historically depressed levels in slippage for the suezmax tanker order book continues to affect tonnage supply as approximately  of the expected crude newbuildings were not delivered on schedule suezmax tanker demand is expected to

ioannis lazaridis chief executive and chief financial officer of the partnerships general partner commentedwe are very pleased to see the improved operating surplus of the partnership for the fourth quarter  which reflects the full quarterly contribution of the three additional  teu container vessels with  year period charters that we acquired in september  overall we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during  to grow the partnership by increasing our fleet by a total of five container vessels each with long term period coverage as well as replacing one  built product tanker with a  built eco type mr product tanker with increased earnings capacity moreover we have secured a loan facility which we recently upsized to  million which will further allow us to continue to pursue growth for the partnershipimportantly the product tanker market continued to improve throughout  with solid period fixture activity on the back of an improving spot market following continuous growth of us exports of refined products and refinery capacity dislocation thus allowing the partnership to employ its product tankers at increased period ratesmr lazaridis concluded i would like to
