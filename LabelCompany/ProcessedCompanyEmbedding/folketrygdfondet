government pension fund norway and the government bond fund within tight regional constraintsfolketrygdfondet which manages the government pension fund  norway and the government bond fund with combined assets of nokbn €bn on behalf of the countrys ministry of finance is the quiet sibling of the government pension fund global which because of its size and international profile often hogs the limelight as at  june  the domestically focused fund had nokbn €bn in assets under management which are mainly invested in norwegian equities and bonds however capital can also be invested in shares listed in norway denmark finland and sweden and in fixed income instruments where the issuer is domiciled in these countries according to olaug svarva the managing director of the fund at the end of june the fund invested  in equities out of which  is invested in norway and the rest in denmark finland and sweden with  invested in fixed income with the same division between norwegian and other nordic countries the governement pension fund  norway like the global fund was set up to support governmental savings for financing future national insurance pension fund expenditures whereas the government bond fund aims to increase liquidity and capital inflow in the norwegian credit bond market the bond fund was established in march  with a capital of nokbnfolketrygdfondet manages all the assets inhouse with a staff of  and there are no plans to outsource the assets svarva says there is no reason to look for external mangers as the team has built up extensive internal capabilities to cover the nordic markets over the past  years currently folketrydgfondet is reviewing its active management arrangements prompted by the ministry of finance svarva says the fund continues to believe that active management does add value folketrygdfondet is a large investor in a relatively small market holding a  share of the market value of the oslo stock exchange and almost  of the index or benchmark svarva argues that this speaks against passive management despite recent performance dips historically we have been able to generate excess returns above benchmark with our active management so we believe strongly in it over the long term as a result of poor performance of domestic equities the fund returned  in the first half losing some nokbn in particular falls in the energy and materials sectors were detrimental to performance despite the negative returns the fund beat its benchmark index by  over the past  years the fund has had an annual return above the benchmark of  during the first half norwegian equities returned  as a result of a fall in equities towards the end of the second quarter the positive developments in denmark and sweden somewhat mitigated the domestic returns by adding  to the performance the norwegian bond portfolio returned  and the remaining nordic bonds returned  the government pension fund  norway can invest  in equities and  in fixed income between   of the equity and fixed income portfolios respectively must be invested in norway with the remainder of  to be placed in denmark finland and sweden iceland is not part of the investment universefolketrygdfondet may own up to  of the share capital or the basic capital in any single company in norway in denmark finland and sweden the fund may own shares representing up to  in any single company up to  of the capital may be invested in unlisted norwegian shares if the company has applied for or has specifically planned to apply for a listing folketrygdfondet may also retain shares in norwegian companies that change their status to become foreign companies in connection with mergers and acquisitions svarva says there are no suggestions or discussions about adding additional asset classes to the portfolio mix we already have a flexible mandate and we can use this to our advantage the ministry of finance determines the benchmark portfolio for the government pension fund and the government bond fund both of which reflect the ministrys investment strategyfolketrygdfondet is a relative return manager and its results are compared to outperformance against the benchmark determined by the ministry which also determines the limit for the prospective relative volatility of the government pension fund the limit sets the extent to which the portfolios expected returns can deviate from the benchmark portfolio returns the ministry has determined a strategic benchmark portfolio which consists of  fixed income instruments and  in equities the ministry also stipulates that the prospective relative volatility or tracking error on an annualised basis should be a maximum of  percentage pointsas part of its ethical investment principles the finance ministry may decide to exclude firms from the investment universe of folketrygdfondet  have your say you must sign in to make a comment sign in register print email share comment add to my reading
