wisdom value longterm horizon worldly wisdom growth at reasonable priceunconventional capital wisdom llcsummarytracking smallcap super investors might be more worthwhile for smaller investors than tracking largecap super investorsbares capital has been graduating to larger smallcap equitiesthe firms reduction of small and microcaps is likely due to both the graduation and also due to the nine ten partners lp transferinvestors often check the holdings of super investors but they often limit themselves to investors that focus on larger midcap or largecap companies super investors with a lot of capital to manage are restricted to those larger companies while investors with smaller amounts of capital do not have the same restrictions a continued run up in the overall market especially the larger more well known companies leaves those large super investors with an even more limited number of companies to choose from while they might have trouble finding ideas there still are s of smaller companies that go unnoticed by analysts the market and larger institutions to circumvent this investors can follow super investors that focus on microcaps and smallcap companies where there tends to be greater opportunities to find inefficiently priced quality companies even in bull markets one investor that has been restricting their assets under management to continue to invest in microcaps and smallcaps is brian bares although we do not know his firms exact performance we do know that in his first year of operation his fund returned  on  million and fourteen years later manages over a billion dollars his philosophy tends to lean towards warren buffett and charlie munger focusing on owning only a hand full of quality businesses with quality managers and allowing the company to internally compound capital at high rates since he began focusing on microcaps he essentially was finding those quality companies in their infancy and letting them compound capital at high rates the following interview gives a better idea of brian bares philosophy brian has written about the institutional investing imperative where super investors tend to start in the inefficient smallcap space and once achieving high performance they have a profit incentive to gather more assets  institutions are also more likely to invest  thus making it more difficult to continue investing in the microcap and small cap areas of the market he calls this graduating to bigger markets where there is more institutional competition and more efficient markets q portfolio changes bares capital has been able to continue to invest in the microcap space  million market cap since bares was content capping assets under management which is unusual with institutional fund managers what we have noticed however is that bares capital management looks to continuing graduation from microcaps to small caps above  million in market cap and most above  billion looking at the firms transactions in the recent quarter eight out of the eleven companies below  million in market cap saw their positions reduced intl wina reis fhco utmd oflx tlf source mkt cap from yahoo finance sec filings our calculations it is likely that these positions have been reduced less for valuation reasons and more to do with the firms graduation to larger equities since bares capital manages  billion aum and companies in the over  million market cap constitute more than  of the firms portfolio what is also notable is that in the last few months the above companies have been transferred from bares capital to nine ten partners lp which is a hedge fund directed by bares capital what is interesting is that only these smallcap companies have been listed so far under nine ten partners while the larger company holdings are yet to be listed with nine ten our educated guess is that some institutions and the partners of bares elected to continue their focus on microcaps and smaller smallcap companies as we guessed in this article the transfer is likely to have caused bares to reduce their positions potentially due to giving some capital back to some investors xpo logistics nysemktxpo is another position that was reduced in the quarter  that is well above  million  that is also included as nine tens holdings the only companies with an  million market cap that were added to were americas carmart nasdaqcrmt graham corp nysemktghm and mesa laboratories nasdaqmlab only graham corp has been listed as a nine ten holding as well positions significantly increased we exclude the many small holdings post holdings  nysepost this position was originally purchased last year in the same quarter and has grown from  of the portfolio to  bares added  or k shares during the quarter and the position is likely to have fallen as a percentage of the whole portfolio due to the recent decline in share price it is quite likely that with the high conviction bares could be adding to the position
