committee for  years holding both positions until his death in office in  daley was chicagos third consecutive mayor from the workingclass heavily irish american bridgeport neighborhood on chicagos south side where he lived his entire life daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other rust belt cities like cleveland buffalo and detroit experienced during the same period he had a strong base of support in chicagos irish catholic community and he was treated by national politicians such as lyndon b johnson as a preeminent irish american with special connections to the kennedy family daley played a major role in the history of the democratic party especially with his support of john f kennedy in  and of hubert humphrey in  daley is the father of richard m

chicago he was the only child of michael and lillian dunne daley whose families had both arrived from the old parish area near dungarvan county waterford ireland during the great famine daley would later state that his wellsprings were his religion his family his neighborhood the democratic party and his love of the city his father was a sheet metal worker with a reserved demeanor michaels father james e daley was a butcher born in new york while his mother delia gallagher daley was an irish immigrant richards mother was outgoing and outspoken before women obtained the right to vote in  lillian daley was an active suffragette participating in marches mrs daley often brought her son to them she hoped her sons life would be more professionally successful than that of his parents prior to his mothers death daley had won the democratic nomination for cook county sheriff lillian daley wanted more than this for her son telling a friend i didnt raise my son to be a policeman educationedit daley attended the elementary school of his parish nativity of our lord and de la salle institute where he learned clerical skills and took night classes at depaul university college of law to earn a juris doctor in  as a young man his jobs included selling newspapers and making deliveries for a door to door peddler daley worked in chicagos union stock yards the conditions of which were made infamous in upton sinclairs novel the jungle to pay his law school expenses he spent his free time at the hamburg athletic club an athletic social and political organization near his home hamburg and similar clubs were funded at least in part by democratic politicians daley made his mark there not in sports but in organization as the club manager at age  he was elected president of the club and served in that office until  although he practiced law with partner william j lynch he dedicated the majority of his time to his political career political careeredit early careeredit daleys career in politics began when he became a democratic precinct captain although he was a lifelong democrat daley was first elected to the illinois house of representatives as a republican in  this was a matter of political opportunism and the peculiar setup for legislative elections in illinois at the time which allowed daley to take the place on the ballot of the recently deceased republican candidate david shanahan after his election daley quickly moved back to the democratic side of the aisle in  when he was elected to the illinois state senate in  illinois state senator william botchy connors remarked you couldnt give that guy a nickel thats how honest he is daley was appointed by governor adlai stevenson as head of the illinois department of finance daley suffered his only political defeat in  when he lost a bid to become cook county sheriff daley then made a successful run for cook county clerk and held that position prior to being elected chicagos mayor in the late s daley became democratic ward committeeman of the th ward a post he retained until his death th ward democratic committee office chicago daley became chairman of the central committee of the cook county democratic party ie boss of the political machine in  holding this position along with the mayoralty in later years enhanced daleys power first elected mayor in  daley beat robert merriam by  votes to  daley was reelected to that office five times and had been mayor for  years at the time of his death through those  years the illinois license plate on his car remained   during his administration daley ruled the city with an iron hand and dominated the political arena of the city and to a lesser extent that of the entire state officially chicago has a weakmayor system in which most of the power is vested in the city council however his post as de facto leader of the chicago democratic party gave him great influence over the citys ward organizations which in turn allowed him a considerable voice in democratic primary contestsin most cases the real contest in this heavily democratic city daley met eleanor sis guilfoyle at a local ball game he courted sis for six years during which time he finished law school and was established in his legal profession they were married on june   and lived in a modest brick bungalow at  south lowe avenue in the heavily irishamerican neighborhood of bridgeport just blocks from his birthplace they had three daughters and four sons in that order their eldest son richard m daley was elected mayor of chicago in  and served in that position until his retirement in  the youngest son william m daley served as white house chief of staff under president barack obama and as us secretary of commerce under president bill clinton

place the university of illinois at chicago numerous expressways and subway construction projects and other major chicago landmarks ohare was a particular point of pride for daley with him and his staff regularly devising occasions to celebrate it daley also contributed to john f kennedys narrow  vote victory in illinois in  a pbs documentary entitled daley explained that mayor daley and jfk potentially stole the  election by stuffing ballot boxes and rigging the vote in chicagocitation needed although often quoted as fact this repeated claim is impossible kennedy won with  electoral college votes and needed only  meaning nixon would have lost even had he won illinois  votes had nixon won illinois  electoral votes he would have had  electoral votes while kennedy would have had  daley is also known for saying the cynical phrase vote early  and often he was notorious for corruption and manipulation of the democratic process  in  sclcs james bevel and martin luther king jr took the civil rights movement north and encouraged racial integration of chicagos neighborhoods such as marquette park daley called for a summit conference and signed an agreement with king and other community leaders to foster open housing the public agreement itself was without legal standing and ignored sclcs efforts in chicago contributed to the passage of the fair housing act two years later  and later careeredit jimmy carter and daley at the illinois state democratic convention in chicago illinois  daley at the opening day parade for the lakefront festival  the year  was a momentous year for daley in april daley was castigated by many for his sharp rhetoric in the aftermath of rioting that took place after martin luther king jrs assassination displeased with what he saw as an overcautious police response to the rioting daley chastised police superintendent james b conlisk and subsequently related that conversation at a city hall press conference as follows i said to him very emphatically and very definitely that an order be issued by him immediately to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a molotov cocktail in his hand because theyre potential murderers and to shoot to maim or cripple anyone looting this statement generated significant controversy daleys supporters deluged his office with grateful letters and telegrams nearly  according to time magazinecitation needed but others were appalled reverend jesse jackson for example called it a fascists response the mayor later backed away from his words in an address to the city council saying it is the established policy of the police department – fully supported by this administration – that only the minimum force necessary be used by policemen in carrying out their duties later that month daley asserted there wasnt any shoottokill order that was a fabrication in august the  democratic national convention was held in chicago intended to showcase daleys achievements to national democrats and the news media the proceedings during the convention instead garnered notoriety for the mayor and city descending into verbal outbursts on the part of politicians and a circus for the media with the nation divided by the vietnam war and with the assassinations of king and robert f kennedy earlier that year serving as backdrop the city became a battleground for antivietnam war protesters who vowed to shut down the convention in some cases confrontations between protesters and police turned violent with images of this violence broadcast on national television later antiwar activists abbie hoffman jerry rubin and three other members of the chicago seven were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent of inciting a riot as a result of these confrontations though the convictions were overturned on appeal at the convention itself sen abraham a ribicoff dconn went offscript during his speech nominating george mcgovern saying and with george mcgovern as president of the united states we wouldn’t have to have gestapo tactics in the streets of chicago and with george mcgovern as president we wouldnt have to have a national guard ribicoff with his voice shaking then said how hard it is to speak the truth when we know the problems that are facing this nation for which some in the crowd booed ribicoff ribicoff also tried to introduce a motion to shut down the convention and move it to another city many conventioneers applauded ribicoffs remarks but an indignant mayor daley tried to shout down the speaker as television cameras focused on daley lipreaders throughout america claimed to have observed him shouting fuck you you jew son of a bitch defenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling ribicoff a faker a charge denied by daley and refuted by mike roykos reporting a federal commission led by local attorney party activist dan walker investigated the events surrounding the convention and described them as a police riot daley defended his police force with the following statement which was also a slip of the tongue the confrontation was not caused by the police the confrontation was caused by those who charged the police gentlemen lets get this thing straight once and for all the policeman is not here to create disorder the policeman is here to preserve disorder public opinion polls conducted after the convention demonstrated that the majority of americans supported the mayors tactics daley was historically reelected for the fifth time in  however many have argued this was due to a lack of formidable opposition rather than daleys

career political careeredit early careeredit daleys career in politics began when he became a democratic precinct captain although he was a lifelong democrat daley was first elected to the illinois house of representatives as a republican in  this was a matter of political opportunism and the peculiar setup for legislative elections in illinois at the time which allowed daley to take the place on the ballot of the recently deceased republican candidate david shanahan after his election daley quickly moved back to the democratic side of the aisle in  when he was elected to the illinois state senate in  illinois state senator william botchy connors remarked you couldnt give that guy a nickel thats how honest he is daley was appointed by governor adlai stevenson as head of the illinois

plate on his car remained   during his administration daley ruled the city with an iron hand and dominated the political arena of the city and to a lesser extent that of the entire state officially chicago has a weakmayor system in which most of the power is vested in the city council however his post as de facto leader of the chicago democratic party gave him great influence over the citys ward organizations which in turn allowed him a considerable voice in democratic primary contestsin most cases the real contest in this heavily democratic city daley met eleanor sis guilfoyle at a local ball game he courted sis for six years during which time he finished law school and was established in his legal profession they were married on june   and lived in a modest brick bungalow at  south

airport the sears tower mccormick place the university of illinois at chicago numerous expressways and subway construction projects and other major chicago landmarks ohare was a particular point of pride for daley with him and his staff regularly devising occasions to celebrate it daley also contributed to john f kennedys narrow  vote victory in illinois in  a pbs documentary entitled daley explained that mayor daley and jfk potentially stole the  election by stuffing ballot boxes and rigging the vote in chicagocitation needed although often quoted as fact this repeated claim is impossible kennedy won with  electoral college votes and needed only  meaning nixon would have lost even had he won illinois  votes had nixon won illinois  electoral votes he would have had  electoral votes while kennedy would have had  daley is also known for saying the cynical phrase vote early  and often he was notorious for corruption and manipulation of the democratic process  in  sclcs james bevel and martin luther king jr took the civil rights movement north and encouraged racial integration of chicagos neighborhoods such as marquette park daley called for a summit conference and signed an agreement with king and other community leaders to foster open housing the public agreement itself was without legal standing and ignored sclcs efforts in chicago contributed to the passage of the fair housing act two years later  and later careeredit jimmy carter and daley at the illinois state democratic convention in chicago illinois  daley at the opening day parade for the lakefront festival  the year  was a momentous year for daley in april daley was castigated by many for his sharp rhetoric in the aftermath of rioting that took place after martin luther king jrs assassination displeased with what he saw as an overcautious police response to the rioting daley chastised police superintendent james b conlisk and subsequently related that conversation at a city hall press conference as follows i said to him very emphatically and very definitely that an order be issued by him immediately to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a molotov cocktail in his hand because theyre potential murderers and to shoot to maim or cripple anyone looting this statement generated significant controversy daleys supporters deluged his office with grateful letters and telegrams nearly  according to time magazinecitation needed but others were appalled reverend jesse jackson for example called it a fascists response the mayor later backed away from his words in an address to the city council saying it is the established policy of the police department – fully supported by this administration – that only the minimum force necessary be used by policemen in carrying out their duties later that month daley asserted there wasnt any shoottokill order that was a fabrication in august the  democratic national convention was held in chicago intended to showcase daleys achievements to national democrats and the news media the proceedings during the convention instead garnered notoriety for the mayor and city descending into verbal outbursts on the part of politicians and a circus for the media with the nation divided by the vietnam war and with the assassinations of king and robert f kennedy earlier that year serving as backdrop the city became a battleground for antivietnam war protesters who vowed to shut down the convention in some cases confrontations between protesters and police turned violent with images of this violence broadcast on national television later antiwar activists abbie hoffman jerry rubin and three other members of the chicago seven were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent of inciting a riot as a result of these confrontations though the convictions were overturned on appeal at the convention itself sen abraham a ribicoff dconn went offscript during his speech nominating george mcgovern saying and with george mcgovern as president of the united states we wouldn’t have to have gestapo tactics in the streets of chicago and with george mcgovern as president we wouldnt have to have a national guard ribicoff with his voice shaking then said how hard it is to speak the truth when we know the problems that are facing this nation for which some in the crowd booed ribicoff ribicoff also tried to introduce a motion to shut down the convention and move it to another city many conventioneers applauded ribicoffs remarks but an indignant mayor daley tried to shout down the speaker as television cameras focused on daley lipreaders throughout america claimed to have observed him shouting fuck you you jew son of a bitch defenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling ribicoff a faker a charge denied by daley and refuted by mike roykos reporting a federal commission led by local attorney party activist dan walker investigated the events surrounding the convention and described them as a police riot daley defended his police force with the following statement which was also a slip of the tongue the confrontation was not caused by the police the confrontation was caused by those who charged the police gentlemen lets get this thing straight once and for all the policeman is not here to create disorder the policeman is here to preserve disorder public opinion polls conducted after the convention demonstrated that the majority of americans supported the mayors tactics daley was historically reelected for the fifth time in  however many have argued this was due to a lack of formidable opposition rather than daleys own popularity in  democratic nominee george mcgovern threw daley out of the democratic national convention replacing his delegation with one led by jesse jackson this event arguably marked a downturn in daleys power and influence within the democratic party but given his public standing mcgovern later made amends by putting daley loyalist and kennedy inlaw sargent shriver on his ticket in january  former illinois racing board chairman william s miller testified that daley had induced him to bribe illinois governor otto kerner death and funeraledit shorty after  pm on december   daley collapsed on the citys nearnorth side while on his way to lunch daley was rushed to the office of his private physician at  north michigan avenue it

needed or daley senior to residents of chicago speaking styleedit wikiquote has quotations related to richard j daley daley who never lost his bluecollar chicago accent was known for often mangling his syntax and other verbal gaffes daley made one of his most memorable verbal missteps in  while defending what the news media reported as police misconduct during that years violent democratic convention stating gentlemen get the thing straight once and for all — the policeman isnt there to create disorder the policeman is there to preserve disorder daleys reputation for misspeaking was such that his press secretary earl bush would tell reporters write what he means not what he says legacyedit a poll of  historians political scientists and urban experts ranked daley as the sixth best mayor in american history daleys ways may not have been democratic but his defenders have argued that he achieved positive things for chicago which a nonboss would have been unable to do while detractors point out that he did nothing to integrate what had then become known as the most segregated city in the nation others argue that he was acting on behalf of his constituency who did not want an integrated chicago on the th anniversary of daleys first  swearingin several dozen daley biographers and associates met at the chicago historical society historian michael beschloss called daley the preeminent mayor of the th century chicago journalist elizabeth taylor said because of mayor daley chicago did not become a detroit or a cleveland many feel that by revitalizing the downtown area and firmly fixing the middleclass in place in the city limits daley probably did save chicago from declining to the extent of the average rust belt city robert remini pointed out that while other cities were in fiscal crisis in the s and s chicago always had a doublea bond rating according to chicago folksinger steve goodman no man could inspire more love more hate daleys twentyoneyear tenure

police the confrontation was caused by those who charged the police gentlemen lets get this thing straight once and for all the policeman is not here to create disorder the policeman is here to preserve disorder public opinion polls conducted after the convention demonstrated that the majority of americans supported the mayors tactics daley was historically reelected for the fifth time in

surrounding the convention and described them as a police riot daley defended his police force with the following statement which was also a slip of the tongue the confrontation was not caused by the police the confrontation was caused by those who charged the police gentlemen lets get this thing straight once and for all the policeman is not here to create disorder the policeman is here to preserve disorder public opinion polls conducted after the convention demonstrated that the majority of americans supported the mayors tactics daley was historically reelected for the fifth time in  however many have argued this was due to a lack of formidable opposition rather than daleys own popularity in  democratic nominee george mcgovern threw daley out of the democratic national convention replacing his delegation with one led by jesse jackson this event arguably marked a downturn in daleys power and influence within the democratic party but given his public standing mcgovern later made amends by putting daley loyalist and kennedy inlaw sargent shriver on his ticket in january  former illinois racing board chairman william s miller testified that daley had induced him to bribe illinois governor otto kerner death and funeraledit shorty after  pm on december   daley collapsed on the citys nearnorth side while on his way to lunch daley was rushed to the office of his private

needed old man daley papa bearcitation needed or daley senior to residents of chicago speaking styleedit wikiquote has quotations related to richard j daley daley who never lost his bluecollar chicago accent was known for often mangling his syntax and other verbal gaffes daley made one of his most memorable verbal missteps in  while defending what the news media reported as police misconduct during that years violent democratic convention stating gentlemen get the thing straight once and for all — the policeman isnt there to create disorder the policeman is there to preserve disorder daleys reputation for misspeaking was such that his press secretary earl bush would tell reporters write what he means not what he says legacyedit a poll of  historians political scientists and urban experts ranked daley as the sixth best mayor in american history daleys ways may not have been democratic but his defenders have argued that he achieved positive things for chicago which a nonboss would have been unable to do while detractors point out that he did nothing to integrate what had then become known as the most segregated city in the nation others argue that he was acting on behalf of his constituency who did not want an integrated chicago on the th anniversary of daleys first  swearingin several dozen daley biographers and associates met at the chicago historical society historian michael beschloss called daley the preeminent mayor of the th century chicago journalist elizabeth taylor said because of mayor daley chicago did not become a detroit or a cleveland many feel that by revitalizing the downtown area and firmly fixing the middleclass in place in the city limits daley probably did save chicago from declining to the extent of the average rust belt city robert remini pointed out that while other cities were in fiscal crisis in the s and s chicago always had a doublea bond rating according to chicago folksinger steve goodman no man could inspire more love more hate

topicssite guidefeedbackjob opportunitiesdecember  obituarymayor richard daley of chicago dies at by paul delaney special to the new york timeschicago dec mayor richard j daley head of this citys democratic machine and one of the most powerful democrats in the country for more than two decades died today of a heart attack the yearold mayor last of the bigcity bosses was stricken after  pm and collapsed on his way to lunch on the near north side he was taken to the office of his private physician at  north michigan avenue where he was treated as emergency equipment and vehicles stood by he was pronounced dead at  oclock earlier in the day mayor daley attended the annual christmas breakfast for department heads where they surprised him with roundtrip tickets to ireland for him and mrs daley at noon during dedication ceremonies for a new gymnasium on the far south side he was asked to shoot the first basketball he sank the shot on his first try the portly redcheeked irishamerican was elected in  to his sixth fouryear term the previous year he had suffered a stroke that kept him from his civic duties for four months leading to speculation even among close associates and friends that he would not be able to run again he not only won but scored overwhelming victories in the primary and general elections as usual the mayor will be immediately succeeded by alderman wilson frost president pro tem of the city council mr frost who is black will serve until the council convenes a special meeting to elect an acting mayor from among the aldermen then a special election will be set within three months for the remaining twoandonehalf years of mayor daleys term however confusion set in immediately over the procedure for succession mr frost arriving at city hall was asked whether he was now the acting mayor in accordance with the law yes i am remarked the topranking black associate of mayor daley but deputy mayor kenneth sain said it was his understanding that there would be no acting mayor until the council holds its election the death leaves the citys democratic machine in disarray there never was a successor because the mayor never allowed a line of succession to develop therefore political observers expect a pitched battle among the democrats not only for mayor but for party chairman a post mr daley also held the battle is seen developing among the following factions some of his old contemporaries and possibly one of his sons will make a try at taking over they include his son senator richard m daley secretary of state michael j howlett the mayors handpicked candidate in a losing effort in the gubernatorial race last month lieut gov neil f hartigan another of the mayors losers last month and alderman michael a bilandic younger machine politicians frustrated over the tightfisted control of the party machinery by the mayor are a factor among them are alderman edward r vrdolyak and edward m burke the independents who bitterly opposed mayor daley are not expected to be much more of a threat with his death blacks represent the biggest single block of voters in the city and are crucial to the success of the machine but they are severely divided with some tied tightly to the machine in command since  the mayor had dominated politics in this city since his first term in  after working his way up from precinct politics he also became a force in national democratic politics as illinois was one of those key big industrial states that have been crucial to democratic presidential aspirants but recent times showed a definite decline in his power he lost several posts that helped him maintain that power including the governors seat and the office of states attorney the decline could also be seen in the state legislature where his forces have suffered several major setbacks including attempts to seek additional funds for chicagos schools as in life a veil of secrecy surrounded the events of the mayors last minutes for two hours the nature of his illness was left to unconfirmed reports of his choking on food while eating with friends to collapsing on the sidewalk the police closed off the section around the office building as throngs of holiday shoppers on the avenue talked about the unknown illness doctors from northwestern universitys hospital four blocks away were called in and emergency equipment including an ambulance stood by as reports circulated that the ill mayor would be taken to the hospital and at northwestern there were reports that medical personnel were standing by awaiting his arrival then the announcement this went on for nearly two hours and even when the ambulance wheeled away its rear window covered many persons thought it was taking him to the hospital it was finally announced at about  pm by mr kenneth sain that mayor daley had died later the mayors physician dr thomas j coogan jr said mr daley had come to his office complaining about chest pains the doctor said he took a cardiogram and left the examining room to alert the hospital that the mayor would be coming over when he returned to the room dr coogan said he found that mr daley had been stricken the doctor worked on the mayor assisted by his associate they were joined by fire department paramedics and doctors from northwestern university they worked on him until  dr coogan said while he was out of the room the mayor spoke to his son richard m daley on the telephone the mayors wife eleanor and their three daughters and four sons and their wives were with him at the time of death dr coogan said the mayor died of ventricular fibrillation a disordered heartbeat that he termed one of the lethal rhythms of the heart unchallenged leader by seth s king in any case study of americas great political machines it is commonly accepted that the cook county democratic organization is the largest richest and the last in the nation still at full thrust for more than  years the unchallenged driver of this awesomely powerful vehicle was richard j daley from the day in  when he seized its controls until he died mr daley drove the cook county machine and the machine directed virtually every municipal function performed for the people of chicago and many of those offered residents of the suburbs in cook county that surround chicago on three sides knew ward functions he understood every bolt and gear in the machine and how to utilize its power no detail of its functions was too small for him to bother with even after  years at its head he understood the block by block development of the machine beginning with the precinct captains who held card files on every resident in their precinct and who called on every one of them before election day to make certain that each understood whom the organization was supporting he knew the workings of the ward committeemen who directed the precinct captains and stood ready to see that the garbage of the faithful voters was picked up and the potholes in their streets were filled and he understood the use of the more than  city and county jobs noncivil service available to those machines workers who delivered the vote in their precincts the wealthy captains of chicagos industry and real estate most of whom are republicans and live in the suburbs knew little of richard daley  years ago but they soon learned that he was as eager for their prosperity and expansion as they were and they soon put aside philosophical differences they may have had with him and became reliable sources of funds and approval in return they could count on the machine for the best of tax breaks and the least of zoning problems for almost all of those  years mr daley was also the dominating force among illinois democrats and with his tight grip on the states large convention delegation he had been one of the most potent figures in the selection of the democratic partys presidential candidates daley means the whole ball game the late senator robert f kennedy once said when assessing the deciding factors in democratic conventions the mayor did indeed play a major role in gaining the democratic presidential nominations in  and again in  for adlai e stevenson whose election as governor of illinois had depended heavily on mr daleys efforts the mayor who already had an abiding friendship with joseph p kennedy a fellow irishamerican whom he understood and appreciated was certainly the decisive force in nominating john f kennedy in  and electing him president that fall the mayor delivered a vote plurality in cook county for mr kennedy and many political scholars still insist that the cook county machines ability to produce badly needed votes from the graveyards was what won illinois for mr kennedy who carried the state by a feeble  votes and thus defeated richard m nixon in the nation rowdy convention mr daley savored his convention roles and he was delighted in  when chicago was once again selected as the site of the democratic national convention but this pleasure turned sour when the already divided and disorganized democrats belabored each other in the partys worst brawl and the chicago police bloodied the strident young antiwar activists outside the amphitheater in teargas turmoil few who followed these antics will ever forget the televised sequence showing mr daley drawing a finger across his jowls in a signal to the podium to cut the microphones as senator abraham a ribicoff spoke of things the mayor did not want heard hubert h humphrey mr daleys candidate won the  nomination but the democratic party was left in shambles and mr daley was looked upon by many in the national party as an anachronistic ogre while the democrats in chicago as well as many of his nonpolitical constituents still regarded their mayor with admiration his standing in the national party suffered still further senator george mcgovern and the young liberals in the party who supported him were alien to mr daley and so were the organizational reforms mr mcgovern pushed onto the national party the mayor ignored these reforms and in  suffered the ignominy of rejection when alderman william singer a brash young independent democrat joined with rev jesse l jackson the black leader of operation push to unseat the daleycontrolled convention delegation the mayor went to the convention in miami but its doors were closed to him back in the fold the aging mayor was welcomed back to the national democratic fold in the wake of mr mcgoverns defeat he was once again courted by the nations party regulars at the democrats miniconvention in kansas city in  but last novembers election showed clearly that his influence in statewide politics was eroding he turned out  percent of the citys vote for mr carter but he could not pull in enough downstate support to win illinois for the former georgia governor no one was a more thorough product of his environment than richard j daley he was born on may   in a modest brick house in the bridgeport neighborhood of chicago the son of an irishamerican sheetmetal worker and union activist he grew up on that same block and when he died he was still living in another modest brick bungalow at  south lowe avenue a few doors down from his birthplace bridgeport was a tough bluecollar area of irishcatholics part of the rack of the yards district west of chicagos odorous stockyards and packing houses mr daley attended the neighborhood parochial schools and de la salle institute a catholic secondary school short and powerfully built he played hard fought hard in the neighborhood gangs and from an early age worked hard delivering papers and later pushing cattle through the stockyard pens but the stockyards were no place that young daley wanted to spend his life and he quickly recognized that in chicago an irish catholic boy could find happiness and a good living in politics mr daley became a precinct captain when he was  and shortly thereafter putting the stenographic training he had received at de la salle to good use he became a clerk in the city council his friends and even his detractors agree that he worked hard stayed sober and never appeared to lose his vision of power at the top of the political heap he held city jobs while he became a ward committeeman and then a legislator spending nearly  years in the state assembly and state senate there he was known as the man who would always attend meetings as he was supposed to always behaved himself by abstaining from the fleshpots of springfield and who became a recognized expert on finance and taxation he had also put himself through depaul university and its law school and he had married a neighborhood irishamerican girl named eleanor guilfoyle whom he and everyone else who knew her called sis as he became a member of the cook county democratic central committee and his political weight increased he threw it behind some atypical figures mr daley was an active force in adlai stevensons successful campaign for governor in  the election to the senate that same year of a chicago university economist named paul douglas and in the surprising victory of harry s truman in illinois kept on winning a grateful governor stevenson named mr daley director of state revenue but in  he rose to a far more important pinnacle cook county democratic chairman the top of the political heap and a position that he would jealously guard until his death two years later in  when the machine had tired of the amateurish reforms of mayor martin j kennelly a democrat mr daley led the move to dump mr kennelly he got himself drafted for mayor and after a rough primary smothered mr kennelly he then went on to win a freeswinging chicagostyle general election replete with the familiar charges of vote fraud against republican alderman robert merriam every four years after that mr daley ran again and won each time by an increasingly larger margin as the machine prospered and the republican opposition became more enfeebled in the  years that he headed chicagos municipal government mr daley became synonymous with the citys image burly rough powerful restless and except for its burgeoning black residents a study in middleclass prosperity he quickly became known as a brick and mortar man and for most of his tenure chicago grew upward in a continuous building boom not all of this time was smooth the mayor suffered the embarrassments of periodic police scandals in his later terms chicagos whites began fleeing to the suburbs at a rate of  a year as the citys black population grew larger the machines control over it slipped mr daley weathered the painful period of the openhousing marches of the late rev dr martin luther king jr in  but he was emotionally shaken and furious at the rioting and destruction in the citys two black ghettoes in the wake of dr kings assassination in april  it was then that he issued his shoot to kill order on arsonists and placed himself beyond the touch of the blacks in his final term the machine still had the citys throttle in its grip it still tolerated nothing more than verbal opposition from without and maintained the strictest obedience from within the mayor had the unwavering support of virtually all the  aldermen on the city council nonetheless there were misfires that injured his pride and peace of mind in the primary of  dan walker a highly successful corporation lawyer upset all the form sheets by beating paul simon the choice of the mayor and the regular democratic organization in the race for governor that fall mr walker who made many caustic remarks about machine politicians before he made a preelection peace with mr daley edged the incumbent republican richard ogilvie and became governor he also became a rival in democratic politics to mr daley even more damaging was the machines defeat in the fall of  in the election for states attorney the county chief prosecutor equally as bad with the election of richard m nixon in  the united states attorney for the chicago district was now a republican the machine did not rest easily in the mayors last years several of the machines top gears some of them mr daleys oldest and closest political associates were indicted on federal and county charges of conspiracy and bribery and some were convicted while none of this implicated mr daley directly he did suffer the embarrassment of the disclosure of his youngest son john representing a local insurance firm that suddenly got more than  million in city insurance premiums after young mr daley had come to work for the firm as a beginning agent even so mr daley seemed both politically and physically indestructible as he began his d year and his th year in office when he suddenly entered the hospital in early may  it was learned he had suffered a mild stroke and that while he had appeared as robust and vigorous as ever he had also been suffering from a mild form of diabetes and high blood
