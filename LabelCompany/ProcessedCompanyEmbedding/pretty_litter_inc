inches of depth covers the entire surface of the litter box prettylitter absorbs urine and traps odor the water in the urine evaporates hygienically sealing the urine in the tiny microgels remove your cats feces every day with the feces sitting in the scooper shake the remaining litter in the scooper back over the litter box to retain the litter granules throw the feces away only toss the feces  the urine moisture evaporates thoroughly mix the litter every day to avoid saturating the same spots in the litter box that cats prefer to urinate in thoroughly mixing the litter will make it easier for you to spot color change and keep prettylitters health indicators operating at full capacity prettylitter granules will continue to be effective throughout the month evaporating moisture allowing more urine to be absorbed and odors continuously trapped prettylitter health indicators will work just as well on day  as it does on day  after a months use empty the entire litter box content in to a trash bag if there is any residue on the bottom of the litter box clean the litter surface before pouring in your new supply of prettylitter regularly check the color of the litter shades of dark yellow and olive green are an indication of normal health if you notice any other colors thoroughly mix the litter and monitor your cats prettylitter closely over the next  to  hours if color change persists you should consider consulting your veterinarian ◄how does  pounds of litter last an entire month prettylitter uses highly absorbent silica microcrystals silica is a naturally occurring element that traps odors absorbs liquid and evaporates humidity with tens of thousands of highly absorbent microcrystals in each prettylitter bag your cat can continue to urinate in the litter all month long without needing to toss it out the urines odor is trapped and the moisture evaporates all you need to do is toss the feces out as a result prettylitter doesnt need to clump because you do not need to throw out the urine its moisture evaporates in the microcrystals compare that to clumping clay litter clumping clay litter known as bentonite clay forms clumps through a chemical bonding process when liquid is introduced as you toss the clumps out you are also tossing the litter attached to it as a result you need to keep replenishing the litter box with more litter throughout the month on average it takes close to  pounds of clay clumping litter to provide a one month supply in one litter box in addition to the extra weight clay clumping litter is dusty and awful at scent control that dust can be harmful to you cats respiratory system also clumping clay clogs our landfills prettylitters silica microcrystals are lowdust in the litter box and is safe for your cat ◄what

eliminate odor and evaporate moisture during a healthy product lifecycle when prettylitter is at the end of its life cycle because the month is expiring or there isnt enough litter in the litter box

much of pretty litter should i use to last a month prettylitter’s lb bags last an entire month for a medium sized cat just pour the entire bag in to your freshly cleaned litter box it is recommended to use at least  inches depth lining the litter tray fortunately an insufficient amount of litter depth will not influence prettylitter’s functionality either way it’s best for your cat to have at least  inches of depth which one bag of prettylitter will provide for a medium sized cat in a litter box fitting their size ◄will prettylitter work in my self cleaning automated litter box prettylitter works in most automated selfcleaning boxes prettylitters microgels have the texture of sand and is similar in texture to fine crystal litters as long as your automated box can work with other crystal litters prettylitter will work great in an automated selfcleaning litter box ◄what if my cat is bigger than a medium sized cat if your cat is larger and you have a larger litter box as a result then buy an extra bag of prettylitter and use just half of that bag along with the first bag if you have a cat that loves to dig that extra bag will get you to at least  inches of litter lining the surface of the tray ◄what do i do with the waste prettylitter traps the urine and odor while releasing the moisture the only waste you need to dispose of is solid excrement when in contact with prettylitter the humidity in excrement is immediately absorbed which traps odors and dries up the feces making it easier to remove with a litter scoop just throw it away like you normally would ◄how is it that prettylitter is so much lighter than most other kitty litters prettylitter’s patented technology traps odors and urine and has an absorption rate of  what that means is prettylitter can be used over and over throughout a month to trap odors and liquid that is why prettylitter avoids the need to be a clumping litter clumping litter turns urine into larger hard clumps that need to be consistently thrown out this requires more litter making bags heavier and your need to replace litter more frequently prettylitter only requires you to dispose of fecal waste so our nonclumping formula lasts an entire month at just lbs a bag compare that to two trips to the market each month accumulating lbs of litter pretty litter saves you hassle and money ◄how do i make sure i am using prettylitter correctly prettylitter is designed for very easy use but to ensure that you have a full onemonth supply without odors you need to remove feces frequently using your scooper to remove any excess litter allowing it to fall back into the litter box once you’ve removed the waste just thoroughly mix the litter with your scooper cats have a tendency of urinating in the same area of the litter box therefore it is necessary to mix the litter so that it is not always the same granules that receive urine the yellow color of the crystals may cause you to think that they are no longer efficient but it’s not true prettylitter crystals stay yellow because the pigments ammonia and the odors are trapped but the humidity evaporates and the granule is functional again just use the litter like you normally would for a month by disposing of cat feces frequently and mixing the litter ◄if the color change tracks outside the litter box will color get on the floor prettylitter silica gels absorb and traps urine and changes color internally if any litter makes its way outside the litter box the color is trapped inside the granules there is no issue with color getting on anything ◄where
