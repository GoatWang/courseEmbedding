product portfolio  aixtron deutsch  한국말   quality guaranteematerial categoriesproduct portfoliotechnologiesapplications our market expertise is your recipe for successto date aixtron has delivered more than  deposition systems to customers around the world we have also enhanced existing technologies and take pride that our comprehensive expertise and many years of experience in the deposition of complex semiconductor materials have served as a foundation for many of customers’ success production systems compound semiconductors mocvd applying this production methodology the source materials which are metalorganic compounds are transported by way of a carrier gas and gradually supplied to the reactor a complex chemical reaction results in thin semiconductor layers the introduced gases are of a very high purity and can be exceptionally well dosed which enables the film growth to be precisely controlled planetary reactor the planetary reactor is based on the principle of a horizontal laminar flow reactor the laminar flow principle ensures extremely precise transitions between different materials and an unparalleled control over the deposition rates for films that are only a few atoms thick aix g for gan on  mm siaix g c for gan on  mm siaix g httm aix gtm close coupled showerhead applying this technology the process gases are introduced vertically over the entire coating surface in the reactor via the watercooled showerhead surface the gas flow into the reactor is designed in such a manner that the group iii and group v gases are separated until they enter the reactor by many small narrow tubes at the showerhead inlet this technology ensures an unmatched level of reproducibility aix r sic planetary reactor for semiconductor properties silicon carbide stands out especially when it comes to power rectifiers as well as switches for converting and distributing electricity the planetary reactor enables several  or inch or  mm sic wafers to be coated at the same
