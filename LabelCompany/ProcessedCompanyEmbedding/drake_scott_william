this conference call contains timesensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast february   ill now turn the call over to scott drake scott scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director thanks lynn and good afternoon everyone ill begin by sharing performance for each business unit and highlight traction in our commercial execution and innovation pipeline in the fourth quarter we posted topline growth of  on a constantcurrency basis q built on a solid q and we feel it represents another positive step forward we entered  positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us on our call well discuss q performance highlights provide an update on strategic initiatives stacy will review our financials and outlook for  and we look forward to answering your questions ill start with performance highlights from q all numbers will be on a constantcurrency basis our vascular business grew  over prior year growth drivers were longstanding strength in us peripheral atherectomy where we continue to significantly outpace market growth performance was again balanced across hospitals and officebased labs coronary atherectomy and stellarex also contributed nicely to our growth in terms of growth limiters angiosculpt results were flat both yearoveryear and sequentially laser service and other revenue declined  as we transitioned from selling lasers to more of a placement model in lead management growth was flat as increasing mechanical device volume was offset by launch stocking orders in the comparable period netting out the stocking effect lm grew midsingle digits we continue to be pleased with our mechanical conversions globally and our customers and we are excited about the launch of our bridge device which ill highlight in a moment our international business was up  and disposable growth was up about twice that rate this performance was primarily driven by increases in stellarex angiosculpt and mechanical tools in europe and our coronary business in japan growth was largely offset by a decrease in laser sales and service due to the placement strategy previously mentioned in summary our focus as an organization is to drive revenue growth by delivering innovative products a drumbeat of compelling clinical data and strong commercial execution shifting attention to our strategic initiatives were focused on our drugcoated balloon platform the instent restenosis indication and continued efforts to unlock the lead management market opportunity first ill highlight our dcb portfolio the european stellarex launch is ongoing and our team is making progress on market access initiatives the conversion pipeline is building and customer feedback continues to be very positive at the linc conference last month stellarex was center stage on podium talks and highlighted as a toptier device professor brodmann stated that while three drugcoated balloons have rigorously studied only two warrant adoption due to clinical efficacy to be abundantly clear stellarex is one of the two key opinion leaders are aligned that coatings matter and that there is no class effect the combination of toptier performance at relatively low drug dosage is why kols view stellarex as a nextgeneration device our messaging around more with less is resonating with customers and we anticipate that clinical data presentations over the course of  will validate our impressive first inhuman results at the jpmorgan conference we shared our projected timeline of clinical data releases the first such opportunity is in april at charing cross where professor thomas zeller will present a month subset of fullyadjudicated data from our global registry this will be followed by presentations of our month european randomized study and the us pivotal trial later in the year at viva and tct respectively  sets up to be an exciting year for stellarex we continue to anticipate european launch of the stellarex belowtheknee platform by the end of this year and on the coronary side our drugcoated angiosculpt program also remains on track for commercial launch we are well positioned to have a compelling highlydifferentiated dcb portfolio in europe by the end of this year finally in the us were on track with the pma submission for our abovetheknee platform turning our attention to the instent restenosis opportunity weve made some important progress in late  fda clearance of our turbopower catheter which carries the indication is an important innovation in our effort to improve patient outcomes isr continues to be a key driver for our peripheral atherectomy business and this new device should augment our ability to further penetrate the market we are the only peripheral atherectomy company with an isr indication and it is supported by randomized controlled data our primary competitors remain contraindicated in lead management we anticipate  to be a meaningful step forward for improved patient outcomes in our effort to help eliminate mortality we are excited to bring our bridge to surgery device to market dr jude clancy a global thought leader from yale is calling bridge the biggest advancement in lead extraction since the introduction of the laser the product embodiment is a onesizefitsall occlusive balloon which is intended to be easily and quickly deployed in the rare event of an svc tear rapid deployment mitigates blood loss and allows potentially lifesaving time for surgical repair we will begin a limited market release and intend full launch midyear in addition to the bridge device we continue to focus on targeted market development efforts and mechanical device conversions both of which are progressing nicely before i turn the call over to stacy id like to comment on our competitive position and the strength of our pipeline moving forward on the lm side we are the market leader and our pipeline of products and market development efforts are intended to better serve a profoundly undertreated patient population we will continue to expand our product offering and work to solve the issues that gate broadbased adoption of hrs guidelines number one on the pareto according to our research is perceived fear of the procedure our bridge device represents a significant advance in changing perception and we will methodically march forward on this opportunity we are very wellpositioned in the lead management market on the vi side we have thoughtfully built a portfolio in anticipation of and in line with market trends of note we learned through kol engagement that vessel preparation is essential to successfully treat complex disease we have also been clear that our customers desire durable stentlike results without leaving an implant behind that definitive treatment in the peripheral market would take the form of drugcoated balloons for the foreseeable future in short our portfolio is wellpositioned for where the market is going from crossing solutions to vessel preparation to complex coronary to drugcoated balloons we have a highlydifferentiated and effective set of clinical solutions complementing our product portfolio are unique indications and compelling data this position will strengthen in the quarters and years ahead in closing ill provide context on the k we filed today regarding the departure of kim bridges two years ago i asked our vp of vascular sales to move over to the lm side of our business to improve execution and further develop bench strength he and the team did a great job with this and we moved him back to the vascular business several months ago this move has been very wellreceived by our team he and our vp of vascular marketing now report directly to me i will now turn the call over to stacy to review our financials and  outlook stacy powell mcmahan  chief financial officer thank you scott and good afternoon i will begin by referring you to the press release issued this afternoon for details we will file our form k with the securities and exchange commission before the end of the month consolidated fourth quarter revenue was  million delivering a growth of  as reported  constant currency and  sequentially for the full year  revenue was  million growing at  as reported or  on a constantcurrency basis total revenue excluding angiosculpt grew  as reported or  constant currency our june   acquisition of angioscore is now fully reflected in all reference periods and will be reported quarterly and annually as part of our vascular intervention product line revenue going forward we report our revenue by major product line and by geographic segments our three reported product lines are vascular intervention comprised of coronary and peripheral products spanning the cross prep and treat spectrum lead management made up of both laser and mechanical devices and finally other revenue primarily from laser sales rentals and associated service our two geographic reporting segments are the united states and international viewing revenue growth by product line in the quarter vascular intervention revenue was up  or  in constant currency and up  on the sequential quarter with a seasonally strong fourth quarter within the year lead management revenue was down  to prior year flat on a constantcurrency basis but up  on a sequential quarter basis laser service and other revenue decreased  or  in constant currency looking at our geographic reporting segments us revenue in the quarter grew  as scott mentioned us peripheral and coronary atherectomy grew in the doubledigit range primary offsets to this performance were declines in the us angiosculpt peripheral business flat lead management revenues and declines in laserrelated revenue international revenue in the quarter was flat as reported but grew  on a constantcurrency basis led by our stellarex drugcoated balloon as well as strong performance in coronary products lead management mechanical tools and angiosculpt this growth was offset by a continuing and expected decline in laser revenue gross margin at  was slightly favorable to the fourth quarter of  when excluding the acquired inventory stepup this improvement is primarily driven by positive mix and production efficiencies as well as an approximate  basis point nonrecurring favorable impact associated with the recent shelf life extension for stellarex this was partially offset by unfavorable impact of currency and laser depreciation selling general and administrative expenses were up  in the quarter and represented  of sales due to higher spending on the stellarex launch in europe and us sales force additions that were partially offset by lower performancedriven variable compensation expense rd spending was up  and represented  of sales led by our significant investment in stellarex and our continued investment in our innovation pipeline and supporting clinical work turning our attention to certain special items on our pl you will note decreased cost related to our angioscore and stellarex acquisitions and integrations this decrease was led by reduced activity associated with the angioscorerelated litigation the remainder is driven by an overall reduction in the amount of integrationrelated expenses as we have substantially completed integration activities you will also note a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration liability incurred at the time of the angioscore acquisition this is the result of a determination that the associated revenue growth requirements for a milestone payment were unlikely to be achieved in the defined timeframe this fair value reduction to a contingent liability was favorable to our income by  million walking down the pl operating losses of  million in the quarter compared to  million loss in the same quarter a year ago net losses for the quarter were  million versus a  million net loss in the prior year excluding special items nongaap net losses were  million and  million for the fourth quarters of  and  respectively cash on hand at the end of the year was  million down from  million at the beginning of the year for fiscalyear  proceeds from our debt financing in december funded cash used in operating activities of  million and cash used in acquiring the stellarex assets of  million for the quarter cash used in operating activities was  million representing a cash used increase of  million over the prior quarter this was primarily driven by a reduction in current liabilities regarding liquidity as we briefly discussed on our prior earnings call we completed a refinancing of our outstanding debt and closed on a new  million senior secured credit facility in december the credit facility consists of a  million term loan and a  million revolving line of credit both the term loan and revolver are floatingrate debt and have covenant around minimum revenue growth and cash on hand we believe that this new credit facility provides ample liquidity through the us launch of stellarex and beyond before shifting attention to our  outlook i would like to briefly comment on our laser installed base we have now seen new laser placements in the s and s for the last five quarters however our net placement rate is significantly lower as we approach the launch of our nextgeneration laser we are highly focused on the optimization of our existing fleet these optimization activities take the form of reallocating our existing lasers in the field to drive greater productivity from each now moving on to our  financial outlook we are projecting revenue in the range of  million to  million an increase of  to  over  we are not projecting a net impact of currency in this guidance vascular intervention revenue growth is anticipated to be midsingle to lowdouble digits lead management growth is anticipated to be low to midsingle digit offsetting this growth is an expected decline in our laser service and other revenue of approximately  this range can generally be characterized by a continuation of our q  performance the low end includes the potential for intensified competition in vascular intervention and lm softness the high end contemplates an upside in growth for our key product categories net loss for  is expected to be within a range of  million to  million or  to  per share nongaap net loss is expected to be within a range of  million to  million or  to  per share please see the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained in our press release gross margin is expected to range from  to  the primary drivers for gross margin are increased disposable sales as well as increased operational efficiencies the primary limiter to gross margin expansion is ramping production volume associated with stellarex as is expected with an earlystage launch we expect more significant leverage in gross margin as we move into the us launch of stellarex in  research and development expenses are expected to continue to be in the range of  to  of revenue driven by the significant investment in the stellarex program while we have fully enrolled all illumenate studies there remains significant cost as we complete month and month followup on the over  enrolled patients selling general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of  to  of revenue this is driven by the fullyear impact of investments made in our commercial footprint over the course of  in addition as compared to  we expect achievement of performancedriven variable compensation which accounted for lowerthanexpected costs in  base interest expense on debt is expected to be in the range of  million to  million and could vary depending upon our revolver balances thank you for your continued interest in spectranetics i will now turn the call back to scott for closing remarks scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director thanks stacy in summary q was another step forward we remained focused on our innovation pipeline clinical data and commercial execution we are increasingly wellpositioned to capitalize on the large and diverse set of opportunities our team has created joining us for qa is shar matin our chief operating officer operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel your line is now open rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc good afternoon everybody scott stacy maybe just talk about the guidance first i mean thank you stacy for commenting on what drives the upper or lower end but maybe scott you could talk a little bit about the greater competition possibility on the low end are you seeing incremental competition or some pickup that makes that more of a concern in  in some specific area us or ous that we should be sensitive to scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director thanks for the question rick i think the dynamic that were experiencing in the market in q was pretty similar to q overall procedure growth continues in the mid singledigit rate peripheral atherectomy as you know was a bit higher and were about  times overall market growth rate in the vascular business drugcoated balloons continue to be rapidly adopted thats good for patients and us over time it represents continued pressure you saw the flatness continue in our angiosculpt business but overall the net effect on atherectomy feels similar in that there are puts and takes but no net effect thats obvious to us so i think its kind of more of the same rick and as stacy outlined in her commentary on guidance continuation of q generally speaking is what were calling for at the midpoint of our range rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay as my followup ill turn to stellarex its certainly going to be in a critical year with all the data maybe scott if you could talk about in europe or shar can you give us some visibility on the early days of commercialization who the adopters are is it existing laser accounts are they new accounts are you crossselling pulling through your broader vi portfolio just help ground us in sort of whats happening with stellarex in europe in these early days scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah happy to rick and ill welcome shar in in a moment if he wants to add any color the first thing that i would highlight there is that it was the top driver of growth for us in europe in q it really is growing in concert with current customers but we are converting new customers as well i think the team is making very nice progress on our market access initiatives including tenders and gpos and the conversion pipeline is building specifically as it regards to those that im most gratified that we have converted or are in the process of converting i would say as key opinion leaders especially those that have been involved in virtually all of the meaningful drugcoated balloon studies that are out there so i think there is an overall positive impact rick but i think its also opening up new customers to us shar would you add any color to that shahriar matin  chief operating officer sure i would just add that in addition to as we look at the full portfolio and we saw some positive growth in our angiosculpt business the opportunity to do vessel prep plus drug delivery and sell that full bag has been resonating with our customers out in europe so thats been a big positive pull through for us as well scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director great point thanks shar operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jason mills from canaccord genuity your line is now open jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc hi scott thanks for taking the question can you hear me okay scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director sure can jason thank you jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc so ill start where rick left off on stellarex im hoping you could calibrate us a little bit and i can appreciate that early days and given that youre trying to stay at a high level if i just ask the question outright what was revenue in the fourth quarter for stellarex what do you expect for this year you may not give it so if youre willing to thats where im going if you arent perhaps calibrate us with respect to what the european market is right now for drugeluting balloons and what sort of exiting the year what kind of run rate or share position maybe range youd aspire to or is factored into your guidance so that we can – it just strikes me that that will be perhaps one of the biggest pivots as to whether youre at the low end or the high end of the range or below or above the ranges thank you scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah absolutely jason thank you for the question i would tell you that the launch is ongoing were not going to provide a specific number either for q or any specificity around what we expect for the individual category either stellarex or others in the year were going to stick with the higherlevel commentary that weve outlined over the past couple of quarters i would tell you that i believe we have a toptier device as i think ive mentioned in prepared remarks and as we saw from the podium at linc the dynamics jason i think youre aware are very different in the european market than what we anticipate in the us market in terms of the number of competitors theres roughly a dozen in europe today there are few companies only three that have real data and the share position really is falling along clinical lines we anticipate a different environment in the us where well be the third entrant so were not going to get specific in terms of the individual numbers but we feel as though were in a very good position to compete jason r mills  canaccord genuity inc okay fair enough i gave it a shot so one quick followup on stellarex and then one on the new products with respect to timelines would your assumptions have it that given when you will plan to file with the fda this year with stellarex that you would still expect a  approval in time to actually contribute to us revenue next year and then with respect to new products weve gotten really good feedback about turbopower specifically that its a device that can be used above the knee – and not just instent restenosis but above the knee much easier whereas the ramp involved in turbotandem would get caught at some point and was not as easy to use so perhaps you could comment on your atherectomy business in the periphery and whether or not turbopower has actually helped you not only in instent restenosis but in sort of de novo abovetheknee disease relative to your previous positioning as well as maybe any comment on the nexcimer the nextgeneration laser weve talked to docs that have seen it and it seems to be perhaps a gamechanger in terms of how much space its taking up in the cath lab thanks scott ill get back in queue scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director absolutely and jason thank you for your thoughtful questions let me take a cut at them hopefully i have them all down here your first question was around stellarex impacting  growth we anticipate that that indeed will be the case obviously at this point not ready to call for that i would anticipate launch of the product – approval of the product in the second half of  but i do think it will be in time to have an impact on our revenue growth in  no further specifics at this time around that as it relates to turbopower you highlight ease of use that is absolutely what were hearing back from our customer base jason that it is easier to use and the ability to use it above the knee both in de novo and isr procedures has proven to be very effective in the early days of our launch here and i think youll see that it will be helpful to us as we go forward in the peripheral atherectomy market weve contemplated the launch of the device in our guidance but we do believe it will help us penetrate the market further and finally on the nexcimer front were looking forward to that product youre right a number of our customers have seen it and not only is it smaller and much more easy to move in the lab the footprint is smaller it takes a  plug versus a  it has virtually instanton the startup time is very minimal relative to the current configuration and we believe it will be a help for us in terms of market penetration going forward so were looking forward to that but that will not be taking place in the  timeframe operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brooks west from piper jaffray your line is now open brooks e west  piper jaffray  co broker hi thanks can you hear me scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director sure can brooks brooks e west  piper jaffray  co broker hey scott i wonder if you could comment more generally on the us peripheral vascular market and im trying to think about whats going on above the knee versus below the knee the various devices and do you still feel like really your trough around your business is isr above the knee and then im curious below the knee do you feel like you were able to take some share based on competitor disruption and could we see that continue and ive got a followup scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah happy to comment there brooks we see the overall market continuing to grow at virtually the same rate that weve been talking about for a long time procedural growth overall is about  peripheral atherectomy is a little bit higher at about  and as you know over the last five years weve been growing two times to three times the market rate generally from quarter to quarter with some quarters being a bit higher and some a tad bit lower than that and that performance continues here as it relates to the belowtheknee market theres primarily two competitors that really have share us and one other company we have been growing nicely in that segment of the market and similarly our position to your point has improved since we achieved the isr indication about a yearandahalf ago now and i think turbopower will also augment our ability to compete there not only within isr but in de novo procedures as well not only the easeofuse characteristics that were mentioned previously but we treat from the tip with turbopower which is meaningful from a safety profile perspective and a decreased risk of distal embolization so were doing quite well really across the landscape the full geography of the leg and also hospitals and officebased labs brooks e west  piper jaffray  co broker okay thats helpful thanks and then maybe transitioning to a little bit longerterm thought you all have talked about transitioning to cash flow positives post the stellarex spend kind of all in and i know that spend has evolved over time but is it still the case should we be looking at  as really more of an inflection to cash generation and how should we think about the associated stellarex spend kind of winding down over the next two years to three years thanks stacy powell mcmahan  chief financial officer brooks its stacy thanks for the question the cash flow as you noted is the investment that we have going is really related to the number of trials that we have and right now we have about  patients active as we move into the  months and  months followup cycle and then we also have – anticipating starting a new registry with  more patients in  so the investment continues at a high level i think the real inflection point will be when we get to the us launch and we get cash flows from the us launch we get volume push through our factories we start to get more favorable gross margin profiles and leverage in our commercial footprint so it really is going to be associated with the launch ramp operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris pasquale from jpmorgan your line is now open chris t pasquale  jpmorgan securities llc thanks scott i wanted to start with stellarex and the clinical results youre expecting this year the first data set were going to see is the global registry given the fact that thats real world experience is it fair to assume that the patients are going to be more challenging than what we see in the randomized trials and as a result the results may not be quite as clean or do you think the patient profile is similar scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah its a great question chris well see when we see it quite frankly i think the data set is going to be more specific as it relates to the randomized trial and the pivotal trial respectively so for the registry time will tell on that front and were excited to get that data set out coming out in the april timeframe chris t pasquale  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then at our conference last month you hinted at some new clinical activity you guys could have starting this year you didnt announce anything in particular today can you talk a little bit about the priorities you have and when we could see something more formal announced and in particular im thinking about anything that could add to the evidence supporting the use of atherectomy and dcbs together that seems like a hole that still needs to be filled going forward scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think thats right chris and i think thats what you can expect to see in what were calling our saber registry that registry is slated to be up to  patients – real world patients and i think were going to be exploring what is required from a vessel preparation standpoint with different categories of patients i think thats going to be very helpful from a clinical practice perspective the other big initiative going on is the development of the technology for the belowtheknee device and the belowtheknee study and that work is ongoing right now and we anticipate hopefully beginning enrollment in the belowtheknee study late this year so those are the big efforts and youre exactly right in terms of both atherectomy and perhaps broader in other forms of vessel preparation in conjunction with stellarex really trying to show the right algorithms for different patients operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike matson from needham  company your line is now open mike s matson  needham  co llc hi thanks for taking my questions so i guess i just wanted to go back to the revenue guidance so stacy i think you said you were basing that off of – at least the midpoint off of where youre kind of exiting the year but i guess it seems like the comps are going to be getting significantly easier as you progress through  youve got a number of new products out so i guess why couldnt you kind of grow faster for the full year than the guidance that youve given stacy powell mcmahan  chief financial officer well let me generally talk about the growth during the year we expect that our quarterly performance would be within the range of the guidance that weve given and with some modest ramp later in the year as our product launches do gain traction so that really is encompassed by that range of guidance that weve given mike s matson  needham  co llc okay got it and then just on the bridge product i mean i understand that that will obviously make the physicians more willing to take leads out because it removes sort of the fear factor but is there an opportunity there to generate revenue with the product in other words does that kind of command a premium over your regular products and drive some revenue scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah mike itll be a new product thats being used in the case so you can anticipate that there will be some effect from the product i dont think its going to be profound i think the real benefit of the device comes in the form as you mentioned in terms of the perception of the procedure both for the extracting physician and for the referring physician our research indicates that thats where the real benefit will lie and hopefully the commensurate volume increase that comes from that and as weve said i think very clearly we anticipate thats going to take time to unfold in the marketplace operator and our next question comes from the line of charles haff from craighallum your line is now open charles e haff  craighallum capital group llc hi thanks for taking my questions so in terms of the guidance stacy for angioscore are you saying that you expect angioscore revenues to be similar in  versus what they were in  did i hear you right there scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director thanks for the question were not getting granular on reporting the pieces of our vi portfolio going forward but we will continue to give you that qualitative commentary on the drivers and limiters as we have today so i would just bake that all in as to more of the vi portfolio commentary that i gave in the guidance charles e haff  craighallum capital group llc okay thanks and then most of my questions have been asked and answered but wanted to ask you about mechanical tools for lead management can you give us any color on the progress that youve made going into the market share for the other mechanical tool company have you made much progress there or is it more of maintaining share any help you can give us on that front scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah happy to charles the team has done a very nice job both in the us and europe of converting competitive share within the mechanical device category and it has contributed to that net of stocking mid singledigit growth that i referred to so im pleased with the progress thats been made on that front operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of suraj kalia from northland securities your line is now open suraj a kalia  northland securities inc good afternoon everyone thank you for taking my questions scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director good afternoon suraj suraj a kalia  northland securities inc so scott forgive me if i missed some of this just jumping in between a few calls in lead removal scott you cant help but miss that the fact that its just come to an absolute grinding halt i guess part of it is im just trying to understand is this just structural or is this just seasonal and the reason i ask is glidelight was at a  premium it seems like and again approximately it seems like when the price the whole thing was shifted growth came to a grinding halt nominal growth scott if i use the reverse lets say youll actually institute a price decline would it mean that more procedures would increase scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director so suraj i would just just for a point of clarification i wont kind of do anything other than try to make the numbers clear here when you net out the stocking effect we grew mid single digits and if thats grinding halt then so be it on that front but it was a mid singledigit growth category and i think the opportunity in lead management is one that were excited in in terms of being able to open up that market but i dont think youre going to see us call for it suraj our hope is that it happens and we see it in the rearview mirror so hopefully thats somewhat responsive to your question there suraj a kalia  northland securities inc and stacy again forgive me if i missed this just given at least some directional color in the office versus hospitalbased growth obviously there are disparities in reimbursement and the results and incentive for using atherectomy plus dcbs can you give us some color in your embedded guidance how youre looking at growth within these different segments stacy powell mcmahan  chief financial officer we have actually continued again with our sort of performance that we recently experienced where weve seen that growth balanced across those segments hospital and obl operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt miksic from ubs your line is now open matt miksic if your phone is on matt miksic  ubs securities llc sorry yeah sorry about that guys i had you on mute thanks so much for taking the question so i did have one question on the range that you gave and you just talked about some of the factors that would take you to the higher end and the middle end the lower end of that range and in terms of better performance of new products or im not sure if it was less intense or easing of some of the competitive lineups that youre facing can you talk maybe a little about what some of the – if its products or if its geographies or if its categories where you see as an opportunity for hitting the mid to higher end of the range – or higher end of the range i should say as i think you talked about in the prepared remarks i have one followup scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah happy to answer that matt i think the number of opportunities that we have to hit the mid or high end of the range would certainly include the new launches that we have of note turbopower would be on that list certainly the bridge device and the commensurate potential pull through of lead management products the stellarex belowtheknee product continuation of the abovetheknee launch in europe and the drugcoated angiosculpt product also in europe this year those are all really nice shots on goal and certainly leveraging the isr indication with turbopower would be on that list so multiple shots on goal there hopefully we were also clear on the other end with what we contemplated with the low end of the guidance but there is quite a nice number of new products that were launching and frankly i believe the clinical data also has the potential to have an impact on our european launch of the abovetheknee product matt miksic  ubs securities llc okay thats helpful and then the other was that youd mentioned something about – and i didnt catch the numbers exactly on the stocking there was a stocking order it was in a – it was something to do with lead management if you would quantify that or clarify whether that was in a prior year that you were going up against the comp or whether that was an order that happened in this year just to give an idea of what the impact was scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director yeah absolutely matt we had pretty tough comps both in q and q of  due to the launch of mechanical tools last year so when you just take a look at the business as reported or constant currency it was roughly flat on a yearoveryear basis if you normalize for stocking of mechanical tools you get to about a midsingledigit growth rate for lm in q matt miksic  ubs securities llc perfect okay thanks so much scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator and im showing no further questions in the queue at this time scott william drake  president chief executive officer  director excellent eric thank you

michaella good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on our call i will provide revenue highlights from the first quarter share context on our performance and progress on key initiatives stacy will review our financial results and then well open the line for questions the following revenue commentary reflects constant currency the first quarter was a solid start to the year our vascular intervention and lead management businesses both delivered doubledigit growth we are focused on commercial execution and the opportunities that lie ahead in the first quarter total company revenue increased  geographically us revenue increased  and international grew  our vascular business grew  over prior year growth was led by us peripheral atherectomy and our turbopower franchise coronary atherectomy was also a growth driver and were wellpositioned in the expanding complex disease segment internationally angiosculpt and stellarex were again our primary contributors of growth in lead management revenue increased  over prior year growth was largely driven by mechanical tools and complemented by the ongoing adoption of our bridge to surgery device as a reminder we will anniversary the bridge launch next quarter i am encouraged by the momentum in our business and pipeline in vascular intervention we are in the midst of expanding our clinical data compendium launching new products internationally and domestically and preparing for stellarex approval in the us our stellarex isr study is underway and were making progress towards the approval of our belowtheknee ide as we have shared were exploring additional markets and indications for our drugcoated balloon platform in europe we expanded activities associated with the commercialization of angiosculptx and commenced our stellarex belowtheknee launch angiosculptx combines  therapies into  device offering the plaque modification attributes of our proven angiosculpt platform with the added benefit of drug delivery european physicians have shared encouraging feedback on the device especially in challenging patients early clinician feedback on stellarex below the knee is positive customers have highlighted its superior deliverability and cross ability further they have expressed that performance coupled with our coating stability and lower drug dosage provide a compelling solution in the challenging anatomy associated with below the knee disease in the us we launched our turbopower french product during the quarter french is an important size for expanding access and utilization to a larger customer base regarding our stellarex pma submission progress is on track we continue to expect approval in the second half of  we believe our expanded commercial organization is prepared for the most important launch in the history of our company on the international front we see opportunities for growth in emerging markets especially bric nations in fact our first commercial peripheral atherectomy cases were performed in china during the quarter in lead management we are pleased with the growth in mechanical tools and the adoption of bridge we launched tightrail subc late in the quarter providing physicians a solution for calcified lesions in the subclavian area while early the product is performing well and customer feedback is positive as you know we launched bridge last year with the goal of improving both actual and perceived safety of lead extraction procedures prior to the introduction of bridge many physicians showed reluctance to perform extractions due to fear of an svc tear and the risk of patient mortality bridge has created a new dialogue with our customers notably reluctant extractors are sharing their increased confidence in doing cases feedback for moderatetohigh volume customers continues to be positive and we look forward to showcasing bridge and lead extraction at hrs next month internationally were introducing bridge into key european countries and are in the early stages of launching lead management into emerging markets overall we remain cautiously optimistic about the global growth prospects in lead management in summary we are pleased with doubledigit revenue growth in both businesses product launches across business lines and geographic regions are tracking nicely our expanded commercial footprint is maturing and clinical data enhances our competitive position i will now turn the call over to stacy to discuss our financial results stacy powell mcmahan thank you scott and good afternoon everyone i will begin by referring you to the press release issued this afternoon for details consolidated first quarter revenue was  million up  both as reported and in constant currency by geographic reporting segment our us revenue growth was  and international revenue growth was  as reported and  on a constantcurrency basis by line of business vascular intervention revenue was up  in both reported and constant currency lead management revenue was up  as reported and  in constant currency laser service and other revenue increased  as reported and  on a constantcurrency basis in vascular intervention peripheral and coronary atherectomy were the primary growth drivers in lead management growth was driven by mechanical tools and bridge in the us growth was primarily driven by an increase in disposables revenue internationally growth was again driven by angiosculpt and stellarex regarding laser placements we placed  lasers globally during the first quarter versus  last quarter and  a year ago  of these placements were redeployed within the field driving greater productivity from our installed base moving down to pl gross margin for the quarter was  the basis point decline from last year was driven primarily by sales mix and somewhat offset by favorable production efficiencies selling general and administrative expenses increased  versus prior year and represented  of sales the increase was primarily due to our globalcommercial footprint expansion rd spending increased  yearoveryear and represented  of our sales the increase was primarily driven by cost associated with our fda warning letter remediation and quality system improvement efforts partially offset by a reduction in development cost due to the approval of angiosculptx in the third quarter of  a total operating loss of  million in the quarter compares to a  million operating loss in the same quarter a year ago net loss for the quarter was  million or  per share versus a  million net loss or  per share in the prior years quarter cash on hand as of march   was  million cash used in operations during the first quarter was  million as a reminder q is our heaviest cash use this quarter of the  million about  million was annual performancebased cash compensation and the underlying operating cash burn was around  million lastly our full year guidance remains unchanged i will now turn the call back to scott for closing remarks scott william drake thanks stacy in summary im pleased with the broad base strength of our first quarter results we have much to look forward to within our existing portfolio and pipeline as we build out capabilities to capitalize on near and longterm opportunities shahriar matin our chief operating officer is also joining us for qa operator please open the lines for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well be taking our first question from the line of chris pasquale from guggenheim chris pasquale scott on stellarex can you just give us a little bit more color on where you stand with the agency at this point are there still outstanding questions about the filing that you need to respond to or youre just waiting now to hear back from them scott william drake were well down the path i would say chris in terms of the finalizing answering questions with the fda were not completely through with that but i think the second half of  the commentary stands at this point but i think its very well derisked as we are here today chris pasquale okay and then spend another minute on lead management because that was probably the biggest surprise this quarter and its actually been a couple of quarters now where weve seen that accelerating can you break down at all what you think has really changed there how much of it has been bridge itself contributing extra revenue per case versus maybe increased caseload because bridge is there as a safety net or is mechanical tools a bigger piece of it what do you think has really driven that acceleration scott william drake yes we are very pleased with the step up in lm growth in the first quarter its split pretty evenly between the growth in mechanical tools and the bridge device itself chris what i would say in terms of further color were seeing volume increases in low and moderate volume accounts that is being offset a little bit by highvolume accounts coming down a bit theres a slight net uptick in terms of procedures being done but a little bit of tradeoff there and this next comment is anecdotal what were hearing is increased comfort and confidence with those lower volume customers in doing cases that generally they may have referred to higher volume accounts so that was precisely what we were attempting to do with the device now the question is whether or not we can really open up the market given the effectiveness of it so that remains to be seen and well just reiterate again let us prove instead of project sustainability of real nice growth in lm operator our next question comes from the line of rick weiss from stifel matt blackman its actually matt blackman in for rick stacy maybe starting with you could you help us with the calendar this is a pretty clunky year if holiday is shifting from quartertoquarter so as we think about this just reported first quarter and the remainder of the year anything to sort of call out in terms of selling day differences stacy powell mcmahan yes matt there really is compared to last year is the third quarter where we have  fewer selling day otherwise were even matt blackman okay thats very helpful thanks and then scott shifting to the btk opportunity i realized in europe in and of itself btk is probably not a huge dollar opportunity but i cant help but think that given the fact that youre now the sort of  of  on labeled devices for btk versus  of  for sfa that this opportunity may have a positive halo effect for your european business more broadly is that a fair way to think about this scott william drake i think so matt i mean customers are pretty optimistic about what stellarex means for below the knee disease and i think they may have incrementally more confidence in stellarex than some of the other offerings that are currently in the market or on the market in europe i think it will also help us above the knee as were able to bring a total leg solution there but i wouldnt get overly optimistic in terms of modeling itll take us a little while to have the effect that we hope to have but i think it will help drive incremental growth in europe moving forward matt blackman okay and then just if i can sneak in one last quick one on the turbopower launch where are we in that rollout i suspect this could be a longertailed opportunity more than simply just  quarters and then you anniversary it could you maybe just if only directionally kind of give us a sense on where we are in that rollout scott william drake yes i think youre exactly right i mean the feedback from customers is such that its being very helpful competitively in the marketplace and were being told that its very useful and performing well in morphology that historically has really been seated to other companies so were pleased with the way thats going and i do think there is a tale to ongoing adoption as it relates to the turbopower family of products so i would agree with your assessment there and were pleased with where were at the french product has been in the market now matt for about a year french were just kind of getting underway with here more recently so we will have some benefit in the coming quarters but i again would agree with you that this is a longerterm opportunity than just anniversarying after a years launch operator our next question comes from the line of michael weinstein from jpmorgan well take our next question from the line of jason mills from canaccord genuity jason mills scott starting with stellarex youve confirmed on previous calls to many questions that youre prepared for this launch and you mentioned it again today i was wondering if you could characterize based on  im sure a ton of market research youve done internally i mean what the drugmoving blue market in the united states has done over the last couple of quarters from your perspective what kind of market do you think theyre going to be entering here in the second half of the year and i know that youve heard  well weve heard weve probably seen what weve seen with respect to medtronics propensity to try to use their breadth to maintain or gain share perhaps give us a sense on how you think you can successfully compete against that sort of a marketing strategy scott william drake yes happy to touch on those items jason i would say the market overall is unfolding very much in line with our commentary now over the past couple of years i think the us market in  is on track to be roughly a  million market and we know how share currently is split between really the  companies that are in the space  brands so i would say thats really unfolding how we anticipate it and i think in terms of how well be going to market versus others i would begin with the fact that weve got enormous respect for the companies that we compete with i think we do go to market in a slightly different way much more clinically focused versus breadth and bundling and contracting based and i wouldnt say one is inherently better than the other but weve been very clear for the past  years that we intend to have meaningful clinical solutions with level  data and thats how we go to market so it is a different approach i think its relatively appreciated by our customers but obviously our competitors are doing well also jason mills got it and sticking with stellarex what are your belowtheknee discussions with fda i think you filed that correct me if im wrong with the fda in q so i presume that youre not too far away from hearing back if you havent already and perhaps could be in a position this time next quarter on this call to talk about it is that the right timeline to think about and youve talked in the past about it being unique i think everyone on this call is really eager to hear what unique means any color on that scott william drake yes happy to jason youre exactly right we submitted in q we have addressed the study design with the fda and i think were in alignment as it relates to the study design were still working with the agency on the preclinical questions they very much want to understand whats going on below the knee theyre keenly aware of whats happened with other products in the market and outcomes of clinical studies that have not been successful so i think theyre being prudent in their approach and the thing that i would be comfortable sharing is that we are going to be addressing more complex patients which are really the kind of patients that our customers see with critical limb ischemia patients so thats what you can anticipate from us and as it relates to kind of first patient enrolled i would just say broadly at this point second half of  and hopefully well be able to give you a little more color jason next quarter operator our next question comes from the line of matt miksic from ubs we will go to the next person in the queue this ones from the line of ethan potasnick from needham  company ethan potasnick this is ethan potasnick phoning in for mike matson so im just curious do you guys plan to add sales reps after the launch of stellarex and i guess how will you guys ensure that reps dont lose focus on laser atherectomy and other products once stellarex is launched scott william drake yes ethan i would just characterize where were at currently with the sales force expansion weve shared previously that our goal is to get to somewhere in the  to  quotacarrying reps we have hired our last kind of tranche or bolus of reps and now were just kind of hiring in normal course and that will continue on really through the calendar year so that will go beyond the initial launch of stellarex were marching more toward effectivity and optimization versus trying to race the clock so the expansion will continue beyond the initial launch of the product we anticipate i think the team has done an incredibly thoughtful job in terms of preparing for the launch and contemplating how we can continue to grow the base business while we put the appropriate focus on stellarex and theres a lot of tools that we have in our armamentarium including compensation and training and different ways that we intend to go to market when we have stellarex in the bag i dont want to go into detail here for competitive reasons but rest assured it is something that weve thought very deeply about ethan potasnick okay and sorry if this is repetitive but have you guys seen any faster growth with stellarex outside the us i guess with the presentation of the us pivotal data scott william drake yes you know we dont break out specifically the growth rate of stellarex in europe what i would share with you is that our international vascular growth has been driven now for many quarters by both stellarex and our angiosculpt platform that continued here in q and the team is doing a very nice job of continuing to convert accounts over there so i would just characterize it as being a very nice growth driver for us and now we bring to it the addition of stellarex below the knee and were obviously in a pretty good position in france as well so i think theres some nice incremental drivers in front of us in europe there with our drugcoated balloon platform itd be remiss if i didnt mention angiosculptx as well very nice addition to our family of drugcoated products operator our next question comes from the line of suraj kalia from northland securities suraj kalia so scott forgive me ive been just hopping in between a few calls if some of this has been mentioned my apologies scott when you look at the current dcb market what does your internal analysis indicate by that i mean if i look at  buckets primarily dcbs plus laser dcbs without any atherectomy device or standalone and dcbs with some atherectomy device how does that look to you and the reason i ask is when stellarex gets launched i know the focus is on rep productivity and compensation im more interested in how you all see this venn diagram and how you could capitalize of it any color here would be great scott william drake yes id be happy to take a shot at that suraj i think the place to begin is the overall aim in the marketplace that is very clear and that is to achieve stentlike results without leaving an implant behind and i think there are kind of  to the point of your question emerging algorithms in physicians minds and admittedly it varies from  physician to the other around what kind of vessel preparation whether its atherectomy or scoring balloon would be used or if they would be prone to use dcb on a standalone basis its probably not as granular as you would like but i anticipate that we will see and in fact i do see in labs when i spend time with customers that in some instances theyre using just a bare balloon for predilatation followed by a drugcoated balloon it seems to me that theres an increasing propensity to use vessel preparation in some form ive seen laser used in many many cases prior to dcb and ive also seen our scoring balloon used as well and i think as our customers think more deeply about the indications of use and the complexity of disease and the desire for better patency numbers and longer durability of positive outcomes as you know weve been projecting for a long period of time that vessel preparation will grow in concert with drugcoated balloons it appears that that may be true certainly it is in europe and i project that it will be in the us market as well suraj kalia fair enough and finally scott ill hop back in queue i know not much has been said about angioscore contribution and youve sort of shied away over the last few quarters any color you all can give us how youre normalizing how does  how much of a drag does angioscore currently on the overall business scott william drake happy to address that one suraj its improved the growth rate of our angioscore franchise has improved over the past several quarters this quarter if im not mistaken we were in kind of highsingledigits growth overall with sculpt and the trends that weve talked about previously hold true europe growing faster than the us coronary growing faster than peripheral but we see an improvement there in terms of that category but youre exactly right it is growing slower than our overall vascular business operator our next question comes from the line of jayson bedford from raymond james jayson bedford just scott on that last point i may have missed this but angiosculpt you said grew high single digits in the quarter scott william drake thats right jayson bedford okay that seems like a noticeable pickup in terms of your peripheral atherectomy business has the growth profile been impacted at all by the onlabel use of dcbs for isr scott william drake yes its really interesting jason its still not obvious to us i know were so many quarters in the net effect on our atherectomy franchise still feels like roughly a net  as it relates to the impact of dcbs as ive said before and forgive the repetition here there are clearly cases where its being where laser atherectomy is being used in concert with dcb and theres clearly cases where dcbs are being used on a standalone basis but it still feels as though the net effect is roughly  we would anticipate over time and with data that i think will be forthcoming that chances are that it will be complimentary but we have not seen that as yet jayson bedford okay fair enough and just the comment on turbopower helping growth i wasnt sure if that was a comment specifically related to the french launch or was that just the family of turbopower products scott william drake yes the family of turbopower is really helping drive our peripheral atherectomy growth and that peripheral atherectomy was indeed one of our growth drivers in the overall vi business jayson bedford got it and then just maybe lastly for me you mentioned france are you selling stellarex in france right now is that contributing scott william drake it is not yet that will be in the nottoodistant future shar i could be wrong there you may want to correct me if we are jayson i can tell you its not moving the needle shar do we have first sales in france as yet shar shahriar matin yes we do have sales in france but to your point its pretty marginal because reimbursement is a challenge so if theres a way to bundle we can get it but private hospitals dont get reimbursement and some public hospitals will have a small budget for it once reimbursement is in place we expect that market to pick up similar to a perimental stents where its the largest market in europe for perimental stents operator our next question comes from the line of glenn novarro from rbc capital markets glenn novarro scott just wanted a clarification on the sales force expansion you said  to  reps thats the goal are you there now or do you anticipate getting there with these additional hires and then can you just remind us how your numbers would compare to like a medtronic and a bard scott william drake yes happy to glenn were not quite there yet we anticipate that well get there by the end of the calendar year but again were more interested in quality than speed as it relates to that and trying very carefully not to disrupt the business as we do an inherently disruptive thing and thus far the team has managed it i would say very well and as it relates to competitive sales forces within this space i think were at a bit of an advantage relative to bard i think were a bit larger i think were getting to relative parity relative to medtronic we are smaller than boston scientific thats our best intel glenn and hope thats helpful glenn novarro yes that is and then i think most of us are assuming the drugcoated balloon gets approved at some point in the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be your first full quarter on the market so scott im wondering if you can help frame or provide some color as to how you see that first quarter ramping up is it a measured launch do you have to put a lot of contracts in place any color for that first quarter because its always a critical quarter for any new product story scott william drake yes happy to and an incredibly challenging question to answer with precision as you can appreciate i would start big picture glenn and tell you that weve got a good deal of confidence in the share position that we will ultimately get to with stellarex given the data that we have and given the commercial footprint that we have in the marketplace and our research indicates that we will ultimately take a very attractive position in the dcb market trying to predict that ramp with accuracy i think would be a mistake for us and as a result of that i think were just going to be muted in terms of setting expectations on that front to the part of your question regarding market access that will vary from account to account there will be accounts that we have to go through contracting processes there will be other accounts where well be able to sell trunk stock on the first day of our launch so it will be across the board but market access will be one of the primary efforts that we have out of the gates and that will mitigate the steepness of that curve but were contemplating that in terms of what the launch plans look like operator our next question comes from the line of mike weinstein from jpmorgan mike weinstein i just wanted to come back to a couple of items so maybe if i could go first with the last question there from glenn were assuming that depending on  the timing was going to dictate kind of that pace of that ramp because if you actually did an approval sooner rather than later youre still going to have to go through hospital committees to get approvals do you have any sense or percentage of accounts in which youll have to do that you seem to indicate there will be accounts where you wont but ive been assuming that you would scott william drake i think thats right mike i still think even accounts with value analysis committees i would anticipate that well be able to do some kind of trials in those accounts to get the product in physicians hands but i think in the vast majority of cases well have to get through a value analysis committee and i think youve written very smartly about the fact that those in the summertime tend not to happen quite as frequently i think on average value analysis committees meet bimonthly or so but i think that will be one of the hurdles certainly that weve got to get through mike weinstein and our work on the market has  had been kind of suggested that there is a spread in the pricing between the  products that are out there today i just want to get your own perception of what that spread looks like scott william drake yes our data suggest that its within about  box of one another id be curious to know if you see it differently than that and were contemplating what may happen as we enter the market if anybody chooses to pull the price lever or not i dont think anybody will do that significantly mike as the market is expanding very attractively price pressure tends not to happen until the market reaches some kind of maturity point and i think that is a little way off mike weinstein and just to  after a question from  i dont think i heard who asked but are you expecting anything any type of legal response from any competitors when you get to your approval scott william drake we are not mike weinstein okay i assumed that was the case but i dont think i ever heard it asked so i wanted to double check operator well be taking our next question from the line of matt miksic from ubs matt miksic so i wanted to follow up on a couple of things that have been asked but maybe a little bit more detail one was on bridge and on the results youve seen there which sounds very encouraging if you could just remind us we hear often that clinicians like to have the bridge on hand and i wanted to get a sense of i guess how  if its driving growth is it driving growth in the core laser sheets business and thats where the revenue is coming from or to what degree is it driving growth from utilization of actually bridge opening it up and using it id love to get a sense of that and then i have a couple of other quick followups scott william drake yes matt what i would say in q the growth that we drove was really on both mechanical tools and the sale of the bridge product itself what we see that is new and i would be very muted and careful with this is that we are seeing procedural volume increasing in low and moderate volume accounts that to some degree is being offset by volumes coming down slightly in highvolume accounts so a slight net positive there and the goal with the device obviously is to save lives but also to help us open up the market for the benefit of shareholders and patients and there is a light signal that we may be beginning i would underline beginning to do that i dont want to get carried away with that i think weve got a lot more to prove but we were hearing just what you are that physicians really want to have the product in the room and to varying degrees they all have their thoughts on when they want to have bridge actually deployed for cases prophylactically but the response from customers is incredibly positive as it relates to the product matt miksic thats great thats very helpful then a follow up on the vascular business and i think what youve been getting a lot of questions on is sort of the pace of the prospective launch postapproval of stellarex and understanding that that  weve heard all your answers there id love to get a sense of to what degree should we be thinking that the core business maybe takes a half a step to the side while everyone is busy training or to the extent participating or  in these committees or detailing this new exciting product how should we think about the core business and if its okay i just have  other quick followup scott william drake sure i would say the overall  the core business has been performing pretty well you see us the last several quarters with the little variation here or there growing roughly at twice the market rate the team being able to do that while were in the midst of sales force expansion and without yet stellarex approved i would say is solid performance we have seen when others have launched their product maybe a little slowdown in their base business growth weve tried to learn from them and contemplate how we can mitigate that risk but youre absolutely right to point out that that risk exists and were trying to be very thoughtful in terms of how we contemplate that in our guidance and well continue to attempt to do that as we go forward matt miksic okay and then the last just on charing cross i mean any significant indiscernible scott william drake matt youre breaking up a little bit there but i think your question is around charing cross shar is actually in london at the conference shar any color in terms of interesting things that you saw at the show that would be interesting for the audience here shahriar matin i think the biggest takeaway as far as drugcoated balloons that we kept hearing from thought leaders on the podium was there is a no class effect especially with the data that weve released our two randomized studies and medtronics additional data thats coming out and just some analyses and whatnot really a lot of thought leaders are making it clear that there is no drugcoated balloon class effect and each drugcoated balloon stands on its own so i think thats been my biggest takeaway at the meeting operator operator instructions looks like we have no other questioners in the queue at this time id like to turn the call back over to scott for closing comments scott william drake excellent thank you very much thanks everybody for joining us today on the call i look forward to talking again in another  days have a good evening operator ladies and gentlemen thank you again for your participation in todays conference call this now
