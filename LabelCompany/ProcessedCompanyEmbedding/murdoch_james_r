britain postponed its regulatory review of st century fox’s proposal to take full control of the company until after the country’s general election in june credit daniel lealolivasagence francepresse — getty images london — sky the british satellite television giant has been a most elusive crown jewel for the murdoch familythe last time a company led by rupert murdoch tried to acquire sky it was news corporation and the deal was abandoned amid a phone hacking scandal now mr murdoch the executive cochairman of st century fox and his sons james and lachlan are again vying for control of the  percent of sky shares that st century fox does not already own and again there are calls for british regulators to consider a scandal this one involving sex harassment allegations at fox news channel in the united states that led to the ousters of roger e ailes the network’s longtime chairman and bill o’reilly its top staron friday britain postponed its regulatory review of st century fox’s proposal to take full control of sky until after the country’s general election in june the regulator the office of communications or ofcom is reviewing the potential effects of the potential acquisition on competition in the media industry and also assessing whether the combined company would be “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting licensethe government cited a shifting political timetable as the reason for the delay prime minister theresa may issued a surprise call on tuesday for early elections to be held on june  when a general election approaches officials enter a period known as purdah during which they avoid announcements that risk influencing the outcome of the coming vote advertisement continue reading the main story but the sexual harassment scandal at fox news has cast a shadow over the british review and vice versa critics of the murdochs have been eager to draw the connection continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story in a letter to ofcom last week lisa bloom a lawyer representing wendy walsh one of mr o’reilly’s accusers wrote that “the similarities between the current harassment scandal and the phonehacking scandal reveal the company’s approach to business and management — a lack of oversight intervention and decency”in its own letter to ofcom color of change an activist group that promotes racial justice called st century fox “a company with a deepseated culture of systemic racial and sexual abuse”mr o’reilly has said the claims against him are unfoundedclaire enders founder of enders analysis a media and telecom industry research company in london said it was “inconceivable” that mr o’reilly’s departure this week was unconnected to the scrutiny surrounding the takeover“i am sure that ofcom has asked questions about every single misconduct issue anywhere in the world and above all in the us” she saidms enders and other analysts believe that the deal will ultimately be approved but it is also clear that sky is an asset the murdochs do not want to risk losing out on a second time that appears to be particularly true of james murdoch who is the chief executive of st century fox and the chairman of sky“it will set up his future as a chief executive officer” ms enders saidsky is both a giant cable and broadband provider in britain and a producer of shows like “the young pope” the jude law vehicle that sky developed with hbo and canal it has divisions in italy and germany and deals with britain’s premier league and the bundesliga soccer league in germany its sky atlantic channel has rights to american hits like “game of thrones”from a business perspective the timing of the deal is goodsky has a reasonable valuation and it has become highly profitable it also has direct experience with consumers that st century fox lacks as a provider of cable and broadband services and through nowtv its rival to netflix that expertise is valuable at a time when many consumers are abandoning bundled cable offerings advertisement continue reading the main story “a generic problem for a lot of media companies everywhere in the uk or the us is how do you crack the directtoconsumer nut” said thomas singlehurst an analyst at citigroup “and here is a company that has been doing it very successfully and that’s part of the consideration alongside the cheap valuation the weak sterling and the fact that the group just throws off a lot of cash” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must

singlehurst said he expected that the government would ultimately approve the deal“at the end of the day you do have to have proper evidence of something that has gone wrong and that evidence has to have been provided definitively one way or the other most likely in a court of law” he saidwith the fitandproper test ofcom is trying to determine whether the people who would be running the company are fit to do so while relatively rare the test is familiar to the murdochs the last such review by ofcom began in  and also examined the fitness of sky then called british sky broadcasting amid a bid by news corporation to acquire full control of the companynews corporation has since split into two companies including st century fox sky ultimately passed the review but james murdoch was criticized in ofcom’s report for mishandling the hacking matter and the proposed acquisition was abandonedofcom which is independent will provide its latest report to karen bradley the british minister for culture media and sport who will decide whether to abide by its recommendations ms bradley who previously called for the competition review to be completed by may  said in a statement on friday that she was extending the deadline to june  “given the proximity of this decision to the forthcoming general election”it is not even certain that the review of the pending sky deal would encompass actions that have taken place in the united states“we’ve been listening to a range of views around what we should consider relevant to the current ‘fit and proper test’” said joe smithies a spokesman for ofcomspeaking generally mr smithies added “we have an ongoing duty to be satisfied that holders of our broadcasting licenses are fit and proper and that duty is a legal obligation from the broadcasting act and it’s something we take very seriously”“in considering whether any licensee is fit and proper we would take into account any relevant misconduct of those who manage and control a broadcast licensee” he said advertisement continue reading the main story tom watson the deputy leader of the opposition labour party said in a statement that it was “important that full and proper process is followed in the assessment of this bid”“i have consistently argued ofcom must consider the serious and systemic corporate governance failures at fox as part of its inquiry into whether the company should be allowed to take full control of sky” he addeda spokeswoman for st century fox pointed to previous statements by the company one said the company was “confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process” a second said that the company “takes its regulatory and compliance obligations very seriously we have a strong record of compliance in all our markets including in the uk”sky declined to comment continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage fears of revolt by

reliable sources think profit newtube entertainment follow us back to cnnmoney james murdoch says empire pepsi story hits the spot by brian stelter   brianstelter november    pm et pepsis insertion into foxs hit show empire is exactly what james murdoch wants to see more of murdoch whos been the ceo of st century fox for nearly five months is becoming more and more vocal about how the tv advertising model has to change — and fast his view is that consumers are less and less willing to accept three or four minutes of ads interrupting their favorite shows every seven or eight minutes what we havent seen enough of is a lot of ad innovation he said at a paley center conference thursday morning murdoch praised the producers of empire for a creative collaboration with pepsi that started on wednesday nights show and will continue for several weeks it involves a character shooting a commercial for pepsi and the finished product will eventually air right inside the episode its not something thats inauthentic murdoch said its something that works in the narrative of the show and pushes the narrative forward related james on lachlan murdoch i dont think we bicker he pointed out that a product integration like pepsis cant be avoided through ad fastforwarding murdoch wants more experimentation a la hulus new adfree option which lets streaming tv subscribers pay an extra  a month to remove practically all the ads from the service at the conference on thursday murdoch said he couldnt reveal specifics about how many people have paid for it but he said the adfree option has conditioned users to think differently about the service as a whole once you give people the choice he said the people who stay with the limited ad load complain less about the ads because theyve actually consciously made that choice related rupert murdoch to turn over fox to his sons he said they perceive that by sitting through the ads im saving  we shouldnt be afraid of that murdoch said we should always trust the customers murdoch praised another hulu feature the choice to view one long special ad before a show to avoid any interruptions later you actually end up thanking the sponsor for giving you an adfree experience he said hulu has been pioneering such changes to the ad model for years but now with murdoch making the subject a priority it is getting more attention media executives like murdoch are increasingly concerned that netflix  which is adfree  is conditioning a generation of viewers to want tv without interruptions related empire reigns with huge season  premiere murdoch said the industry should not give up on advertising in any way but must work hard to earn the attention of customers his comments doubled as an argument for why tvstyle advertising should be more highly valued than digital ads on sprawling social networks on facebook streaming tv sites like hulu can offer immersive fullscreen experiences he said while barelyvisible ads on
