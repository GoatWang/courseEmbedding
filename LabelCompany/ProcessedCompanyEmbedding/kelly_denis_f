art of the nude is treated as something much more special located even further away from the potential of arousal artporn argues that these distinctions are based on an ageold antithesis between sight

visual and visceral pleasure images compel the senses in ways that are both taboo and intrinsic to art contemporary responses to images of the nude embody this longstanding tension our fears about the materiality of art when in close proximity to our own bodies exist in tandem with a regulation of sensory response which dates back to antiquity artporn reveals howfrom fondling statues in antiquity
