the parties is to jointly accelerate deployment and adoption of wimax products and services in the united states across a broad array of devices for use on the clearwire communications network by the deployment of the clearwire communications network and subject to applicable law by providing incentives to oems and odms to incorporate wimax chipsets into devices in commercial quantities as soon as

intel and clearwire communications also among other things are agreeing to certain appropriate  commitments subject to applicable law to accelerate the deployment and adoption of wimax products and services by oems and odms  both parties understand that their efforts to accelerate deployment and adoption of wimax products and services are among other things dependent on competitive pricing of wimax chipsets and wimax broadband services that are sufficiently low to encourage oems and odms to incorporate wimax chipsets into a large segment of oem and odm device product lines and to encourage
