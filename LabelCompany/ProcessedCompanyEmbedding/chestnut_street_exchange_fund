price may decline special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors to the extent the fund focuses on particular countries regions industries sectors or types of investment from time to time it may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas of focus than a fund that invests in a wider variety of countries regions industries sectors or investments  smaller midsized and relatively new or unseasoned

distributions by the fund as a ric that are attributable to ordinary income and shortterm capital gains of the fund will generally be taxable as ordinary income in determining a partners gross income for tax purposes regardless whether the partner receives these distributions in cash or shares the fund currently intends to retain all of its net realized longterm capital gains and pay the tax on the gain at the required corporate rate    table of contents item  financial intermediary compensation inapplicable   item  investment objectives principal investment strategies related risks and disclosure of portfolio holdings     a the funds investment objectives are to seek longterm growth of capital and secondarily current income the investment objectives stated above may be changed by the board of managing general partners without the approval of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities     b the fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks and securities convertible into common stocks of companies with large market capitalizations the fund may also invest in other types of securities for temporary or defensive purposes including preferred stocks investment grade bonds and money market obligations such as us government securities certificates of deposit and commercial paper to the extent that the fund is in a temporary or defensive position it may not be able to meet its investment objectives generally because many of the funds portfolio securities have significant capital appreciation

negatively affected by industry andor economic trends and developments the prices of securities issued by such    table of contents   companies may suffer a decline in response these factors

pay its liabilities recipients of distributions from the fund could be liable to creditors of the fund to the extent of such distributions plus interest a limited partner has no right to take any part in the control of the partnership business and the exercise of such control would subject a limited partner to the personal liability of a general partner for obligations of the fund it is possible that the existence or exercise by the limited partners of the voting rights provided in the partnership agreement might subject the limited partners to liability as general partners under the laws of california and other states in the event that a limited partner should be found to be liable as a general partner then to the extent the assets and insurance of the fund and of the general partners were insufficient to reimburse a limited partner he would be required to personally satisfy claims of creditors against the fund the net asset value of the funds shares on redemption or repurchase

company taxable income before the deduction of such dividends the fund intends to retain all of its net longterm capital gains the fund may decide to distribute up to all of its net longterm capital gains in the future     e frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares the board of managing general partners has not adopted formal policies and procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares by fund shareholders due to the nature of the fund and the nature of the procedures for redeeming the funds shares     f tax consequences under the publicly traded partnership rules of the code the fund has been treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes since january   however the fund has elected and intends to continue to qualify as a ric under the code the codes ric provisions provide passthrough treatment of taxable income similar to that provided under the codes partnership rules therefore to the extent that the funds earnings are distributed to its partners as required by the ric provisions of the code the fund itself will not be required to pay federal income tax distributions by the fund as a ric that are attributable to ordinary income and shortterm capital gains of the fund will generally be taxable as ordinary income in determining a partners gross income for tax purposes regardless whether the partner receives these distributions in cash or shares the fund currently intends to retain all of its net realized longterm capital gains and pay the tax on the gain at the required corporate rate each partner will be required to report his allocable portion of the funds gain but each partner will also receive a tax credit for his allocable portion of the tax paid by the fund in addition any retained capital gains net of tax will generally increase a partners investment and tax basis in the fund the fund will inform each partner as to the amount and nature of such income or gains formerly the fund when it was taxed as a partnership distributed approximately  of its net longterm capital gains to provide its partners who were taxable on all of such gains with funds with which to pay the capital gains tax the current policy is designed to achieve substantially the same result the fund may change this policy in the future    table of contents under the code the current maximum longterm capital gain tax rate applicable to individuals estates and trusts is  fund distributions to individual partners attributable to dividends received by the fund from us and certain qualified foreign corporations will generally be taxed at the longterm capital gain rate as long as certain other requirements are met for these lower rates to apply the individual partners must have owned their fund shares for at least  days during the day period beginning on the date that is  days before the funds exdividend date and the fund will need to have met a similar holding period requirement with respect to the shares of the corporation paying the qualifying dividend the amount of the funds distributions that qualify for this favorable tax treatment may be reduced as a result of the funds securities lending activities if any a high portfolio turnover rate or investments in debt securities or nonqualified foreign corporations some of the tax provisions described above are subject to sunset provisions specifically the  longterm capital gain rate is scheduled to increase to  and dividends will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates rather than at the longterm capital gain rate for taxable years beginning after december   when a partner purchases shares just before a distribution the purchase price will reflect the amount of the upcoming distribution but the partner will be taxed on the entire amount of the distribution received even though as an economic matter the distribution simply constitutes a return of capital this is known as buying into a dividend partners will generally recognize taxable gain or loss on a sale exchange or redemption of their shares based on the difference between their tax basis in the shares and the amount received for them generally partners recognize longterm capital gain or loss if they have held their fund shares for over twelve months at the time they dispose of them to aid in computing the tax basis in the shares partners generally should retain their account statements for the period during which they have held shares any loss realized on shares held for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends that were received on the shares additionally any loss realized on a disposition of shares of the fund may be disallowed under wash sale rules to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced with other shares of the fund within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the shares are disposed of such as pursuant to a dividend reinvestment in shares of the fund if disallowed the loss will be reflected in an upward adjustment to the basis of the shares acquired the one major exception to these tax principles is that distributions on and sales exchanges and redemptions of shares held in an ira or other taxqualified plan will not be currently taxable    table of contents the above federal tax discussion relates

voting guidelines for us securities   these guidelines should be read in conjunction with blackrocks global corporate governance and engagement principles   introduction blackrock inc and its subsidiaries collectively blackrock seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and promote the economic value of the securities held in client accounts the following issuespecific proxy voting guidelines the guidelines are intended to summarize blackrocks general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context for us securities these guidelines are not intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how blackrock will vote in every instance rather they share our view about corporate governance issues generally and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots they are applied with discretion taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company and the individual ballot item voting guidelines these guidelines are divided into six key themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders the six key themes are        boards and directors        auditors and auditrelated issues        capital structure mergers asset sales and other special transactions        remuneration and benefits        social ethical and environmental issues        general corporate governance matters boards and directors director elections blackrock generally supports board nominees in most uncontested elections blackrock may withhold votes from certain directors on the board or members of particular board committees or prior members as the case may be in certain situations including but not limited to        the independent chair or lead independent director and members of the governance committee where a board fails to implement shareholder proposals that receive a majority of votes cast at a prior shareholder meeting and the     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities     proposals in our view have a direct and substantial impact on shareholders fundamental rights or longterm economic interests        the independent chair or lead independent director and members of the governance committee where a board implements or renews a poison pill without seeking shareholder approval beforehand or within a reasonable period of time after implementation        an insider or affiliated outsider who sits on any of the boards key committees ie audit compensation nominating and governance which we believe generally should be entirely independent however blackrock will examine a boards complete profile when questions of independence arise prior to casting a withhold vote for any director for controlled companies as defined by the us stock exchanges we will only vote against insiders or affiliates who sit on the audit committee but not other key committees        members of the audit committee during a period when the board failed to facilitate quality independent auditing for example if substantial accounting irregularities suggest insufficient oversight by that committee        members of the audit committee during a period in which we believe the company has aggressively accounted for its equity compensation plans        members of the compensation committee during a period in which executive compensation appears excessive relative to performance and peers and where we believe the compensation committee has not already substantially addressed this issue        members of the compensation committee where the company has repriced options without contemporaneous shareholder approval        the chair of the nominating committee or where no chair exists the nominating committee member with the longest tenure where board members at the most recent election of directors have received withhold votes from more than  of shares voting and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder concerns this may not apply in cases where blackrock did not support the initial withhold vote        the chair of the nominating committee or where no chair exists the nominating committee member with the longest tenure where the board is not composed of a majority of independent directors however this would not apply in the case of a controlled company        where blackrock obtains evidence that casts significant doubt on a directors qualifications or ability to represent shareholders        where it appears the director has acted at the company or at other companies in a manner that compromises his or her reliability in representing the best longterm economic interests of shareholders     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities        where a director has a pattern over a period of years of attending less than  of combined board and applicable key committee meetings        where a director has committed himself or herself to service on a large number of boards such that we deem it unlikely that the director will be able to commit sufficient focus and time to a particular company commonly referred to as overboarding while each situation will be reviewed on a casebycase basis blackrock is most likely to withhold votes for overboarding where a director is  serving on more than four public company boards or  is a chief executive officer at a public company and is serving on more than two public company boards in addition to the board of the company where they serve as chief executive officer if a board maintains a classified structure it is possible that the directors with whom we have a particular concern may not be subject to election in the year that the concern arises in such situations if we have a concern regarding a committee or committee chair we generally register our concern by withholding votes from all members of the relevant committee who are subject to election that year director independence we expect that a board should be majority independent we believe that an independent board faces fewer conflicts and is best prepared to protect shareholder interests common impediments to independence in the us include but are not limited to        employment by the company or a subsidiary as a senior executive within the previous five years        status as a founder of the company        substantial business or personal relationships with the company or the companys senior executives within the past three years        family relationships with senior executives of the company        an equity ownership in the company in excess of  age limits  term limits we typically oppose limits on the pool of directors from which shareholders can choose their representatives especially where those limits are arbitrary or unrelated to the specific performance or experience of the director in question board size we generally defer to the board in setting the appropriate size we believe directors are generally in the best position to assess what size is optimal to ensure a boards effectiveness however we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for effective shareholder representation or too large to function efficiently     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   classified board of directorsstaggered terms a classified board of directors is one that is divided into classes generally three each of which is elected on a staggered schedule generally for three years at each annual meeting only a single class of directors is subject to reelection generally onethird of the entire board we believe that classification of the board dilutes shareholders right to evaluate promptly a boards performance and limits shareholder selection of their representatives by not having the mechanism to immediately address concerns we may have with any specific director we may be required to register our concerns through our vote on the directors who are subject to election that year see director elections for additional detail furthermore where boards are classified director entrenchment is more likely because review of board service generally only occurs every three years therefore we typically vote against classification and for proposals to eliminate board classification contested director elections most director elections are not competitive but shareholders are sometimes presented with competing slates of director candidates generally such proxy contests are the result of a shareholder or group of shareholders seeking to change the companys strategy or address failures in the boards oversight of management the details of proxy contests are assessed on a casebycase basis we evaluate a number of factors which may include but are not limited to the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates the validity of the concerns identified by the dissident the viability of both the dissidents and managements plans the likelihood that the dissidents solutions will produce the desired change and whether the dissidents represent the best option for enhancing long term shareholder value cumulative voting for directors cumulative voting allocates one vote for each share of stock held times the number of directors subject to election a shareholder may cumulate hisher votes and cast all of them in favor of a single candidate or split them among any combination of candidates by making it possible to use their cumulated votes to elect at least one board member cumulative voting is typically a mechanism through which minority shareholders attempt to secure board representation we typically oppose proposals that further the candidacy of minority shareholders whose interests do not coincide with our fiduciary responsibility we may support cumulative voting proposals at companies where the board is not majority independent director compensation and equity programs we believe that compensation for independent directors should be structured to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders whom the directors have been elected to represent we believe that independent director compensation packages based on the companys longterm performance and that include some form of longterm equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal therefore we typically support proposals to provide such compensation packages however we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requiring directors to own a minimum amount of     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   company stock as we believe that companies should maintain flexibility in administering compensation and equity programs for independent directors given each companys and directors unique circumstances as discussed in further detail under the heading equity compensation plans below we believe that companies should prohibit directors from engaging in transactions with respect to their long term compensation that might disrupt the intended economic alignment between equity plan beneficiaries and shareholders indemnification of directors and officers we generally support reasonable but balanced protection of directors and officers we believe that failure to provide protection to directors and officers might severely limit a companys ability to attract and retain competent leadership we generally support proposals to provide indemnification that is limited to coverage of legal expenses however we may oppose proposals that provide indemnity for breaches of the duty of loyalty transactions from which a director derives an improper personal benefit and actions or omissions not in good faith or those that involve intentional misconduct majority vote requirements blackrock generally supports proposals seeking to require director election by majority vote majority voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives we note that majority voting is not appropriate in all circumstances for example in the context of a contested election we also recognize that some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast and we believe that such a requirement can be generally equivalent to a majority voting regime where we believe that the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism separation of chairman and ceo positions we believe that independent leadership is important in the board room in the us there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership  an independent chairman or  a lead independent director we generally consider the designation of a lead independent director as an acceptable alternative to an independent chair if the lead independent director has a term of at least one year and has powers to  set board meeting agendas  call meetings of the independent directors and  preside at meetings of independent directors where a company does not have a lead independent director that meets these criteria we generally support the separation of chairman and ceo shareholder access to the proxy we believe that shareholders should have the opportunity when necessary and under reasonable conditions to nominate individuals to stand for election to the boards of the companies they own in our view securing a right of shareholders to nominate directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders ability to participate meaningfully in     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   the director election process stimulate board attention to shareholder interests and provide shareholders an effective means of directing that attention where it is lacking auditors and auditrelated issues blackrock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements that provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a companys financial condition consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors we seek to hold the audit committee of the board responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function at a company and may withhold votes from the audit committees members where the board has failed to facilitate quality independent auditing we take particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures the integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role to that end we favor an independent auditor in addition to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a significant financial restatement or the audit firm has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders we may also vote against ratification from time to time shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms we may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above capital structure proposals blank check preferred we frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting conversion dividend distribution and other rights blank check preferred stock because they may serve as a transfer of authority from shareholders to the board and a possible entrenchment device we generally view the boards discretion to establish voting rights on a whenissued basis as a potential antitakeover device as it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to management thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote nonetheless where the company appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for antitakeover purposes has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings or has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further antitakeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility we may support the proposal equal voting rights blackrock supports the concept of equal voting rights for all shareholders some management proposals request authorization to allow a class of common stock to have superior voting rights over the existing common or to allow a class of common to elect a majority of the board we oppose such differential voting power as it may have the effect of denying shareholders the opportunity to vote on matters of critical economic importance to them     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   however when a shareholder proposal requests to eliminate an existing dualclass voting structure we seek to determine whether this action is warranted at that company at that time and whether the cost of restructuring will have a clear economic benefit to shareholders we evaluate these proposals on a casebycase basis and we consider the level and nature of control associated with the dualclass voting structure as well as the companys history of responsiveness to shareholders in determining whether support of such a measure is appropriate increase in authorized common shares blackrock considers industry specific norms in our analysis of these proposals as well as a companys history with respect to the use of its common shares generally we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firms business the most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is not in the economic interests of shareholders increase or issuance of preferred stock these proposals generally request either authorization of a class of preferred stock or an increase in previously authorized preferred stock preferred stock may be used to provide management with the flexibility to consummate beneficial acquisitions combinations or financings on terms not necessarily available via other means of financing we generally support these proposals in cases where the company specifies the voting dividend conversion and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable stock splits and reverse stock splits we generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share we generally support reverse splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock where the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value eg one class is reduced while others remain at presplit levels in the event of a proposal to reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the companys authorized stock we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock mergers asset sales and other special transactions in reviewing merger and asset sale proposals blackrocks primary concern is the best longterm economic interests of shareholders while these proposals vary widely in scope and substance we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses the varied nature of these proposals ensures that the following list will be incomplete however the key factors that we typically evaluate in considering these proposals include        for mergers and asset sales we assess the degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the companys trading price in order to filter out the effects of premerger news leaks on the parties share prices we consider a share price from multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger announcement in most cases business combinations should provide a premium we may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities     parties financial advisors and our own valuation assessments for companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy a premium may not apply        there should be a favorable business reason for the combination        unanimous board approval and armslength negotiations are preferred we will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an armslength bidding process we may also consider whether executive andor board members financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders interests before their own        we prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions poison pill plans also known as shareholder rights plans these plans generally involve issuance of call options to purchase securities in a target firm on favorable terms the options are exercisable only under certain circumstances usually accumulation of a specified percentage of shares in a relevant company or launch of a hostile tender offer these plans are often adopted by the board without being subject to shareholder vote poison pill proposals generally appear on the proxy as shareholder proposals requesting that existing plans be put to a vote this vote is typically advisory and therefore nonbinding we generally vote in favor of shareholder proposals to rescind poison pills where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote our policy is to examine these plans individually although we oppose most plans we may support plans that include a reasonable qualifying offer clause such clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed these clauses also tend to specify that an all cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or the board to seek the written consent of shareholders where shareholders could rescind the pill in their discretion we may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns proxy contests and other public campaigns can be valuable mechanisms for holding boards of underperforming companies accountable to their shareholders however these campaigns can also lead to unwarranted cost and distraction for boards and management teams and may be imposed by investors whose interests are not aligned with other investors therefore we generally do not support proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign as we believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   remuneration and benefits we note that there are both management and shareholder proposals related to executive compensation that appear on corporate ballots we generally vote on these proposals as described below except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is sufficient to address the issue we may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the companys history suggests that the issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company advisory resolutions on executive compensation say on pay in cases where there is a say on pay vote blackrock will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to shareholders we believe that compensation committees are in the best position to make compensation decisions and should maintain significant flexibility in administering compensation programs given their knowledge of the wealth profiles of the executives they seek to incentivize the appropriate performance measures for the company and other issues internal andor unique to the company we also believe that shareholders can express concern regarding executive compensation practices through their vote on directors and our preferred approach to managing payforperformance disconnects is via a withhold vote for the compensation committee as a result our say on pay vote is likely to correspond with our vote on the directors who are compensation committee members responsible for making compensation decisions advisory votes on the frequency of say on pay resolutions say when on pay blackrock will generally opt for a triennial vote on say on pay we believe that shareholders should undertake an annual review of executive compensation and express their concerns through their vote on the members of the compensation committee as a result it is not necessary to hold a say on pay vote on an annual basis as the say on pay vote merely supplements the shareholders vote on compensation committee members claw back proposals claw back proposals are generally shareholder sponsored and seek recoupment of bonuses paid to senior executives if those bonuses were based on financial results that are later restated we generally favor recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial reporting regardless of that particular executives role in the faulty reporting we typically support these proposals unless the company already has a robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns employee stock purchase plans an employee stock purchase plan espp gives the issuers employees the opportunity to purchase stock in the issuer typically at a discount to market value we believe these plans can provide performance incentives and help align employees interests with those of shareholders the most common form of espp qualifies for favorable tax treatment     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   under section  of the internal revenue code section  plans must permit all fulltime employees to participate carry restrictions on the maximum number of shares that can be purchased carry an exercise price of at least  percent of fair market value on grant date with offering periods of  months or less and be approved by shareholders we will typically support qualified espp proposals equity compensation plans blackrock supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors managers and other employees with those of shareholders we believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder interests for example use of the stock as collateral for a loan use of the stock in a margin account use of the stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative transactions we may support shareholder proposals requesting the board to establish such policies our evaluation of equity compensation plans in a postexpensing environment is based on a companys executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a payforperformance disconnect we generally oppose plans that contain evergreen provisions allowing for the ongoing increase of shares reserved without shareholder approval we also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval we may also oppose plans that provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur finally we may oppose plans where we believe that the company is aggressively accounting for the equity delivered through their stock plans golden parachutes golden parachutes provide for compensation to management in the event of a change in control we may support shareholder proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval in particular we generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed  times an executives current compensation we generally view golden parachutes as encouragement to management to consider proposals that might be beneficial to shareholders when determining whether to support or oppose an advisory vote on a golden parachute plan say on golden parachutes we normally support the plan unless there is clear evidence of excess or abuse option exchanges blackrock may support a request to exchange underwater options under the following circumstances the company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends not individual company performance directors and executive officers are excluded the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders and there is clear evidence that absent repricing the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   payforperformance plans in order for executive compensation exceeding  million to qualify for federal tax deductions the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra requires companies to link that compensation for the companys top five executives to disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval the law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside directors administer these plans because the primary objective of these proposals is to preserve the deductibility of such compensation we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income payforsuperiorperformance these are typically shareholder proposals requesting that compensation committees adopt policies under which a portion of equity compensation requires the achievement of performance goals as a prerequisite to vesting we generally believe these matters are best left to the compensation committee of the board and that shareholders should not set executive compensation or dictate the terms thereof we may support these proposals if we have a substantial concern regarding the companys compensation practices over a significant period of time the proposals are not overly prescriptive and we believe the proposed approach is likely to lead to substantial improvement supplemental executive retirement plans blackrock may support shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in supplemental executive retirement plans serp agreements to a shareholder vote unless the companys executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employeewide plans social ethical and environmental issues see global corporate governance and engagement principles general corporate governance matters adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes we generally support such proposals when the agenda contains items that we judge to be in shareholders best longterm economic interests bundled proposals we believe that shareholders should have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals where several measures are grouped into one proposal blackrock may reject certain positive changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   confidential voting shareholders most often propose confidential voting as a means of eliminating undue management pressure on shareholders regarding their vote on proxy issues we generally support proposals to allow confidential voting however we will usually support suspension of confidential voting during proxy contests where dissidents have access to vote information and management may face an unfair disadvantage other business we oppose giving companies our proxy to vote on matters where we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight reincorporation proposals to reincorporate from one state or country to another are most frequently motivated by considerations of antitakeover protections or cost savings where cost savings are the sole issue we will typically favor reincorporating in all instances we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charterarticlesbylaws to assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections where we find that shareholder protections are diminished we will support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights shareholders right to act by written consent in exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting we therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to solicit votes by written consent in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders typically a minimum of  are required to initiate the consent solicitation process and support from a minimum of  of outstanding shares is required to effectuate the action by written consent we believe that such thresholds are necessary in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others or recommends thresholds for action that we believe are too low shareholders right to call a special meeting in exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting we therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders typically a minimum of  are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests however we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others     proxy voting guidelines for us securities    table of contents proxy voting guidelines for us securities   simple majority voting we generally favor a simple majority voting requirement to pass proposals therefore we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders ability to protect their economic interests is improved nonetheless in situations where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may therefore support supermajority requirements in those situations   table of contents part c other information   item        exhibits   a    amended and restated certificate and agreement of limited

only for us residents using it means you agree to our terms of use page all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal generally those offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk stock prices fluctuate sometimes rapidly and dramatically due to factors affecting individual companies particular industries or sectors or general market conditions bond prices are affected by interest rate changes bond prices and thus a bond funds share price generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates as the price of bonds in a fund adjusts to a rise in interest rates the funds share price may decline special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors to the extent the fund focuses on particular countries regions industries sectors or types of investment from time to time it may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas of focus than a fund that invests in a wider variety of countries regions industries sectors or investments  smaller midsized and relatively new or unseasoned companies can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger more established companies historically these securities have experienced more price volatility than larger company stocks especially over the shorttermperformance of the funds may vary significantly from the performance of an index as a result of transactions costs expenses and other factors for strategic beta etfs there can be no assurance that a funds multifactor stock selection process will enhance performance exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments perhaps for extended periods  for actively managed etfs there is no guarantee that the managers investment decisions will produce the desired results these and other risks are discussed in the fund’s prospectus for more information on any funds contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus investors should carefully consider a funds investment goals risks sales charges and expenses before investing the prospectus contains this and other information

commissions and etf expenses will reduce returns net asset value nav represents an etf’s persharevalue the nav per share is determined by dividing the total nav of the fund by the number of shares outstanding the fund calculates the nav per share each business day as of  pm pacific time which normally coincides with the close of trading on the new york stock exchange nyse and bats bzx exchange bats the fund does not calculate the nav on days the nyse and bats are closed for trading if the nyse and bats have a scheduled early close or unscheduled early close the fund’s share price would still be determined as of  pm pacific time             etf shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price not their net asset value nav on the exchange on which they are listed
