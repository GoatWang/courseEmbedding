product launches that he thinks investors should pay attention to ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jun   at am in the first half of  chip giant intel nasdaqintc has released many products including its seventhgeneration core processors for notebook and desktop computers as well as its first core xseries processors for the highend desktop personal computer market however compared with what the company has in store for the remainder of the year what weve seen so far looks rather tame image source intel lets consider three intel product launches that im looking forward to and why investors should care about them the big purley launch intels most important growth business is its datacenter group commonly abbreviated dcg while this business has been a nice source of growth for the company for many years it hasnt grown as quickly as the company had hoped over the last several years this year intel expects dcg revenue to grow at a highsingledigit rate though the companys longterm revenue growth here is a lowdoubledigit rate one way intel can try to juice growth is to bring out new and compelling products new products not only give potential customers reasons to upgrade their current hardware infrastructure but with sufficient feature and performance additions as well as sensible product segmentation efforts the company can also try to boost its processor average selling prices sometime this summer intel is expected to launch its nextgeneration server processor platform known as purley with purley intel not only promises to bring faster processors to the table but its also promising a whole slew of new feature additions to the platform intels first revision of the purley platform should be the main driver of the companys dcg revenue over the next year though the company has indicated there are several such revisions in the pipeline itll be interesting to see how this one affects dcgs business performance eighthgeneration core in the second half of this year  probably in the fall  intel is expected to launch its eighthgeneration core processor family for some types of notebook and desktop personal computers intel is expected to launch a product known as kaby lakerefresh for notebook personal computers these chips will include four processor cores and be manufactured in a new nanometer technology potentially providing a significant performance upgrade over the current kaby lake useries notebook chips that have just two processor cores and are manufactured in the companys less powerful nanometer technology intel is also expected to launch its first coffee lake processors for the enthusiast portion of the desktop personal computer market these chips are also expected to be manufactured in the companys nanometer technology and include up to six processor cores up from the four processor cores currently available in the enthusiastoriented kaby lake processors intel has indicated that to keep its personal computer processor average selling prices robust it aims to release new products at an annual clip that offer improved performance features and integration those highcore count core x chips although intel has formally announced its entire core x processor lineup for highend desktop personal computers only the chips with between four and  cores are currently available for preorder intel says a core x processor with  cores will arrive in august while variants with   and  cores will launch in october while the  to core parts are certainly niche products that are likely to sell in rather small quantities they should be rather lucrative for the company furthermore since the products are being released in multiple phases intel gets multiple opportunities to launch products build buzz for the new chips as well as the rest of the chips in the product line and so on ashraf eassa owns shares of intel the motley fool recommends intel the motley fool has a disclosure policy author ashraf eassa tmfchipfool ashraf eassa is a

interface controllers and integrated circuits flash memory graphics chips embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing intel corporation was founded on july   by semiconductor pioneers robert noyce and gordon moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of andrew grove the companys name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics with cofounder noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit microchip the fact that intel is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate intel was an early developer of sram and dram memory chips which represented the majority of its business until  although intel created the worlds first commercial microprocessor chip in  it was not until the success of the personal computer pc that this became its primary business during the s intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry during this period intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for pcs and was known for aggressive and anticompetitive tactics in defense of its market position

market shareedit market share in early edit according to idc while intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide pc microprocessor market  and the mobile pc microprocessor  in the second quarter of  the numbers decreased by  and  compared to the first quarter of  historical market shareedit in the s intel was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors th in  in the world in  intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and has held the position ever since other top semiconductor companies include tsmc advanced micro devices samsung texas instruments toshiba and stmicroelectronics major competitorsedit competitors in pc chip sets include advanced micro devices via technologies silicon integrated systems and nvidia intels competitors in networking include nxp semiconductors infineon broadcom limited marvell technology group and applied micro circuits corporation and competitors in flash memory include spansion samsung qimonda toshiba stmicroelectronics and sk hynix the only major competitor in the x processor market is advanced micro devices amd with which intel has had full crosslicensing agreements since  each partner can use the others patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time however the crosslicensing agreement is canceled in the event of an amd bankruptcy or takeover some smaller competitors such as via technologies produce lowpower x processors for small factor computers and portable equipment however the advent of such mobile computing devices in particular smartphones has in recent years led to a decline in pc sales since over  of the worlds smartphones currently use processors designed by arm holdings arm has become a major competitor for intels processor market arm is also planning to make inroads into the pc and server market intel has been involved in several disputes regarding violation of antitrust laws which are noted below corporate historyedit further information timeline of intel originsedit andy grove robert noyce and gordon moore in  intel corporations former logo used from  to  intel was founded in mountain view california in  by gordon e moore of moores law fame a chemist and robert noyce a physicist and coinventor of the integrated circuit arthur rock investor and venture capitalist helped them find investors while max palevsky was on the board from an early stage moore and noyce had left fairchild semiconductor to found intel rock was not an employee but he was an investor and was chairman of the board the total initial investment in intel was  million convertible debentures and  from rock just  years later intel became a public company via an initial public offering ipo raising  million  per share intels third employee was andy grove a chemical engineer who later ran the company through much of the s and the highgrowth s in deciding on a name moore and noyce quickly rejected moore noyce homophone for more noise – an illsuited name for an electronics company since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference instead they founded the company as n m electronics on july   but by the end of the month had changed the name to intel which stood for integrated electronics since intel was already trademarked by the hotel chain intelco they had to buy the rights for the name early historyedit at its founding intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors its first product in  was the  schottky ttl bipolar bit static randomaccess memory sram which was nearly twice as fast as earlier schottky diode implementations by fairchild and the electrotechnical laboratory in tsukuba japan in the same year intel also produced the  schottky bipolar bit readonly memory rom and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor fieldeffect transistor mosfet silicon gate sram chip the bit  intels business grew during the s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products still dominated by various memory devices federico faggin the designer of intel  while intel created the first commercially available microprocessor intel  in  and one of the first microcomputers in  by the early s its business was dominated by dynamic randomaccess memory chips however increased competition from japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by  dramatically reduced the profitability of this market the growing success of the ibm personal computer based on an intel microprocessor was among factors that convinced gordon moore ceo since  to shift the companys focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model moores decision to solesource intels  chip played into the companys continuing success the development of the microprocessor by intel  the microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry a microprocessor miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer by the end of the s buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibms competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market intel embarked on a year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry part of the winning wintel combination moore handed over to andy grove in  by launching its intel inside marketing campaign in  intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the s its line of pentium processors had become a household name slowing demand and challenges to dominance in edit after  growth in demand for highend microprocessors slowed competitors notably amd intels largest competitor in its primary x architecture market garnered significant market share initially in lowend and midrange processors but ultimately across the product range and intels dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced in the early s thenceo craig barrett attempted to diversify the companys business beyond semiconductors but few of these activities were ultimately successful litigationedit intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of  a law sought by intel and the semiconductor industry association sia during the late s and s after this law was passed intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the  cpu the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if intel lost the suits antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against intel in  in  and  amd brought further claims against intel related to unfair competition regaining of momentum –edit in  ceo paul otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms enterprise digital home digital health and mobility in  intel unveiled its core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field in  intel had another tick when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was  nm later that year intel released a processor with the nehalem architecture nehalem had positive reviews sale of xscale processor business edit on june   the sale of intels xscale assets was announced intel agreed to sell the xscale processor business to marvell technology group for an estimated  million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities the move was intended to permit intel to focus its resources on its core x and server businesses and the acquisition completed on november   acquisitions

to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in  intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using nm process general manager of intels custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future this was after poor sales of windows  hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except for qualcomm which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer apple as of july  five companies were using intels fabs via the intel custom foundry division achronix tabula netronome

several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time the alliance for affordable internet aai was launched in october  and intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes facebook google and microsoft led by sir tim bernerslee the aai seeks to make internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world where only  of people are online google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the un broadband commissions worldwide target of  of monthly income product and market historyedit srams and the microprocessoredit intels first products were shift register memory and randomaccess memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dram sram and rom markets throughout the s concurrently intel engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intels first microprocessor originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the intel  was introduced to the mass market on november   though the microprocessor did not become the core of intels business until the mids note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor from dram to microprocessorsedit in  at the dawn of the personal computer era intels profits came under increased pressure from japanese memorychip manufacturers and thenpresident andy grove focused the company on microprocessors grove described this transition in the book only the paranoid survive a key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular  microprocessor until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplierclarification needed but grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factorieswhich and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as zilog and amdcitation needed when the pc industry boomed in the late s and s intel was one of the primary beneficiaries intel x processors and the ibm pcedit the die from an intel  an bit microcontroller that includes a cpu running at  mhz  bytes of ram  bytes of eprom and io in the same chip despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the  and its successors the  and the  were never major revenue contributors at intel as the next processor the  and its variant the  was completed in  intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed operation crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible one design win was the newly created ibm pc division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time ibm introduced its personal computer in  and it was rapidly successful in  intel created the  microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pcat compaq the first ibm pc clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster  processor in  and in  quickly followed with the first based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pccompatible systems and setting up intel as a key component supplier in  the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced bit microprocessor finally released in  as the intel iapx  the project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace intel extended the x architecture to  bits instead  microprocessoredit during this period andrew grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its dram business and directing resources to the microprocessor business of perhaps greater importance was his decision to singlesource the  microprocessor prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers to mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply the  and series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd with which intel had a technologysharing contract grove made the decision not to license the  design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories santa clara california hillsboro oregon and chandler a suburb of phoenix arizona he convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery in doing this intel breached its contract with amd which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new intel cpu designs any longer instead amd started to develop and manufacture its own competing x designs as the success of compaqs deskpro  established the  as the dominant cpu choice intel achieved a position of nearexclusive dominance as its supplier profits from this funded rapid development of both higherperformance chip designs and higherperformance manufacturing capabilities propelling intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early s  pentium and itaniumedit intel introduced the  microprocessor in  and in  established a second design team designing the processors codenamed p and p in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the  chip and later intels signature pentium chip the p project was earlier known as operation bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines the p was introduced in  as the intel pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as  cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the united states the p followed in  as the pentium pro and improved into the pentium ii in  new architectures were developed alternately in santa clara california and hillsboro oregon the santa clara design team embarked in  on a successor to the x architecture codenamed p the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlettpackard engineers though intel soon took over primary design responsibility the resulting implementation of the ia bit architecture was the itanium finally introduced in june  the itaniums performance running legacy x code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x which was amds bit extension of the bit x architecture intel uses the name intel  previously emt as of  intel continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into  the hillsboro team designed the willamette processors initially codenamed p which were marketed as the pentium citation needed pentium flawedit main article pentium fdiv bug in june  intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floatingpoint math subsection of the p pentium microprocessor under certain datadependent conditions the loworder bits of the result of a floatingpoint division would be incorrect the error could compound in subsequent calculations intel corrected the error in a future chip revision and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective pentium cpus which were limited to some     and  mhz models on customer request the bug was discovered independently in october  by thomas nicely professor of mathematics at lynchburg college he contacted intel but received no response on october  he posted a message about his finding on the internet word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press the bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system consequently many users did not accept intels statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum during thanksgiving in  the new york times ran a piece by journalist john markoff spotlighting the error intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large enduser support organization this resulted in a  million charge against intels  revenue dr nicely later learned that intel had discovered the fdiv bug in its own testing a few months before him but had decided not to inform customers the pentium flaw incident intels response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name dovetailing with an uptick in the intel inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more enduser focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression intel inside and other campaignsedit the iconic former intel inside logo used from  to  during this period intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns the first campaign the  intel inside marketing and branding campaign is widely known and has become synonymous with intel itself the idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so this campaign established intel which had been a component supplier littleknown outside the pc industry as a household name the second campaign intels systems group which began in the early s showcased manufacturing of pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged the systems group campaign was lesser known than the intel inside campaign shortly after intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang upcitation needed at its peak in the mids intel manufactured over  of all pcs making it the thirdlargest supplier at the timecitation needed during the s intel architecture labs ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer including the pci bus the pci express pcie bus the universal serial bus usb ials software efforts met with a more mixed fate its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital videocitation needed but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from microsoft the competition between intel and microsoft was revealed in testimony by ial vicepresident steven mcgeady at the microsoft antitrust trial united states v microsoft corp solidstate drives ssdedit an intel xm ssd intel p nvme flash ssd pcie addin card on september   intel began shipping its first mainstream solidstate drives the xm and xm with  gb and  gb storage capacities reviews measured high performance with these mlcbased drives intel released its slcbased enterprise xe extreme ssds on october  that same year in capacities of gb and gb in july  intel moved its xm and xm lines from a nanometer to a nanometer process these new drives dubbed by the press as the xm and xm g or generation  reduced prices by up to  percent while offering lower latency and improved performance on february   intel and micron announced that they were gearing up for production of nand flash memory using a new nanometer process in march of that same year intel entered the budget ssd segment with its xv drives with an initial capacity of  gb the ssd  intels first msata drive was released in december  providing xm g performance in a much smaller package march  saw the introduction of two new ssd lines from intel the first the ssd  used an sata  gigabit per

not lower the price of its chips advertising and brand managementedit intel insideedit intel has become one of the worlds most recognizable computer brands following its longrunning intel inside campaign the idea for intel inside came out of a meeting between intel and one of the major computer resellers microage in the late s intels market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as advanced micro devices now amd zilog and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers this was because by using cheaper processors manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly pricesensitive market in  intels dennis carter visited microages headquarters in tempe arizona to meet with microages vp of marketing ron mion microage had become one of the largest distributors of compaq ibm hp and others and thus was a primary – although indirect – driver of demand for microprocessors intel wanted microage to petition its computer suppliers to favor intel chips however mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted intels counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate pc buyers on why intel microprocessors were worth paying more for  and they were right but mion felt that the public didnt really need to fully understand why intel chips were better they just needed to feel they were better so mion proposed a market test intel would pay for a microage billboard somewhere saying if youre buying a personal computer make sure it has intel inside in turn microage would put intel inside stickers on the intelbased computers in their stores in that area to make the test easier to monitor mion decided to do the test in boulder colorado where it had a single store virtually overnight the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to intelbased pcs intel very quickly adopted intel inside as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide as is often the case with computer lore other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved intel inside has not escaped that tendency and there are other explanations that had been floating around intels branding campaign started with the computer inside tagline in  in the us and europe the japan chapter of intel proposed an intel in it tagline and kicked off the japanese campaign by hosting ekikon meaning station concert in japanese at the tokyo railway station dome on christmas day december   several months later the computer inside incorporated the japan idea to become intel inside which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in  by intel marketing manager dennis carter the case study of the inside intel inside was put together by harvard business school the fivenote jingle was introduced in  and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in  countries around the world the initial branding agency for the intel

beyond centrino to include the viiv media center pc and the business desktop intel vpro in midjanuary  intel announced that they were dropping the long running pentium name from their processors the pentium name was first used to refer to the p core intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior  and  processors both of which had copies manufactured by ibm and amd they phased out the pentium names from mobile processors first when the new yonah chips branded core solo and core duo were released the desktop processors changed when the core  line of processors were released by  intel was using a goodbetterbest strategy with celeron being good pentium better and the intel core family representing the best the company has to offer according to spokesman bill calder intel has maintained only the celeron brand the atom brand

name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics with cofounder noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit microchip the fact that intel is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate intel was an early developer of sram and dram memory chips which represented the majority of its business until  although intel created the worlds first commercial microprocessor chip in  it was not until the success of the personal computer pc that this became its primary business during the s intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry during this period intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for pcs and was known for aggressive and anticompetitive tactics in defense of its market position particularly against advanced micro devices amd as well as a struggle with microsoft for control over the direction of the pc industry the open source technology center

include nxp semiconductors infineon broadcom limited marvell technology group and applied micro circuits corporation and competitors in flash memory include spansion samsung qimonda toshiba stmicroelectronics and sk hynix the only major competitor in the x processor market is advanced micro devices amd with which intel has had full crosslicensing agreements since  each partner can use the others patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time however the crosslicensing agreement is canceled in the event of an amd bankruptcy or takeover some smaller competitors such as via technologies produce lowpower x processors for small factor computers and portable equipment however the advent of such mobile computing devices in particular smartphones has in recent years led to a decline in pc sales since over  of the worlds smartphones currently use processors designed by arm holdings arm has become a major competitor for intels processor market arm is also planning to make inroads into the pc and server market intel has been involved in several disputes regarding violation of antitrust laws which are noted below corporate historyedit further information timeline of intel originsedit andy grove robert noyce and gordon moore in  intel corporations former logo used from  to  intel was founded in mountain view california in  by gordon e moore of moores law fame a chemist and robert noyce a physicist and coinventor of the integrated circuit arthur rock investor and venture capitalist helped them find investors while max palevsky was on the board from an early stage moore and noyce had left fairchild semiconductor to found intel rock was not an employee but he was an investor and was chairman of the board the total initial investment in intel was  million convertible debentures and  from rock just  years later intel became a public company via an initial public offering ipo raising  million  per share intels third employee was andy grove a chemical engineer who later ran the company through much of the s and the highgrowth s in deciding on a name moore and noyce quickly rejected moore noyce homophone for more noise – an illsuited name for an electronics company since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference instead they founded the company as n m electronics on july   but by the end of the month had changed the name to intel which stood for integrated electronics since intel was already trademarked by the hotel chain intelco they had to buy the rights for the name early historyedit at its founding intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors its first product in  was the  schottky ttl bipolar bit static randomaccess memory sram which was nearly twice as fast as earlier schottky diode implementations by fairchild and the electrotechnical laboratory in tsukuba japan in the same year intel also produced the  schottky bipolar bit readonly memory rom and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor fieldeffect transistor mosfet silicon gate sram chip the bit  intels business grew during the s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products still dominated by various memory devices federico faggin the designer of intel  while intel created the first commercially available microprocessor intel  in  and one of the first microcomputers in  by the early s its business was dominated by dynamic randomaccess memory chips however increased competition from japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by  dramatically reduced the profitability of this market the growing success of the ibm personal computer based on an intel microprocessor was among factors that convinced gordon moore ceo since  to shift the companys focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model moores decision to solesource intels  chip played into the companys continuing success the development of the microprocessor by intel  the microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry a microprocessor miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a mini computer and then known as a personal computer by the end of the s buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibms competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market intel embarked on a year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry part of the winning wintel combination moore handed over to andy grove in  by launching its intel inside marketing campaign in  intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the s its line of pentium processors had become a household name slowing demand and challenges to dominance in edit after  growth in demand for highend microprocessors slowed competitors notably amd intels largest competitor in its primary x architecture market garnered significant market share initially in lowend and midrange processors but ultimately across the product range and intels dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced in the early s thenceo craig barrett attempted to diversify the companys business beyond semiconductors but few of these activities were ultimately successful litigationedit intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of  a law sought by intel and the semiconductor industry association sia during the late s and s after this law was passed intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the  cpu the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if intel lost the suits antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against intel in  in  and  amd brought further claims against intel related to unfair competition regaining of momentum –edit in  ceo paul otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms enterprise digital home digital health and mobility in  intel unveiled its core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field in  intel had another tick when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was  nm later that year intel released a processor with the nehalem architecture nehalem had positive reviews sale of xscale processor business edit on june   the sale of intels xscale assets was announced intel agreed to sell the xscale processor business to marvell technology group for an estimated  million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities the move was intended to permit intel to focus its resources on its core x and server businesses and the acquisition completed on november   acquisitions

to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in  intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using nm process general manager of intels custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future this was after poor sales of windows  hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except

only  of people are online google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the un broadband commissions worldwide target of  of monthly income product and market historyedit srams and the microprocessoredit intels first products were shift register memory and randomaccess memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dram sram and rom markets throughout the s concurrently intel engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intels first microprocessor originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the intel  was introduced to the mass market on november   though the microprocessor did not become the core of intels business until the mids note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor from dram to microprocessorsedit in  at the dawn of the personal computer era intels profits came under increased pressure from japanese memorychip manufacturers and thenpresident andy grove focused the company on microprocessors grove described this transition in the book only the paranoid survive a key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular  microprocessor until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplierclarification needed but grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factorieswhich and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as zilog and amdcitation needed when the pc industry boomed in the late s and s intel was one of the primary beneficiaries intel x processors and the ibm pcedit the die from an intel  an bit microcontroller that includes a cpu running at  mhz  bytes of ram  bytes of eprom and io in the same chip despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the  and its successors the  and the  were never major revenue contributors at intel as the next processor the  and its variant the  was completed in  intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed operation crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible one design win was the newly created ibm pc division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time ibm introduced its personal computer in  and it was rapidly successful in  intel created the  microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pcat compaq the first ibm pc clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster  processor in  and in  quickly followed with the first based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pccompatible systems and setting up intel as a key component supplier in  the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced bit microprocessor finally released in  as the intel iapx  the project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace intel extended the x architecture to  bits instead  microprocessoredit during this period andrew grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its dram business and directing resources to the microprocessor business of perhaps greater importance was his decision to singlesource the  microprocessor prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers to mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply the  and series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd with which intel had a technologysharing contract grove made the decision not to license the  design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories santa clara california hillsboro oregon and chandler a suburb of phoenix arizona he convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery in doing this intel breached its contract with amd which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new intel cpu designs any longer instead amd started to develop and manufacture its own competing x designs as the success of compaqs deskpro  established the  as the dominant cpu choice intel achieved a position of nearexclusive dominance as its supplier profits from this funded rapid development of both higherperformance chip designs and higherperformance manufacturing capabilities propelling intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early s  pentium and itaniumedit intel introduced the  microprocessor in  and in  established a second design team designing the processors codenamed p and p in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the  chip and later intels signature pentium chip the p project was earlier known as operation bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines the p was introduced in  as the intel pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as  cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the united states the p followed in  as the pentium pro and improved into the pentium ii in  new architectures were developed alternately in santa clara california and hillsboro oregon the santa clara design team embarked in  on a successor to the x architecture codenamed p the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlettpackard engineers though intel soon took over primary design responsibility the resulting implementation of the ia bit architecture was the itanium finally introduced in june  the itaniums performance running legacy x code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x which was amds bit extension of the bit x architecture intel uses the name intel  previously emt as of  intel continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into  the hillsboro team designed the willamette processors initially codenamed p which were marketed as the pentium citation needed pentium flawedit main article pentium fdiv bug in june  intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floatingpoint math subsection of the p pentium microprocessor under certain datadependent conditions the loworder bits of the result of a floatingpoint division would be incorrect the error could compound in subsequent calculations intel corrected the error in a future chip revision and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective pentium cpus which were limited to some     and  mhz models on customer request the bug was discovered independently in october  by thomas nicely professor of mathematics at lynchburg college he contacted intel but received no response on october  he posted a message about his finding on the internet word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press the bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system consequently many users did not accept intels statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum during thanksgiving in  the new york times ran a piece by journalist john markoff spotlighting the error intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large enduser support organization this resulted in a  million charge against intels  revenue dr nicely later learned that intel had discovered the fdiv bug in its own testing a few months before him but had decided not to inform customers the pentium flaw incident intels response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name dovetailing with an uptick in the intel inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more enduser focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression intel inside and other campaignsedit the iconic former intel inside logo used from  to  during this period intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns the first campaign the  intel inside marketing and branding campaign is widely known and has become synonymous with intel itself the idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so this campaign established intel which had been a component supplier littleknown outside the pc industry as a household name the second campaign intels systems group which began in the early s showcased manufacturing of pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged the systems group campaign was lesser known than the intel inside campaign shortly after intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang upcitation needed at its peak in the mids intel manufactured over  of all pcs making it the thirdlargest supplier at the timecitation needed during the s intel architecture labs ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer including the pci bus the pci express pcie bus the universal serial bus usb ials software efforts met with a more mixed fate its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital videocitation needed but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from microsoft the competition between intel and microsoft was revealed in testimony by ial vicepresident steven mcgeady at the microsoft antitrust trial united states v microsoft corp solidstate drives ssdedit an intel xm ssd intel p nvme flash ssd pcie addin card on september   intel began shipping its first mainstream solidstate drives the xm and xm with  gb and  gb storage capacities reviews measured high performance with these mlcbased drives intel released its slcbased enterprise xe extreme ssds on october  that same year in capacities of gb and gb in july  intel moved its xm and xm lines from a nanometer to a nanometer process these new drives dubbed by the press as the xm and xm g or generation  reduced prices by up to  percent while offering lower latency and improved performance on february   intel and micron announced that they were gearing up for production of nand flash memory using a new nanometer process in march of that same year intel entered the budget ssd segment with its xv drives with an initial capacity of  gb the ssd  intels first

not lower the price of its chips advertising and brand managementedit intel insideedit intel has become one of the worlds most recognizable computer brands following its longrunning intel inside campaign the idea for intel inside came out of a meeting between intel and one of the major computer resellers microage in the late s intels market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as advanced micro devices now amd zilog and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers this was because by using cheaper processors manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly pricesensitive market in  intels dennis carter visited microages headquarters in tempe arizona to meet with microages vp of marketing ron mion microage had become one of the largest distributors of compaq ibm hp and others and thus was a primary – although indirect – driver of demand for microprocessors intel wanted microage to petition its computer suppliers to favor intel chips however mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted intels counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate pc buyers on why intel microprocessors were worth paying more for  and they were right but mion felt that the public didnt really need to fully understand why intel chips were better they just needed to feel they were better so mion proposed a market test intel would pay for a microage billboard somewhere saying if youre buying a personal computer make sure it has intel inside in turn microage would put intel inside stickers on the intelbased computers in their stores in that area to make the test easier to monitor mion decided to do the test in boulder colorado where it had a single store virtually overnight the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to intelbased pcs intel very quickly adopted intel inside as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide as is often the case with computer lore other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved intel inside has not escaped that tendency and there are other explanations that had been floating around intels branding campaign started with the computer inside tagline in  in the us and europe the japan chapter of intel proposed an intel in it tagline and kicked off the japanese campaign by hosting ekikon meaning station concert in japanese at the tokyo railway station dome on christmas day december   several months later the computer inside incorporated the japan idea to become intel inside which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in  by intel marketing manager dennis carter the case study of the inside intel inside was put together by harvard business school the fivenote jingle was introduced in  and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in  countries around the world the initial branding agency for the intel inside campaign was dahlinsmithwhite advertising of salt lake city the intel swirl logo was the work of dahlinsmithwhite art director steve grigg under the direction of intel president and ceo andy

beyond centrino to include the viiv media center pc and the business desktop intel vpro in midjanuary  intel announced that they were dropping the long running pentium name from their processors the pentium name was first used to refer to the p core intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior  and  processors both of which had copies manufactured by ibm and amd they phased out the pentium names from mobile processors first when the new yonah chips branded core solo and core duo were released the desktop processors changed when the core  line of processors were released by  intel was using a goodbetterbest strategy with celeron being good pentium better and the intel core family representing the best the company has to offer according to spokesman bill calder intel has maintained only the celeron brand the atom brand
