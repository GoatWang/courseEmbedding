the previous eur million bfe notes due  issued in june  the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge ltd bunge bunge intends to use net proceeds from the issuance for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding indebtedness such as borrowings under bunges revolving credit facilities the rating outlook is stable a full list of ratings follows at the end of this release key rating drivers agribusiness segment concentration bunge has a leading position in oilseed processing and logistics that supports the approximate  billion in consolidated annual revenues bunge has considerable geographical diversification with its global asset footprint covering all major export and import markets although it has substantial exposure to south america including approximately  of its total processing capacity while there is some diversification of the business portfolio provided by the food and ingredients businesses the agribusiness segment currently represents more than  of operating income in an effort to offset earnings concentration and help reduce volatility over the longer term bunge targets increasing the value added contribution of the food and ingredients businesses edible oil and milling products to approximately  of total operating income through a combination of organic growth and asset purchases this compares to  in  fitch views bunges business risk profile as weaker relative to its peers cargill or adm due to smaller operational scale and less geographic and commodity diversification bunge also has experienced challenges with driving sustained growth in operational earnings as ebitda has vacillated in the  billion to  billion range during the past six years when combined with moderately higher average leverage these factors result in a three notch ratings differential between bunge and its peers adm and cargill earnings pressure expected to reverse in  in the first nine months of  ebit in the agribusiness segment declined to  million from  million driven primarily by lower gross profit from grain origination and oilseed processing in south america weaker soy and canola oilseeds processing in north america and weaker softseeds processing in europe south america weakness has been negatively affected by adverse weather and weakening of the us dollar against key grain growing region currencies consequently south american farmers have been unwilling to sell grains thus creating limited merchandising and crushing opportunities that will likely extend into  brazilian farmers have also chosen to defer a higher portion of sales for next years production that typically occurs in the third quarter of  in hope of higher commodity prices based on the current trajectory the remaining food  ingredients fertilizer and sugar  bioenergy segments are expected to partially offset the weakness in the agribusiness segment and contribute in aggregate at least  million in ebit in  versus  million in  as such fitch expects bunges overall operating income will decline in the lowdouble digit range in  and that ebitda will be around  billion at the lower end of average ebitda over the last four years however several factors support an improved earnings outlook in  that is underpinned by a favorable longterm outlook for the agriculture industry given higher consumption of protein in developing countries and increasing demand for biofuels the earnings recovery reflects the expectations that south american farmers will need to commercialize their crops leading to increased capacity utilization particularly in crush a return to normal pricing patterns in south america meal demand returns to more normalized levels benefits flow through from cost initiatives and contributions rampup from bolton acquisitions the food  ingredients fertilizer and sugar  bioenergy segments are also expected to realize in aggregate doubledigit ebit growth the outlook assumes a commodity price environment should remain low in  absent weather dislocations in the southern and northern hemisphere processors and ingredient users are thus expected to experience improved margins while farm level margins will remain challenged exposure to commodity volatility bunge along with other agricultural processors are subject to variations with commodity pricing that can be affected by a range of unpredictable macro environmental conditions that include weather crop disease outbreaks and government agricultural policy changes thus bunge can be exposed to periods of volatile agricultural commodity pricing swings stemming from periodic supplydemand imbalances timing of cash payments or foreign exchange movements that can negatively affect us exports consequently operating earnings can be pressured andor debt can increase which can quickly increase leverage during the past several years global grain supplies have been replenished from large harvests of key crops limiting volatility and resulting in lower prices rmi supports ratings agricultural commodity trading and processing companies maintain substantial grain and oilseed inventories that are hedged and could readily be converted into cash to enhance their liquidity and reduce debt this high level of liquid readily marketable inventories rmi when combined with cash and shortterm marketable securities provides substantial financial flexibility during periods of earnings volatility associated with agricultural cycles partially mitigating financial risk commercial paper accounts receivable securitizations and bank credit facilities are generally used to finance seasonal working capital needs primarily related to rmi for credit purposes fitch calculates rmi adjusted leverage by first subtracting the minimum or base level inventory required to operate a downstream processing facility this inventory is not generally readily available for liquidation purposes with a going concern entity an additional  discount is taken for the remaining merchandisable inventory reported rmi less minimum base processing inventory to account for potential basis risk loss on their hedging positions leverage expected to moderate rmi adjusted leverage total debt with equity credit less rmi  ebitda less rmi interest increased modestly to x and gross leverage increased to x for the latestmonth ltm period as of sept   from x and x respectively in  this was primarily driven by working capital usage due to increases with rmi and softer ltm ebitda bunges reported rmi increased during the first three quarters of  by approximately  million to  billion fitch expects debt levels to further decline from the peak at the end of the first half in  as rmi levels normalize partially offset by ebitda pressure resulting in rmi adjusted leverage in the upper x range for  fitch expects rmi leverage should decline modestly to less than x given the recovery in ebitda and stable debt levels key assumptions key assumptions within fitchs rating case in  for bunge include ebitda declining from  levels to around  billion capital spending to remain below historical levels at approximately  million free cash flow fcf modestly negative due to increased working capital requirements modest acquisition activity focused on bolton purchases rmi adjusted leverage in the upper x range and gross debt leverage in the xx range in  fitchs assumptions include ebitda recovering to around the  billion range capital spending of approximately  million rmi adjusted leverage of less than x and gross debt leverage of less than x fitchs assumption also includes that commodity prices remain relatively stable over the forecast period rating sensitivities future developments that may individually or collectively lead to a negative rating action rmi adjusted leverage sustained above x range driven by ebitda compression andor a meaningfully higher debt levels most likely from changing macro environmental conditions or increase in working capital gross leverage sustained above x a material increase in leverage from a significant debt financed acquisition with lack of meaningful deleverage that returns rmi adjusted leverage to below x  months post transaction change in financial policy lack of fcf generation lasting over two years given the inherent earnings volatility within the business the significant periodic supplydemand imbalances and where bunge is expected to manage its capital structure fitch views a positive rating action as unlikely over the intermediate term future developments that could individually or collectively lead to a positive rating action include materially improved diversification and profitability of the corporate portfolio with increased contribution from the valueadded food and ingredients businesses such that bunge can achieve ebitda growth over a multiyear period and exhibit more stability over the commodity pricing cycle a commitment to operate rmi adjusted leverage consistently below x coupled with improved consistency with fcf generation liquidity bunges internal sources of liquidity include  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities and shortterm investments as of the third quarter  fcf can fluctuate from positive to negative from year to year due to numerous factors for  fitch expects fcf could remain modestly negative a key credit concern of commodity processors is access to sufficient liquidity given historically volatile working capital needs bunge has abundant sources of external liquidity provided by various credit facilities available to fund its operations globally with approximately  billion in capacity under its revolving bank agreements and commercial paper program of which  billion was available at the end of the third quarter of  in addition to the committed credit facilities bunge through its financing subsidiaries will from timetotime enter into bilateral shortterm credit lines as necessary as of sept   there were no borrowings outstanding the bank commitments at bunge limited finance corp blfc are comprised of unsecured bilateral threeyear agreements of  million maturing in june  and  million maturing september  with no borrowings outstanding a  million fiveyear cobank revolving credit agreement maturing may   with no borrowing outstandings and a fiveyear syndicated unsecured revolver totalling  billion maturing in november  with no borrowings outstanding in addition bunge has a threeyear  billion revolving credit facility established by bunge finance europe bv bfe with  million in borrowings outstanding the revolver which can be expanded by  million matures in august  and can be extended by two oneyear periods a  million liquidity facility at bunge asset funding corp bafc backstops a  million commercial paper program that had no borrowings outstanding bunge also participates in a receivables securitization program that provides funding up to  million bunge subsidiaries sell receivables to a bankruptcy remote entity bunge securitization bv that subsequently sells the receivables receivables sold under the program and derecognized on the balance
