needs better marketing better product to win election by laura matthews lauramatt on  at  am former gov tim pawlenty of minnesota photo reutersbryan snyder republican tim pawlenty who served as the th governor of minnesota said his party lost the  election because it needed better marketing and a better product not because president barack obama handed out “gifts” to minoritiesin an interview with cspan’s “newsmakers” program which is scheduled to air  am sunday pawlenty disagreed with republican candidate mitt romney who told his big donors in a conference call last week that his election loss resulted from obama being “very generous” to the africanamericans latinos and young voters who make up his core constituencies“i do think if you look back at the election of  when you have a product that you put into the market place – republican perspective – and the market place doesn’t buy it you either have to have better marketing or a better product” pawlenty said “and so this is a wake up call for the republican party to first of all have better marketing and that involves a lot of things“clearly as the discussion unfolds republicans need to do better with female voters blue collar voters latino and hispanic voters” he added “so there’s a need to better market but we also need to have products that sell better and that doesn’t mean you change your philosophy but i think president obama first of all just tactically did a better job getting out the vote in his campaign no  he at least at the margins was better able to connect with people in this campaign and then they made that judgment but i don’t think it’s a matter of people looking at the election and say ‘i’m going to vote because of gifts’ i think they looked at it and said which one these candidates would they prefer because leadership considerations and also who can also understand their needs the best”this is a very different assessment of the election loss from the one romney gave during the conference callromney told the wealthy donors “with regards to the young people for instance a forgiveness of collegeloan interest was a big gift free contraceptives were very big with young collegeaged women and then finally obamacare also made a difference for them because as you know anybody now  years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents plan and that was a big gift to young people”several republican governors have already started distancing themselves from romney saying those views were not shared by the party louisiana gov bobby jindal called romney’s gifts claims “absolutely wrong” he also said it was time the republican party focuses on getting  percent of the votes and stop dividing the american voterspawlenty who is now the president and ceo the washington dcbased advocacy group financial services roundtable said there’s a lot more to obama’s winning the reelection and that it isn’t as simple as saying he gave out giftsobama’s margin among africanamericans voters was  percent among latinos it was  percent and  percent among young voters between ages  to  most read the newsletterexclusive articles delivered to your inbox

unilateral spending cuts to a million special dietary program that he had unalloted attorney david lillehaug said initially this is i dont think its understating this to say this is one of the most important court cases in minnesota legal history pawlenty announced the following day that he would appeal he filed his defense in february and arguments were heard on march  in may the supreme court affirmed judge gearin deciding that because the legislative and executive branches never enacted a balanced budget for the – biennium use of the unallotment power to address the unresolved deficit exceeded the authority granted to the executive branch by the statute pawlenty responded i will fight to reduce spending and taxes in minnesota and that battle continues my commitment to the people of minnesota remains the same we will balance the budget without raising taxes after the court ruling as the  legislative session drew to a close pawlenty vetoed a budget which would fix a billion deficit by adding a new tax bracket for sixfigure incomes in response to the proposal he criticized democrats for attempting to raise taxes in the midst of an extremely difficult economic situation

over profitsharing of their casinos legislators also pushed a proposal to turn canterbury park horse track into a racino the plan was poorly received by northern tribes who would operate part of the

county sales tax which passed the state legislature and was symbolically signed in at the hubert h humphrey metrodome the majority of hennepin county commissioners did not feel a referendum was necessary to approve the sales tax because of the delay it would cause pawlenty and the legislature agreed citing  years already of the projects debate and exempted the county from state law requiring one in the bill in june  pawlenty signed a million public works bill that included funding for additional work on the northstar commuter rail line a change in position from reservations about the idea

concerns by the education review boards including the amount of content ageappropriateness and a europeancentric view of the social sciences portion yecke revised and expanded material based on the response even as both legislative houses passed the academic standards bill her confirmation as commissioner was rejected by the dfl majority minnesota senate she was seen as an outsider coming from virginia and became unpopular for having pushed the academic reforms during a tight budget session as well as her critical look of minnesota schools in her confirmation hearing dflers also noted concern over her conservative viewpoints in june  pawlenty proposed the achieve program for the top  of high school graduates the program would pay for tuition for the first  years  years for selected fields such as science technology engineering and math and would cost the state an estimated  million per year cycle however the program was not included in the  higher education bill pawlenty used an accounting change called a tax shift to balance the state deficit without raising taxes school districts statewide may unexpectedly lose  million in interest and reserve revenue in  pawlenty vetoed a bill hf  which the legislature had passed  to  calling for minnesota state colleges  universities mnscu to revamp its credit transferring system within five years to fix minimal loss of credits for

t rybak secretary of transportation mary peters behind ellison betty mccollum and senator norm coleman during pawlentys first term urban traffic congestion was a significant concern of voters he appointed his lieutenant governor carol molnau as transportation commissioner for which she was approved by the legislature in may  molnau attempted to reform the transportation department mndot using concepts such as designbuild legislators criticized molnaus performance as transportation commissioner citing ineffective leadership and management and removed her from that role in february  a decision pawlenty said was motivated by partisanship pawlenty favored raising fees and imposing toll lanes on roads as the primary means of discouraging excessive traffic during his term the carpool lanes of interstate  leading into downtown minneapolis were converted into highoccupancy toll lanes pawlenty used or threatened vetoes in   and  on legislation funding proposed highway expansion

and bridge repairs in the wake of the collapse of the iw mississippi river bridge pawlenty had opposed the northstar commuter rail as a legislator but changed his position in  announcing a funding plan to jumpstart the project when the bush administration determined the rail line was deemed costeffective and timesaving for commuters in april  during the budget bonding bill signing pawlenty used his lineitem veto on  million pledged toward the building of the central corridor lightrail project intended to connect minneapolis and saint paul in vetoing the expenditure pawlenty did not consult peter bell head of the metro council and project leader pawlenty stated that he vetoed the bill in order to send a message to the legislature which had exceeded his initial budget request that they needed to stay focused be fiscally disciplined set priorities and solve this budget crisis in a fiscally disciplined way pawlenty however was supportive of the project and had requested the money in the bonding bill he submitted to the minnesota state legislature the veto disappointed some of minnesotas congressional representatives in washington including minnesotas republican senator norm coleman who pledged to raise my voice as strong as i can as loud as i can the federal commitment is there though pawlentys veto might have delayed the ability of the state to receive federal matching funds for the project bell said the project was not derailed the central corridor funding issue was resolved on may   with the state pledging its original amount towards the project after legislators compromised with pawlentys budget requests there were republican state legislators who supported other cuts of the bonding bill including doug magnus the ranking republican on the house transportation finance division who praised pawlentys fiscal responsibility critics including chris coleman mayor of saint paul called pawlentys veto political gamesmanship seeing the move as retribution for the

offenders in response to his first proposal in  the state legislature passed a large package of sentencing reforms one new instrument was the possibility of a life sentence without parole for serious offenders although pawlenty expressed disapproval at the courts reluctance to use this option only seven individuals received such a sentence in the first two years of implementation pawlenty made a push for even harsher sentences in  which increased the presumptive sentence for firstdegree sex offenses from  years to  years and increased it further for repeat offenders at the same time he advocated for a million expansion of the states civil commitment program for sexual offenders maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment programs cost under control according to a single report in the star tribune a report on minnesotas sexoffender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governors skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders early in  after issuing a study that estimated the cost of illegal immigration to the state as approximately  million pawlenty announced a program for changing the way the state dealt with persons who were in the united states illegally pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify the illegal behavior pawlentys extensive proposal included the designation of  state law enforcement officials

develop a marketbased and multisector capandtrade mechanism however by  pawlenty had reversed his position and called capandtrade overly bureaucratic and a potential disaster by  pawlentys position had changed sufficiently to state the weight of the evidence is that most of it maybe all of it is because of natural causes health in  minnesotas star tribune newspaper opined that the credibility of pawlentys commissioner of health dianne mandernach suffered when a website posting by the department suggested that abortion might have a role in breast cancer she also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners in  mandernach resigned in  pawlenty asked a us senate subcommittee to allow his minnesotacare health plan to expand and

connect minneapolis and saint paul in vetoing the expenditure pawlenty did not consult peter bell head of the metro council and project leader pawlenty stated that he vetoed the bill in order to send

disciplined way pawlenty however was supportive of the project and had requested the money in the bonding bill he submitted to the minnesota state legislature the veto disappointed some of minnesotas congressional representatives in washington including minnesotas republican senator norm coleman who pledged to raise my voice as strong as i can as loud as i can the federal commitment is there

professor larry jacobs said that slowing down state spending and opposing tax increases were the signature issue of pawlentys governorship in his first year as governor pawlenty inherited a projected twoyear budget deficit of  billion the largest in minnesotas history after a contentious budget session with a democratcontrolled senate he signed a package of fee increases spending reductions and government reorganization which eliminated the deficit the budget reduced the rate of funding increases for state services including transportation social services and welfare it also enacted a

pawlenty announced the following day that he would appeal he filed his defense in february and arguments were heard on march  in may the supreme court affirmed judge gearin deciding that because the legislative and executive branches never enacted a balanced budget for the – biennium use of the unallotment power to address the unresolved deficit exceeded the authority granted to the executive branch by the statute pawlenty responded i will fight to reduce spending and taxes in minnesota and that battle continues my commitment to the people of minnesota remains the same we will balance the

million expansion of the states civil commitment program for sexual offenders maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment programs cost under control according to a single report in the star tribune a report on minnesotas sexoffender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee

from  to  these numbers however are not inflationadjusted university of minnesota political science professor larry jacobs said that slowing down state spending and opposing tax increases were the

taxes in minnesota and that battle continues my commitment to the people of minnesota remains the same we will balance the budget without raising taxes after the court ruling as the  legislative session drew to a close pawlenty vetoed a budget which would fix a billion deficit by adding a new tax bracket for sixfigure incomes in response to the proposal he criticized democrats for attempting

social sciences portion yecke revised and expanded material based on the response even as both legislative houses passed the academic standards bill her confirmation as commissioner was rejected by the dfl majority minnesota senate she was seen as an outsider coming from virginia and became unpopular for having pushed the academic reforms during a tight budget session as well as her critical look of minnesota schools in her confirmation hearing dflers also noted concern over her conservative viewpoints in june  pawlenty proposed the achieve program for the top  of high school graduates the program would pay for tuition for the first  years  years for selected fields such as science technology engineering and math and would cost the state an estimated  million per year cycle however

connect minneapolis and saint paul in vetoing the expenditure pawlenty did not consult peter bell head of the metro council and project leader pawlenty stated that he vetoed the bill in order to send a message to the legislature which had exceeded his initial budget request that they needed to stay focused be fiscally disciplined set priorities and solve this budget crisis in a fiscally disciplined way pawlenty however was supportive of the project and had requested the money in the bonding bill he submitted to the minnesota state legislature the veto disappointed some of minnesotas congressional representatives in washington including minnesotas republican senator norm coleman who pledged to raise my voice as strong as i can as loud as i can the federal commitment is there though pawlentys veto might have delayed the ability of the state to receive federal matching funds for the project bell said the project was not derailed the central corridor funding issue was resolved on may   with the state pledging its original amount towards the project after legislators compromised with pawlentys budget requests there were republican state legislators who supported other cuts of the bonding bill including doug magnus the ranking republican on the house transportation finance division who praised pawlentys fiscal responsibility critics including chris coleman

sex offenses from  years to  years and increased it further for repeat offenders at the same time he advocated for a million expansion of the states civil commitment program for sexual offenders maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment programs cost under control according to a single report in the star tribune a report on minnesotas sexoffender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governors skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders early in  after issuing a study that estimated the cost of illegal immigration to the state as approximately  million pawlenty announced a program for changing the way the state dealt with persons who were in the united states illegally pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify

of it maybe all of it is because of natural causes health in  minnesotas star tribune newspaper opined that the credibility of pawlentys commissioner of health dianne mandernach suffered when a
