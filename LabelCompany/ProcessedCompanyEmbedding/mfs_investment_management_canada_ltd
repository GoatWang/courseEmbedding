investors quiver among the most powerful is time yet many asset managers and owners dont fully grasp how powerful an impact time can have on investment decisionmaking and outcomes lengthening the investment time horizon investors are increasingly short term in their orientation even while demographic trends point to longer life expectancy and the need for larger pools of retirement funds refining instant gratification is fleeting true fulfillment takes time but offers greater potential reward time is a terrible thing to waste investors misperceptions about what impacts their outcomes often make them spend too much time measuring what doesnt matter and not enough time on what does its time to start looking at what really counts when choosing an investment manager more time for active how does investor tolerance for underperformance line up with their understanding of a longterm perspective our active sentiment study looked at their thoughts behaviors and the connections between the two growing recognizing potential takes insight making something of it takes passion and patience making sense of misalignment given the powerful relationship between decisionmaking and

active managers try to find these companies much earlier on in the curve with an eye toward tapping greater growth potential crafting when patience action and insight work in harmony risk can be an ally not an adversary risk management it’s all about culture for many investors risk is frequently an unwelcome four letter word we are all too familiar with the painful consequences of unforeseen and excessive risks taken in the financial markets not least of all the economic fallout from the global financial crisis in – and yet in the investment context it is a truism that returns can only be generated when calculated risks are taken risk managing from all angles in the countless discussions ive had with clients about the best way to manage risk in a portfolio the critical takeaway is
