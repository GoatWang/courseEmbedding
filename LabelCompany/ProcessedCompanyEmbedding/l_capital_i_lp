large appreciation potential with medium risk total returns will be enhanced by the large dividendthe risk factors to consider include possible dilution and debt levelscapital product partners lp nasdaqcplp is a greecebased limited partnership providing crude oil petroleum products and fuel transportation with a fleet of  vessels via marketsmith overview of current earnings via cplp capital product partners lp the partnerships net income for the quarter ended december   was  million compared with  million for the fourth quarter of  and  million for the previous quarter ended september   after taking into account the preferred interest in net income attributable to the unit holders of the  class b convertible preferred units outstanding as of december   the class b units and the class b unitholders and the interest attributable to the general partner net income per common unit for the quarter ended december   was  compared to  for the fourth quarter of  and  for the previous quarter ended september   total revenues for the fourth quarter of  reached  million an increase of  compared to  million during the fourth quarter of  the increase in total revenues was primarily a result of the expansion of our fleet partly offset by the reduction in the charter rate payable to our vessels under charter with hmm following its financial restructuring in july  as of december   total partners capital amounted to  million a decrease of  million compared to  million as of december   the decrease primarily reflects distributions declared and paid during  in the total amount of  million partially offset by our net income for the year ended december   the net proceeds from the issuance of common units under our atthemarket equity offering the atm offering and the equity compensation expense debt as of december   the partnerships total debt increased by  million to  million compared to  million as of december   the increase was due to a  million drawdown under our  million senior secured credit facility with ing bank to fund the acquisition of the mv cma cgm magdalena which was delivered in february  and the assumption of a  million term loan under a new credit facility with ing bank in relation to the acquisition of the mt amor in the fourth quarter of  market commentary via cplp product  crude tanker markets product tanker spot rates remained depressed for most of the fourth quarter of  but saw a gradual improvement towards the latter part of the threemonth period in the first month of the quarter the market was under pressure as lack of arbitrage opportunities and high product inventories had a negative impact on mediumrange tanker mr chartering activity offsetting firm us and chinese product exports industry expectations analysts have revised their demand growth estimate for containerized cargo for fullyear  down to  from  in the previous quarter with net fleet growth for  also being revised downwards to  from  in the previous quarter potential dilution via the earnings press release mr jerry kalogiratos chief executive and chief financial officer of the partnerships general partner fourth we launched an atm offering for up to  million with the aim of raising further capital over a period of time for vessel acquisitions debt repayment or refinancing and general corporate purposes we aim to only gradually execute the offering the possibility of an offering presents uncertainty to the share price as current shareholders could be diluted in the future the company has fewer alternatives to get financing due to current market conditions and the current debt load its important for investors to realize that the possibility of an offering creates uncertainty and adds volatility to the shares many companies in this sector are issuing stock as a source of funds for example navios maritime partners nysenmm just issued an offering of m this week financials as we review the financials we can see that despite a significant industry downturn over the past  months cplp is still in adequate shape in terms of the balance sheet and financial flexibility balance sheet via the company presentation slide deck the company describes their balance sheet as strong as a value investor i would describe the cplp balance sheet as adequate but not strong specifically the m in debt is considerable even accounting for the asset value of their vessels and fixed assets at a  discount i do not see a large margin of safety at the current time and that is a concern however i think that the debt load is only a moderate concern for investors at this time earnings strength the earnings strength of the company is what i find their strength not the balance sheet as presented we see the consistent earnings of the company over the last  years it should not be overlooked by investors that the company was able to stay profitable during this downturn when many of their competitors like dryships nasdaqdrys were struggling for survival valuation estimates are for cplp to earn  share this year ibdmarketsmith current pe is  the pe is constrained due to industry pressure and fears that the worst of the downturn in the sector is not yet over if market conditions were to return to normal the typical pe of the company over the last  years is  so at current earnings we could expect a valuation of  or a  rise from current levels it should be noted that investors who have attempted to play a quick rebound in the sector have been burned and i make no predictions as to when investors will regain confidence in the sector and allow valuations to return to normal however the earnings and dividend make the risk reward favorable to wait during the interim sentiment and institutional interest in the latest quarter we can see that  funds have sold their stakes in the company this is the reason why the pe relative to the historical price is so low institutions have taken a wait and see approach to the shares also since losses in the industry have been so pronounced institutions have realized that they took too much risk in their exposure to the sector as institutions return to the sector we expect to see the pe return to normal levels and the shares appreciate via ibdmarketismith attractive valuation cash flow the shares generate a healthy cash flow of  per share which is extremely attractive for a  stock again due to the consistency of the earnings even during this downturn this makes the shares that much more attractive book value the shares are currently trading at  of book value ibdmarketsmith as a value investor in a distressed industry i am comforted by the relative value displayed by the low book value however book value alone is not enough to make any security in this situation worth purchasing the industry is in distress so logic dictates that the only potential acquirer of a vessel would be another distressed competitor additionally it requires time to liquidate a fixed asset into cash book value alone is no guarantee of safety dividends current dividends of  per share or  annually make for a nice enhancement to the total return again the shares are not attractive just for the dividend but for the ability of the business to generate income and the strength of the balance sheet because it is difficult to predict when investors will return to the sector and allow the shares to trade at a normal pe it is certainly attractive to have a large dividend to support the shares and enhance the total return finally if the industry suffered another downturn which i view as unlikely due to the industry trends mentioned previously the company has the financial flexibility to reduce or cut the dividend again i am not suggesting this is likely however it adds an extra layer of security as we evaluate the risk reward of the company technical analysis overview unfortunately the shares are still in a downtrend but a bottoming process seems to be underway at  the stock sits right under the day and  day moving averages the stock needs to hold this level or the stock could retest the  level what would indicate a new uptrend would be a break above the  level ideally with a surge in volume indicating increasing institutional interest in the shares conclusion based on the consistent earnings and balance sheet the shares present an attractive combination of medium risk with high appreciation potential risk factors include possible dilution debt and uncertainty as to when the industry will regain favor with investors for investors willing to assume medium levels of
