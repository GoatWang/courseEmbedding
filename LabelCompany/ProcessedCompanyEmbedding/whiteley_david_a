your firm on twain in walden the first was the reason we chose you for the second your teams knowledge if structure design and of how to get things done was and is impressive and you are just fun to work alongside the second project to us was massive but with close consideration to our needs desires and input we have a beautiful home in the community we have chosen to live we had anticipated some structural damage but what you found and documented for me was considerable fixed we are beyond pleased ecstatic comes to mind looking forward to our next adventure jim and sandy robinson shearer residence diane and david were awesome to work with on remodeling our master bath they transformed it from a  bathroom to a beautiful and updated room that we just love diane went out of her way to make certain we were happy with all stages of the remodel the entire room was demolished which included removing the bathtub moving the vanity from one side of the room to the other replacing all the tile from the floor and shower removing linen closet and cabinets we now have the most gorgeous bathroom with a shower that we love custom made wardrobe linen closet and vanity with beautiful granite countertops new lighting gorgeous tile and a remodel of the closet we love our new bathroom and cant say enough good things about whiteley and whiteley we would highly recommend diane and david for your new remodeling project shearer residence dunlap residence i chose whiteley and whiteley for the remodel of the escondido home for two main reasons first their reputation precedes them it was obvious from the first meeting they would be my contractor they listened intently to my requirements and immediately had suggestions to better the end result secondly you occasionally get a premonition some say a gut feeling that this team belongs here that premonition turned out to be absolutely founded the planning stage was smooth and understandable to the lay person with thoughtfulness and professionalism not often seen the whiteleys were clear and concise with drawings cost and work schedules i found the whiteley way to fit my needs perfectly from demo to finish scheduling was flawless and each and every subordinate contractor was a true artisan if minor issues arose they were handled quickly and efficiently it was amazing to watch this team carry out the plan with an an almost uncanny ability to think on their feet while cudos go to the craftsmen the highest accolades must go to diane and david for assembling the best of the best and leading this project to fruition ill leave the before and after photos to speak for themselves but the true result of this project is so much more than that i got a beautiful remodel peace of mind as to its structural integrity and longevity but most importantly a bevy of new friends never to be forgotten dunlap residence brookhaven residence we asked whiteley and whiteley to come back and convert our attic to the ultimate leisure space because they did such a quality custom job building our home their experience knowledge and wonderful relationship with their subcontractors made the experience positive and engaging their design and vision for the space resulted in a billiard room and separate movie theater that went beyond our expectations and imagination we couldnt have worked with a better team david and diane whiteley have been a wonderful experience brookhaven residence berkley residence we first started our work relationship with whiteley  whiteley during the fall of  we had just moved to the area and needed some guidance picking colors and furniture for our new home diane would listen to my ideas and find a way to implement them while adding a designer touch in the end the finished product was perfection so naturally two years later when we decided to add an addition to our home we knew exactly who to call as before dianne and david listened to our ideas and soon a plan was in place to transform our backyard they custom built our outdoor living space picking colors material patterns lights and so much more in the end we were absolutely overly pleased this company is loyal to their word always professional and a joy to work with they will go above and beyond so that in the end you are overwhelmingly pleased berkley residence chippers crossing remodel

whiteley  whiteley design as david is truly creative thoughtful detailed and experienced david designed our dream home in  and today we remain  satisfied  there is nothing we would add change or delete if we could do it all over again our waterfront home was never a simple design and included over  square feet with numerous unique features the design included a totally self contained apartment suite for my elderly mother and it is the ultimate motherinlaw suite  very private yet right here with us it is approximately  square feet and offers everything any luxury home would offer  a spacious layout numerous builtins recessed and rope lighting full kitchen laundry sitting area huge master closet linen closet two coat closets and walkin shower david also had the foresight to recommend we build for the future by ensuring my mothers suite would fully accommodate any potential future needs we heeded his advice and david designed it to accommodate my mother in the event a wheel chair or walker were ever to become necessary that was a blessing as she recently needed that capability the rest of our home was also perfectly and uniquely designed family and guests have repeatedly applauded the open and spacious unique design often noting there is zero wasted space my wife and i are detailoriented perfectionists probably to a fault and david worked diligently with us

seating areas where we can either relax after a long day or entertain friends the design has met all of our wants and needs exceeding our expectations diane and david were a pleasure to work with

storage look for montgomery designbuilders that specialize in the areas youre looking for budget is obviously a determining factor in the outcome of your project to make sure you stay within your means consider making a musthave list and a wish list gauge where the estimates are falling to determine which designbuild contract can realistically strike the balance between the twoquestions to ask a prospective montgomery designbuilder how long have you been in the designbuild construction business how many projects like mine have you completed who will be working on the project are the workers employees or subcontractors can you provide me with references who is your designer and what are his or her qualifications are your employees licensed and insured how do you charge and what does that include can you give me a written estimate what do your services include when can this job get done what happens when cost exceeds the budget what about changes to materials or labor pricing what will i need to provide are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this projectfind a montgomery designbuild company on houzz narrow your search in the professionals section of the
