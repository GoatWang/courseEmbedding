information request email notification mb glioblastoma multiforme gbm is the most common brain and central nervous system cns cancer accounting for  of all primary brain tumors and  of all gliomas there are an estimated  new glioblastoma cases predicted in  in the us  malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancerrelated deaths in adolescents and young adults aged  and the most common cancer occurring among  year olds in the us  while gbm is a rare disease  cases per  person life years in us and eu it is quite lethal with year survival rates historically less than    chemotherapy with temozolomide and radiation are shown to extend mean overall survival from  to  months while surgery remains the standard of care  gbm remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments  ilrα is an attractive target for car t therapy as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is overexpressed on the surface of greater than  of gbm’s  car t cells are designed to express membranetethered il receptor ligand il with high affinity for ilrα and reduced binding to ilrα in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting we are developing an optimized car t product incorporating enhancements in car design and t cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and t cell persistence we include a second generation hinge optimized car containing mutations in the igg linker to reduce off target fc interactions as well as the bb cd costimulatory signaling domain for improved survival and maintenance of memory t cells as well as extracellular domain of cd as a selectionsafety marker in order to further improve persistence central memory t cells tcm are isolated and enriched the manufacturing process limits ex vivo expansion in order to reduce t cell exhaustion and maintain a tcm phenotype in collaboration with the coh we have an ongoing phase i clinical study to assess the feasibility and safety of using tcm enriched ilrαspecific car engineered t cells and are currently treating patients with recurrentrefractory gbm we will assess the t cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells to determine a recommended phase ii dose “car t cells eliminate tumor cells in tissue culture” courtesy of
