place as much emphasis on valuation and protection of capital as we do on the growth potential of a company philosophy mar vista invests in high quality growth businesses trading at discounts to fair value specifically we look for companies with sustainable competitive advantages and abundant opportunities to grow and reinvest capital at high rates of return we also seek management teams with a proven ability to allocate capital in ways that maximize shareholder value our bottomup approach is unique to other growth managers in that we place as much emphasis on valuation and protection of capital as we do on the growth potential of a company we prefer businesses that can grow profits at high rates but will not invest if the stock price already reflects these opportunities we value companies as private entities discounting free cash flows or economic value added to determine what the business is worth we then compare this number to the price the market is currently willing to pay our required margin of safety or discount to fair value varies depending on the stability and predictability of the business the wider the range of potential outcomes the higher the margin of safety we demand we sell an investment when the market price exceeds our estimate of fair value the fundamentals fall short of our investment thesis or when there are more attractive investment alternatives in our view mar vista’s longer term investment horizon  years or more creates a significant competitive advantage our willingness to look beyond the next several quarters to assess the true cash flow potential of a business creates numerous lowerrisk investment opportunities often what is perceived to be the maximum point of uncertainty is in reality the best entry point since the
