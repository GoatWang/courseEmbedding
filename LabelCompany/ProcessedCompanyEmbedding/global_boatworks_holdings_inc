distribute the luxuria vessels through direct company sales to customers boat dealerships yacht brokers and real estate brokers   manufacturing   we do not have a written agreement with any manufacturer obligating them to manufacture our vessels in the process of constructing luxuria i we have found that there are suitable manufacturers who will be available on commercially reasonable terms as subcontractors to us   upon completion of manufacturing we plan to dock our vessels in fort lauderdale florida we believe there are numerous marinas with dockage available on commercially reasonable terms   revenues   we will generate revenue from the rental of miss leah until it is sold and from the rental and sale of completed luxuria model vessels upon completion of a luxuriaclass vessel it will be used as a short term vacation rental until sold we plan to dock the completed vessels at bahia mar marina in fort lauderdale florida where the vessel can be viewed and rented at a rate of approximately  per night until sold the company has pledged the miss leah and luxuria i and luxuria ii vessels as security for the repayment of certain notes therefore the proceeds of such sales will first go to the repayment of the secured indebtedness        target customers   our target customers are owners of marinas and other businesses and individuals seeking unique rental properties for their customers corporations seeking a unique venue for company events and functions persons seeking a vacation or second home on the water and individuals seeking to live on a floating vessel with the amenities commonly found in a home   marketing   we have implemented a marketing strategy primarily part of our sales and marketing efforts will be to participate in boat shows and sales events at south florida boating locations typically held in january february and march of each year these shows and events are normally held at convention centers or marinas with area boat distributors and dealers renting space and displaying product information for consumers boat shows and other offsite promotions will be an important venue for generating sales we believe that a marketing strategy focused on boat shows and related events social media print advertising and internet advertising will provide potential customers with the opportunity to view our information about our vessels which is an optimal strategy to increase sales we market our rentals through homeaway and vacation rentals by owner vrbo property we occupy dockage space pursuant to an agreement with

which provided for up to  in debt funding to the company inclusive of an original issue discount of  dependence on a few customers we are not dependent on one  or a few customers and we do not expect to be so in the future product liability the sale of vessels may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims we could be included as a defendant in product liability claims relating to defects in manufacture or design of our vessels we plan to require manufacturers of our vessels to carry and provide proof of product liability insurance we also maintain thirdparty product liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence which may not be sufficient for claims against us additionally we carry  of coverage per occurrence for damage to our company owed vessel there can be no assurance that we will not experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims that are ultimately not covered by our insurance policy if significant claims are made against us our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected  competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in addition to facing competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending dollars the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented resulting in intense competition we complete with single location boat dealers and to a lesser degree with national specialty marine stores catalog retailers sporting goods stores and mass merchants competition is based on the quality of available products the price and value of the products and attention to customer service there is significant competition in the markets which we plan to enter our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial marketing and other resources than us there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition seasonality our business as well as the entire recreational boating industry is highly seasonal generally boat sales increase starting in january with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in south florida and continue through march our business will be affected by weather patterns which may adversely impact our future operating results for example hurricanes in the south florida area or reduced rainfall levels as well as excessive rain may render boating dangerous or inconvenient thereby curtailing customer demand for our products in addition unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations the overall impact on our business from adverse weather conditions in any one  market area will continue to represent potential material adverse risks to our financial performance intellectual property we have not registered or patented any intellectual property trademarks and trade names distinguish companies from each other if customers are unable to distinguish our products from those of other companies we could lose sales to our competitors we do not have any registered trademarks and trade names so we only have common law rights with respect to infractions or infringements on its products many subtleties exist in product descriptions offering and names that can easily confuse customers the name of our principal products may be found in numerous variations of the name and descriptions in various media and product labels this presents a risk of losing potential customers looking for our products and buying someone elses because they cannot differentiate between them legal proceedings we are not a party to any legal proceedings      item a risk factors in addition to the information discussed elsewhere in this annual report the following are important risks which could adversely affect our future results if any of the risks we describe below materialize or if any unforeseen risk develops our operating results may suffer our financial condition may deteriorate the trading price of our common stock may decline and our investors could lose all or part of their investment risks related to our financial condition   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our limited operating history and financial resources and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations we incurred net losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended december   and december   respectively as a result our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that we may be unable to continue as a going concern our limited operating history and financial resources raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our consolidated financial statements contain a going concern qualification  our consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations we are an early stage company with little or no historical performance for you to base an investment decision upon and we may never become profitable we are a recently formed company for the fiscal years ended december   and december   we had revenues of  and  respectively for the fiscal years ended december   and december   we have a net loss of  and  respectively accordingly we have limited historical performance upon which you may evaluate our prospects for achieving our business objectives and becoming profitable in light of the risks difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies such as us accordingly before investing in our common stock you should consider the challenges expenses and difficulties that we will face as an early stage company and whether we will ever become profitable we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances loans andor financial guarantees if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues for our operating expenses we will need financing which we may be unable to obtain should we fail to obtain sufficient financing our revenues will be negatively impacted because we have limited revenues and lack historical financial data including revenue data our future revenues are unpredictable our operating expenses are approximately  per month or  annually we will require  per month or  over the next twelve  months to meet our operational costs which consist of rent advertising salaries and other general administrative expenses to comply with the costs of being an sec reporting company we are obligated to repay outstanding indebtedness in excess of  during the next  months  there is no assurance we will have sufficient funds available to implement our plan of operations which could cause you to lose your investment until we generate material operating revenues we require additional debt or equity funding to continue our operations and implement our plan of operations we intend to raise additional funds from an offering of our stock in the future however this offering may never occur or if it occurs we may be unable to raise the required funding we do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding and we have no agreements for financing in place expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we recently became a publicly traded company operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance for legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements we anticipate that the cost of sec reporting will be approximately  annually our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our sec reporting obligations investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly annual reports and other required sec reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a nonreporting issuer risks related to our business our business is subject to significant regulations which increase our operating costs if we fail to comply with these regulations our operations will be negatively impacted our business involves the use handling storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes including environmentally sensitive materials such as motor oil waste motor oil and filters transmission fluid antifreeze freon waste paint and lacquer thinner batteries solvents lubricants degreasing agents gasoline and diesel fuels accordingly we are subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities establishing requirements for the use management handling and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards and liability related thereto and providing penalties for violations of those standards regulatory approval processes may be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and our failure to obtain or comply with these approvals or clearances could harm our business financial condition and operating results our industry is highly competitive and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our market share financial condition and future growth we operate in a highly competitive environment in addition to facing competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending dollars the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented resulting in intense competition we compete with single location boat and yacht dealers and to a lesser degree with national specialty marine stores dealer competition is based on the quality of available products the price and value of the products and attention to customer service there is significant competition in the markets which we plan to enter  our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial marketing and other resources than us there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition because miss leah luxuria i and luxuria ii our company owned vessels are pledged as security for loans if we default on the loans we would lose our primary assets and might not be able to continue our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment on august   we entered into a securities purchase agreement and note with tonaquint inc pursuant to which we pledged the miss leah as security for the note we are obligated to pay the entire principal and interest on may   the loan is secured by the miss leah our company owned vessel because miss leah is our primary asset and is pledged as security for a loan you could lose your investment if we default on the loan because of our limited revenues and weak financial condition we may not be able to make the loan payment when due on may   this would cause us to lose our primary asset and we might not be able to implement our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment on january   we entered into a securities purchase agreement and note with st george investments llc pursuant to which we pledged the luxuria i and luxuria ii as security for the note we are obligated to pay the entire principal and interest on october   because the luxuria i and luxuria ii are primary assets and are pledged as security for a loan you could lose your investment if we default on the loan because of our limited revenues and weak financial condition we may not be able to make the loan payment when due on october   this would cause us to lose our primary assets and we might not be able to continue our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment the purchase of our products is discretionary and may be negatively impacted by adverse trends in the general economy and make it more difficult for us to generate revenues our business is affected by general economic conditions since our products are discretionary and we depend to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these factors include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers employment rates the level of consumers disposable income business conditions interest rates consumer debt levels and availability of credit consumer spending on our products may be adversely affected by negative trends and changes in general economic conditions the success of our business depends on our ability to market our luxuria vessels effectively our ability to establish effective marketing and advertising campaigns is the key to our success our advertisements must effectively promote our corporate image our luxuria vessels and the pricing of such products if we are unable to create awareness of our products we may not be able to attract customers our marketing activities may not be successful in promoting the products we sell or pricing strategies or in retaining and increasing our customer base we cannot assure you that our marketing programs will be adequate to create a demand for our products support our future growth which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  we may be subject to product liability claims and we do not have insurance coverage for such claims which could negatively impact our financial condition   by selling boats we will face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury or death also in the event that any of the components of our vessels is defective we may be required to recall or replace such components we maintain product liability insurance coverage in the amount of  to protect us from such claims which may not be sufficient coverage for claims against us a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would negatively impact our business and cause you to lose your investment   we may be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to sell some of our products   we have no secured intellectual property protection of the global boatworks or luxuria names our industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for several companies third parties may assert claims of misappropriation of trade secrets or infringement of intellectual property rights against us for which we may be liable   if our business expands the number of products and competitors in our markets increases and product overlaps occur infringement claims may increase in number and significance intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims further many potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources than we can to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing our products   if we fail to develop the global boatworks and luxuria brand costeffectively our business may be adversely affected   the success of our products marketed under the global boatworks and luxuria brands will depend upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and even if they do any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building the brands if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brandbuilding efforts and our business and results of operations could suffer   risks related to our management   should we lose the services of robert rowe our chief executive officer president treasurer and director our financial condition and proposed expansion may be negatively impacted   our future depends on the continued contributions of robert rowe our chief executive officer president treasurer and director who would be difficult to replace mr rowe is our only fulltime employee mr rowes services are critical to the management of our business and operations we do not maintain key man life insurance on mr rowe should we lose the services of mr rowe we may be unable to replace his services with equally competent and experienced personnel and our operational goals and strategies may be adversely affected which will negatively affect our potential revenues    certain officers and directors devote limited time to our business which may negatively impact upon our plan of operations implementation of our business plan and our potential profitability   our chief executive officer president treasurer and director robert rowe is our only full time employee leah rowe our secretary spends approximately fifteen  hours per week on our business the limited amount of fulltime employees we employ may be inadequate to implement our plan of operations and develop a profitable business   our officers and directors have no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting   we have never operated as a public company and our management has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful  we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected   we incur additional costs and management time related expenses pertaining to sec reporting obligations and sec compliance matter and our management has no experience in such matters   robert rowe our chief executive officer president treasurer and director is responsible for managing us including compliance with sec reporting obligations and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting these public reporting requirements and controls are new to these individuals and at times will require us to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting or other professionals that will increase our costs of doing business  should we fail to comply with sec reporting and internal controls and procedures we may be subject to securities law violations that may result in additional compliance costs or costs associated with sec judgments or fines each of which would increase our costs and negatively affect our potential profitability and our ability to conduct our business   because we do not have an audit or compensation committee shareholders will be required to rely on the members of our board of directors who are not independent to perform these functions   we do not have an audit or compensation committee or board of directors as a whole that is composed of independent directors because our directors are also our officers and controlling shareholders they are not independent there is a potential conflict between their or our interests and our shareholders interests since our directors are also our officers who will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions until we have an audit or compensation committee or independent directors there may be less oversight of management decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders    we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act  for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanes oxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved  we could be an emerging growth company for up to five  years although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  if we issue more than  in nonconvertible debt in a three  year period or if the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeds  as of any april th date before that time in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following april th  we cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates risks related to our common stock   our officers and directors have voting control over all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders which will prevent our minority shareholders from having the ability to control any of our corporate actions   as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding each entitled to one vote per common share our chief executive officer president treasurer and director robert rowe beneficially owns  common shares which represents approximately sixtythree percent  of our outstanding shares this entitles mr rowe to control all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders as a result our management has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors our managements control of our voting securities may make it impossible to complete some corporate transactions without its support and may prevent a change in our control in addition this ownership could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an antitakeover effect possibly depressing the trading price of our common stock   we will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define socalled penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exemptions we anticipate that our common stock will be a penny stock and we will become subject to rule g under the exchange act or the penny stock rule this rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers  for transactions covered by rule g a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale as a result this rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common shares and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our common shares in the secondary market    for any transaction other than an exempt transaction involving a penny stock the rules require delivery prior to such transaction of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market disclosure is also required to be made regarding sales commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities   finally monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock   we do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rule in any event even if our common stock is exempt from the penny stock rule we would remain subject to section b of the exchange act which gives the sec the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the sec finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest   sales of our common stock under rule  could reduce the price of our stock   in general persons holding restricted securities in a sec reporting company including affiliates must hold their shares for a period of at least six months may not sell more than one percent  of the total issued and outstanding shares in any ninety  day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price if substantial amounts of our common stock become available for resale under rule  prevailing market prices for our common stock will be reduced we may in the future issue additional securities which would reduce investors percent of ownership and may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of blank check preferred stock as of the date of this form k we had  shares of common stock and  shares of series a redeemable preferred shares outstanding accordingly we may issue up to an additional  shares of common stock and  shares of blank check preferred stock the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis including for services or acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our stockholders and  might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock our board of directors may designate the rights terms and preferences of our authorized but unissued preferred shares at its discretion including conversion and voting preferences without notice to our shareholders    because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain future earnings if any to finance our business as a result we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future our payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after considering whether we have generated sufficient revenues our financial condition operating results cash needs growth plans and other factors accordingly investors that are seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock    as an issuer of penny stock the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us   although the federal securities law provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks as a result if we are a penny stock we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any claim that the material provided by us

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we were founded in june of  to commercialize luxury living vessels we plan to generate revenues from the sale of and rental of the vessels initially in south florida our newly developed luxuria model features a south florida modern style and is approximately one thousand six hundred fifty  square feet under air the vessel offers amenities typically found in a luxury home year ended december   and  our revenues were  and  for the year ended december   and  respectively our revenue for these two years is solely for the rental of the miss leah based in boston harbor this represents a increase of approximately sixteen point nine percent  this increase was most likely a result of our inability to rent the vessel in early  because the very severe winter weather in boston massachusetts damaged the marina facilities effectively cutting off both power  and water to the floating vessel until the marina was able to repair their utilities our cost of revenues consists of marina dockage fees and the fees of the online rental agency utilized by the company to rent the miss leah and was  and  for the year ended december   and  respectively  this represents an increase of approximately forty seven point seven percent  this increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in marina fees our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was approximately forty five point one  and thirty five point seven percent  for the year ended december   and  respectively again this increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in marina fees our gross margin was  and  for the year ended december   and  respectively our general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december

insurance office supplies repairs and maintenance management fees and travel the primary increase was officer salaries and amortization of prepaid services  our professional fees were  and  for the

interest expense was  and  for the year ended december   and  respectively an increase of  or eighteen hundred ninety three point seven percent  this increase is due to the interest expense accrued on the note payable to affiliate for the acquisition of the vessel and the amortization of prepaid interest loan fee and loan discount on the short term loan received in july  and original issue discount oid and loan discounts on the short term loan received in august  our derivative expense was  and change in fair value of derivative was  for the year ended december   and zero for the year ended

design of the luxuria model in the first quarter of  luxuria will be approximately one thousand six hundred fifty  square feet with two  bedrooms and bathrooms and sleeps up to six  people we began construction of luxuria i in march  and it is substantially complete in march  we have begun negotiating for the construction of the barge bottom for luxuria ii we plan to use the luxuria models as a shortterm vacation rental property in south florida and for outright sale we believe that using the luxuria as a shortterm vacation rental in south florida could provide a year round source of cash flow and a model for future custom build orders while rental of the miss leah presently and luxuria in the future are expected to provide a relatively steady revenue stream to us the construction and sale of custom designed and built luxury floating vessels are expected to generate significantly greater revenues and potential profits as of december  we have expended  for the construction of

luxuria i had delays due to various unforseen circumstances and changes needed during the process of construction we will require additional funds to develop and carry out our future plans including construction of our third vessel we have secured funding for the construction of luxuria ii we begin marketing each vessel when manufacturing commences our first luxuria barge bottom was delivered to
