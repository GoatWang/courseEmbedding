idea to package and distribute patented medicines and household items for country stores located in allegan michigan the l perrigo company enjoyed steady growth and by the early s perrigo was exceeding the needs of its rural store customers throughout the midwest along the way the company began leveraging the private label concept as a way to enhance customer loyalty for no additional cost

excellence perrigo opened its first manufacturing facility in allegan michigan in  and signed its first large privatelabel customer in the mids paving the way for its conversion from a repackager of home remedies to a manufacturer of affordable health care products this shift in strategic direction drove perrigos growth over the next several decades and became the foundation for the companys mission today a growing business perrigos growth was driven further by the advent of rxtooverthecounter otc switches where prescription products began to become available over the counter these
