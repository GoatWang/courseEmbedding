gonzalez media news new york times publisher arthur sulzberger jr is dating again capital new yorks joe pompeo reports that sulzbergers newest girlfriend is a private equity director named gabrielle greenethe two made an appearance together at the papers headquarters for a party for advertisers earlier this week and the couple posed for pictures at the financial timess th anniversary party last month heres a photo of the happy coupleyou may remember sulzbergers previous girlfriend claudia gonzalez sulzberger separated from his wife five years ago gonzalez was the one who apparently caused quite a bit of tension between arthur and janet robinson the times longtime chief executive robinson was shown the door unexpectedly in december then again it couldnt be that unexpected that gonzalez would have thoughts on robinsons job performance sulzberger likes to consult his significant others on business matters in alex jones and susan tifft’s great book about the sulzbergerochs family the trust they wrote of sulzbergers thenwife gail greggshe was forceful and selfassured–the very strengths he tried to cultivate in himself though his way of expressing them tended to be cocky and confrontationaltheir marriage was one of trust friendship respect political sympathy teamwork unlike punch arthurs father who never discussed business with carol arthur jr valued gail’s counsel and freely told other executives that he ran many decisions by hersulzberger broke things off with gonzalez some time last year a person familiar with the sulzbergers told me his commitment to gonzalez and apparently her young children became too much for him even after he had installed the bunk beds for her young kids our source says as for greene shes had a long background in private equity and hedge funds including a stint at bain  company she sits on the board at whole foods and were sure the times new ceo mark thompson is just thrilled with the idea of talking to her about whats happening
