ms arvia  will take over leadership of nationwide bank and move to columbus one of chicagos highest ranking female bankers her departure from shorebank effective next month is a blow to the nationally prominent community development bank which made its reputation lending to apartment rehabbers in lowincome communities on the south and west sides a year shorebank veteran and an accountant by trade ms arvia became president of shorebanks chicago operation in  and ceo of the entire bank in  shorebank has increased net income from  million in  to  million last year assets have grown in that time frame to  billion from  billion ms arvia has been instrumental in focusing shorebank on profitable business lines and shedding unprofitable ones under her leadership the bank exited auto lending and focused on areas of strength like lending to apartment owners and churches just recently ms arvia engineered shorebanks first acquisition in a decade agreeing to buy greater chicago bank of west suburban bellwood for  million mary houghton  a cofounder of shorebank and currently president of holding company shorebank corp will assume ms arvias bank duties on an interim basis the bank plans to launch a search for candidates the board of directors and the management are saddened by annes decision but recognize that her new position presents an outstanding opportunity for her to broaden her professional and personal experiences said an internal memo from shorebank chairman and cofounder ron grzywinski observers expect the bank to find a replacement from outside its ranks finding the right person could be a challenge given shorebanks unique community development culture for years much of the banks profits have been plowed into environmental projects and community development loans in communities all over the country and countries as far away as afghanistan for shorebank choices will have to be made about future direction ms arvia said with profit margins from lending narrowing the bank is looking for ways to increase its fee income it will look for new markets to enter the bellwood acquisition which is expected to close in september is a good example of a first step that

nationwides agents or the internet to building retail branches in certain markets its truly a clean state at this point she said she also wanted to try her skills at a bigger company nationwide had revenue of  billion last year and has a market capitalization of  billion while her salary will grow that wasnt the key to her decision she said its not the driver i can honestly say that she said the
