the state of delaware for the right or privilege to own a delaware company the tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company   the term franchise tax does not imply that your company is a franchise business  when is it due the due date of your tax varies depending on your company type   the franchise tax for a corporation is due by march  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before march  the state imposes a  late penalty plus a monthly interest fee of  percent   the franchise tax for a delaware llc is due by june  of every year the limited partnership lp franchise tax is also due by june  of every year if the tax is not paid on or before june  the state imposes a  late penalty

franchise tax for a delaware limited liability company llc or delaware limited partnership lp is a flat annual rate of  as of july     the franchise tax for a corporation is a little more complicated it is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has the total cost of the franchise tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due   a nonstocknonprofit company is considered exempt with the state of delaware this type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee the annual report fee is  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax is  as of july   for a total of  per year   a corporation having  authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation the annual report fee is  and the tax would be somewhere between  and  per year   there are two methods to calculate a maximum stock companys franchise tax they are the authorized shares method   the state of delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes this method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares the calculation is as follows  shares or less  as of july      shares  as of july   additional  shares or portion thereof add  the maximum annual tax is    dont forget to add the  annual report fee to the franchise tax after it is calculated   the assumed par value capital method the state of delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods therefore if you receive a bill from delaware for tens of thousands of dollars it may be in your best interest to try calculating your franchise tax with the assumed par value capital method   in order to utilize this filing method you will need to provide the companys total gross assets as reported on the form  schedule l and the total number of issued shares many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of  franchise tax plus the  annual report fee   the calculation used for this method is more complex please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you we will be happy
