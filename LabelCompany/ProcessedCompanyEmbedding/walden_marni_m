job of merging yahoo with aol which verizon bought for  billion last year as verizons executive vice president and president of product innovation walden is in charge of evolving verizon from an analog business into a firm that can battle with the digital media giants and explore new technology like the internet of things and telematics by acquiring yahoo verizon has doubled the size of its internet advertising business in the us it is poised to hold an estimated  share of the us digital ad market behind facebook  and google  now the job is to work out which parts of yahoo to keep to grow the business even further both yahoo and aol own content and advertising technology businesses and waldens task will be to select the right mix of components to ensure that the merged entity works efficiently tim armstrong aols ceo said in a statement monday that the transaction was about unleashing yahoos full potential building upon our collective synergies and strengthening and accelerating that growth with yahoo ceo marissa mayer announcing that she intends to stay at the company once the deal closes working out how armstrong and mayer can work together — or on who will replace mayer — will be one of waldens first tasks it comes just two years after armstrong proposed a merger with yahoo that mayer rejected so far walden has allowed armstrong to run the business fairly independently but it remains to be seen what will change now that verizon has yahoo in its portfolio who is marni walden verizon bloomberg published a profile of walden earlier this month detailing her lifelong career in the wireless industry the yearold executive was named into her current position in february  before that she was verizons executive vice president and chief operating

entire career in the mobile business in some way in  in her first job after graduating from california state university at chico she sold briefcase phones for general cellular inside a homeimprovement store bloomberg reported in an interview with recode late last year when asked about the speculation that verizon might buy yahoo walden explained verizons media aspirations what i would tell you is we didnt get into the media company business just to be a singledigit market share player thats not why we did the deal with aol we have much bigger aspirations of how we want to grow that business some can happen because of the scale verizon brings but we will continue to look at how we scale and be a meaningful player from a doubledigit market share and by market share i think about revenue we definitely will look to build this business as well as helping lead the yahoo and aol deals walden has overseen the launch of verizons mobile video streaming service go which has reportedly gotten off to a slow start verizon has not released numbers on how the service is performing but it has signed up content partners including the nfl the nba and vice media bloomberg described waldens management style as efficient but with a playful style if someone shows up late to one of her meetings she fires up a karaoke machine and requires the laggard to sing as punishment the punctuality rule applies to everyone including aols armstrong who recalls having to sing john denvers take me home country roads as penance walden remembers it as the softrock standard feelings walden is on a short list of candidates to replace lowell mcadam as verizons ceo according to bloomberg her success in handling the integration of yahoo could well see walden become verizons first female ceo get the latest yahoo
