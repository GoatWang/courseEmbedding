selecting investments is an entrepreneurial process and our longterm record is possible because our approach and ideas do not reflect the group psychology of the investment community our philosophyinvestment perspectiveevery firm has its own philosophy of business a set of principles that governs the way it conducts its affairs  this is most important in the investment counseling profession where knowledge judgment foresight and perspective are key ingredients to a successful and continuing relationship  we believe successful longterm investing is based on the growth of value made possible by economic expansion and corporate innovation both of which are likely to continuethe world economy will expand and advance in the future as it has in the past  more goods and services will be needed to meet the everexpanding world population  higher demand will inevitably lead to advances in technology and research creating new products adding jobs increasing productivity and building economic wealthinflation will remain a key factor for all investors  the value of the dollar has declined for over fifty consecutive years  even at  inflation the value of the dollar will decline to  cents over an average investment lifetime of fifty years and by onefourth every ten yearsperspective is important and patience necessary in achieving longterm investment success  we do not emphasize the short run and we are unable to help those who follow an inandout trading approachinvestment selectionwe conduct our own independent research  we invest substantially each year to acquire outside expertise in the fields of economics industry analysis company research taxation law and political analysis  government statistics and brokerage research are also drawn upon for input into our studiesour examination of investments is a fundamental analysis and we are disciplined in our valuation judgments  our recommendations reflect an assessment of both the underlying investment merits of
