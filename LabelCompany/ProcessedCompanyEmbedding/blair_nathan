page rheo blair supplements nathans notes on rheo blairs secrets following our conversation with nathan we now share detailed information he has from extensive notes he took during the hours spent with rheo on the phone in the early s we have here his complete program consisting of secrets rheo shared only with his advanced clients this will entail two posts describing first the quantity of supplements he used and and a description of each and second the dietary and lifestyle regimen he got from rheo there will be more on what rheo liked to call his secrets in the second post putting it all together to achieve the big results so we begin with nathans rheo blair conversation notes on the quantities he used and his descriptions of many of the supplements much of the information that follows was originally posted by nathan in the superb forums at ironhistorycom hosted by the joe roark the posts there garnered considerable interest perhaps because there seems often to be a certain mystery and mystique that surrounds blair and his supplements the possible reasons for this are  those supplements helped produce such stunning results  his most prized products were available only to his private clients  all of the products were very costly  blair always talked about his thousand dollar secrets which also were available exclusively to his private clientele and  blair himself was something of a character an enigma a mystery given all of the above a certain lore about him his products and his overall program has grown since his death and the subsequent demise of his product line our goal is to present the facts and clarify the mystique so that all may share in the secrets of this pioneering nutritionist who touched so many lives both famous and private please note that you may learn more from our related post what about those unusual rheo blair supplements you may also type the word supplements in the google search box over in the right hand column of this page numerous articles on this site will be listed in the google results which reference the blair supplements our goal here at rheo h blair the book is to be a comprehensive onestop reference for the life and work of rheo blair we uncover more information information on  rheo and his supplements everyday most of which is unpublished but which we will share in due course in the meantime the information from nathan provides a solid overview of the rheo blair program for someone wanting to improve their physique nathan i begin by posting the total amounts blair had people use while on the big program specifically as the plan that i was on which might have varied for others regarding digestive enzymes i am sure blair used them to help with digestion of the fats in his program he was never happy with the enzyme product he had though and said so i have not included the enzyme product among the descriptions of blair products below as i dont know the exact composition of that product and dont have notes what i do recall is that the label just said digestive enzymes likely some combination of bromelain papain amylase protease and tripease regarding calories though the program was essentially a low carb program to begin with so although high in calories most guys did not put on bodyfat with it you kept the carb grams low and did not count calories if you did put on bodyfat with the protein drinks blair would do two things  have you cut back more on carbs and if that did not work then  have you go to a doctor and be tested for hypothyroidismhe had doctors in california who would receive the data for him to analyze if needed as he was not an md and your local dr might decline to give him the results some guys would consume up to  calories a day and still remain muscular at least by the standards of the day when bodybuilders were trying to cut up blair had them replace the milk with water in the drinks and cut the cream in half they would also use a lot of the amino capsules at that time but the digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid were crucial to the proper digestion and assimilation of all this fat and protein i have been asked about amounts i used while on the rheo h blair program here is exactly what he had me using on the big program i was only on this for a couple of months as it was all i could afford but my progress was the best i ever experienced in every way  i continued to use his products for many years and frequently spoke with him and later freddy on the phone for years after this as i would phone in my orders if you were a long term regular blair student he would even ship to you on open account and allow you to mail a check after you received the products naturally i always paid in a timely manner when he did this the usual reason to have him ship that way was to save time in getting the products if you were low keep in mind that the plan shown might not be the same for everyone at the time i was on this specific program i was fairly lean and wanted to to gain muscular size and strength so it would have been biased towards those needs note also my own editorial comments at the bottom here is the plan per day which luckily i wrote down over  years ago and kept vitamin a  iu i was taking one ad capsule but most of this and the d came from  cod liver oil capsulesday  vitamin d  iu also mostly from the clo but also included in this amount is what was in the calcium capsules  vitamin e  iu mixed tocopherols alpha beta gamma and delta  vitamin b  mg vitamin b  mg  vitamin b  mg  b is niacin for anyone unaware  vitamin b  mg b is pantothenic acid  vitamin b  mgb is essential to protein utilization part of this b was in the digestants  vitamin b  mcg this is an enormous amount but b is only assimilated as a fairly small percentage of intake  paba  mg paraaminobenzoicacid  folic acid  mcg   choline  mg part of this was from the lecithin capsules mentioned below  inositol  mg biotin  mcg  vitamin c  mg this was from the cbioplus product plus some ascorbic acid tablets  citrus bioflavanoids  mg  rutin  mg  magnesium  mg as magnesium aspartate  calcium  mg as citrate lactate gluconate and carbonate combination  zinc  mg i did not record what form this was in copper  mcg  manganese  mg  iodine  x rda on alternate days this was as iocen a liquid dulse product  phosphorus  mg  this was in the calcium and or protein products  trace minerals  mg  betaine hcl  mg  glutamic acid hcl  mg contained in the digestant tablets  of the tablets use per feeding  pepsin  mg contained in the digestant tablets pepsin is a nd stage digestant  protein  grams of protein from the protein powder exclusive of the protein found in the milk and eggs used to make the  protein drink and exclusive of any found in food or the liver tablet note the  grams is the protein only not the total  weight of the powder used which was about one cup by volume i could have used more as well but blair wanted me to use at least this much  liver extract  per day these would have contained iron and b but perhaps more importantly the intrinsic factors found  in liver which are known to increase endurance  soybro  per day the defatted trigerm oil product this would have naturally contained tocotrienols octacosanol and  other plant sterols  crude wheat germ fractions  per day a defatted whest germ oil product high in octacosanol the same as  minim  prometol optionally you could take  soybro per day and not this product  lecithin at one time he had me taking   mg regular lecithin capsules per day when the later smaller high potency  lecithin pc came out he recommended up to mg capsules of that type amino acids  capsules per day  lglutamine  grams per day as mg capsules  blairs free form amino acid capsules as many as you can afford was his quote for someone who had unlimited wealth the number was  per day  digestive enzymes  to  per feeding unfortunately as previously stated i did not record what was in these softone this was simple psyllium husk blair had me use  teaspoons daily mixed in water or milk not in with the protein drink this is basically a metamucil like product to help with regularity while on this diet high in dairy products with little  fiber in it otherwise total  capsulestablets per day  important blair stated that many of these nutrients should not be taken without others notably some of the bcomplex he was using amounts he thought would act synergistically it would not be wise to merely pick out some of the items listed here and take those amounts without the others it would be wiser to take for example  as much of everything and to use all of it rather than full doses of only  of the items listed product descriptions blairs soybro was a trigerm oil product  from wheat rice and soy oils but it was defatted energol  a hoffmanyork product  had the same combination of oils but was not defatted soybro was made by a company called professional labs located in iowa the idea of a defatted oil may not sound possible at first but what was removed was the heavy lipids leaving and thus concentrating the good  octacosanol tocotrienols and so on i wondered early on if soybro was just energol in capsules but that was not the case if you opened one of the soybro capsules you could tell the difference also when soybro became unavailable after rheos death  freddy linblad rheos office manager  was able to get the liquid which the capsules contained it was sold under the name soimone and was from the same lab that had made soybro they could sell the liquid in relatively small quantities but they needed an order for a million capsules or so in order to do a days production run of the capsules anyway the soimone was not oily like energol did not stick to your mouth and tongue the way energol did based on the composition of soybro it would have contained octacosanol hexacosanol tocotrienols and tocopherols although in fairly small amounts relative to the amount of those needed to have much effect on the human body so taking a few of these a day would not do much rheo had his advanced students take  soybro capsules per day blairs liver extract this was a low temperature freeze dried defatted raw liver extract in capsule form it was made at one time by a company called reheis in chicago which has not made it in many years  rheo had told me his liver extract required  lbs of raw liver to make  lb of finished product so that would be at least a  to  concentration crude wheat germ fractions was a defatted wheat germ oil product blair did not offer this on his regular price list but did sell it to his advanced  or private students it was about three times the price of soybro which was priced at approximately  and cwgf being around  today a product called prometol is the same product same shape size and color softget  same taste smell and texture of the product inside  i am dead certain they are the same thing they are a product of viobin and can be found through a lot of the big online vitamin sellers they are not cheap but you can find them from the discounters for a little under  blair suggested  per day so in  days you would take  capsules or  worth of that product alone less money adjusted for inflation than blair was selling them for  years ago but still expensive blairs lecithin pc this was really not a special product as such blair had used regular lecithin capsules particularly for students trying to lose weight and when the lecithin phosphotidyl choline hit the market he started using that up to  mg capsules per day on the big program rheo said they make the rest of the plan work better though he offered no full explanation these are available a lot of places referred to as lecithin pc or as triple strength lecithin they are as effective as a mg capsule of ordinary lecithin while having less calories and bulk and  less to digest vitamin e blairs was a regular generic product however he did use the capsules which were mixed tocopherols alpha beta gamma and delta as opposed to the simple dalpha tocopherol of many capsules he had me use  iu per day when i was on the big program vitamin c blairs were ordinary ascorbic acid the common form of c available about everywhere he had his students use large amounts on the big program the total amount he had me using at one time was  grams per day others much more bio plus this was a bioflavanoid capsule with vitamin c similar capsules are available from twinlab swanson and other suppliers blair said this enhanced the uptake of vitamin c and helped with workout recovery vitamins a and d blair had me use fish liver oil capsules to obtain these at one time i was using  of the small capsules per day he emphasized the oil should be cold processed he also said that vitamin a in particular should be from natural sources not synthetic he stated that the synthetic form for whatever reason was more likely to cause the toxic buildup problems sometimes associated with vitamin a blairs bcomplex each capsule contained mg each of b b and bniacin and paba mg of b mg of pantothenic acid  mcg of b  mcg of folic acid  mcg of biotin and some choline and inositol the difference in this product and most others of its time was that all bcomplex factors were included in it as opposed to cheaper products which often only had the numbered b vitamins it was a capsule when most of the others were still tablets also when rheo had these made he had the amounts of each component adjusted to what he felt were the right proportions as compared with many products which just had for example  units mg or mcg whichever applied of every nutrient regardless of the actual needs for each blairs b b niacin and b b none of these were anything out of the ordinary the same chemical compostion as any other brand the b and b came together in one capsule blair would have students use extra amounts of one or more of these depending upon the individuals needs he had bodybuilders and lifters use huge amounts of b at times  mcg or more due to the fact that the body will uptake a limited  of b but will uptake it in direct proportion to how much is taken the only b available at the time was cyanocobalamin i expect blair would also have been using the methylcobalamin form now available if he was living my guess is he would have combined the two extra b was used to help further faciltate protein assimilation and extra niacin is known to help distribute nutrients throughout the body the b and b capsules were to help provide extra energy blairs choline plus blair said to use this only if you were also using the bcomplex as well i dont know his reason but expect there was some issue in somehow being out of balance if you took it alone these were choline and inositol capsules  ratio of the choline to the inositol  basically it was a lipotropic fat loss product this product was mentioned in pumping iron the book as is blairs protein both on page  with mike katz and ed corney using it todays substitute would just be choline and inositol capsules probably separate in order to achieve the  ratio it is a weight loss product the way he used it i think rheo also used the amino acid methionine with students needing to take off fat if he was around today i expect he would also be using lcarnitine or the acetyl lcarntine and probably conjugated linoleic acid for students needing to lose weight iocen this was a liquid iodine product made from dulse one would take a few drops on alternate days and it would provide in his estimation all the iodine you would need softone this was nothing but blond psyllium husks a bulk fiber product about the same as metamucil blair had students use it if they had any elimination problems as a result of his program which was obviously low in fiber blairs calcium plus and calcium pf phosphorus free these two calcium products the only difference being one contained phosphorus and the other did not were superior to others on the market in their day at that time most calcium products you would see were calcium carbonate tablets which were very difficult to digest and assimilate blairs was in capsule form and consisted of calcium citrate lactate gluconate and carbonate they also contained vitamin d and some hcl to help them be easily digested in case you were wondering hcl in its dry form doesnt digest anything until dissolves in liquid such as in the stomach which is why it did not digest the capsules while still in the bottle calcium carbonate is and always was the cheapest and least bioavailable form so it is generally inferior to the other forms it makes a good antacid as it takes so much stomach acid to digest blairs magnesium blair was using magnesium aspartate when all the other formulas were the very inferior magnesium oxide today magnesium asparate citrate and orotate are available and are all good forms you can find them combined with the calcium in many formulas blairs zinc  i dont have notes on this one but i think he was using either citrate or picolinate again when everyone else was offering the cheaper and less assimible oxide form the three minerals listed are here are those blair considered most important in particular the calcium he had students using these often without having them use the other minerals such as his iron plus product all in all though these products were ahead of their time blairs amino acid capsules these were famous many top bodybuilders used these particularly when they were on restricted diets and trying to get cut for contests my understanding is that blair had these formulated to his specifications which was with the profile of whole eggs that is the aminos would be in the same proportions as they would occur in eggs they were expensive around  per  in the early s i think the peak price on them later was around  each and that was during a time frame when money was worth more than it is now part of this high price may have been due to low production and part may have been blair making a big profit on them steve davis later had these analyzed and was selling a product he said was essentially the same for about  of the price blair was getting not  less but  that is  less at the time blair was selling his i dont think there was any other such product on the market so his were the only option they did work well even a few a day seemed to help your general well being  next time blairs dietary guidelines for nathans program contact me home page   copyright   charles

basically it was a lipotropic fat loss product this product was mentioned in pumping iron the book as is blairs protein both on page  with mike katz and ed corney using it todays substitute would just be choline and inositol capsules probably separate in order to achieve the  ratio it is a weight loss product the way he used it i think rheo also used the amino acid methionine with students needing to take off fat if he was around today i expect he would also be using lcarnitine or the acetyl lcarntine and probably conjugated linoleic acid for students needing to lose weight iocen this was a liquid iodine product made from dulse one would take a few drops on alternate days and it would provide in his estimation all the iodine you would need softone this was nothing but blond psyllium husks a bulk fiber product about the same as metamucil blair had students use it if they had any elimination problems as a result of his program which was obviously low in fiber blairs calcium plus and calcium pf phosphorus free these two calcium products the only difference being one contained phosphorus and the other did not were superior to others on the market in their day at that time most calcium products you would see were calcium carbonate tablets which were very difficult to digest and assimilate blairs was in capsule form and consisted of calcium citrate lactate gluconate and carbonate they also contained vitamin d and some hcl to help them be easily digested in case you were wondering hcl in its dry form doesnt digest anything until dissolves in liquid such as in the stomach which is why it did not digest the capsules while still in the bottle calcium carbonate is and always was the cheapest and least bioavailable form so it is generally inferior to the other forms it makes a good antacid as it takes so much stomach acid to digest blairs magnesium blair was using magnesium aspartate when all the other formulas were the very inferior magnesium oxide today magnesium asparate citrate and orotate are available and are all good forms you can find them combined with the calcium in many formulas blairs zinc  i dont have notes on this one but i think he was using either citrate or picolinate again when everyone else was offering the cheaper and less assimible oxide form the three minerals listed are here are those blair considered most important in particular the calcium he had students using these often without having them use the other minerals such as his iron plus product all in all though these products were ahead of their time blairs amino acid capsules these were famous many top bodybuilders used these particularly when they were on restricted diets and trying to get cut for contests my understanding is that blair had these formulated to his specifications which was with the profile of whole eggs that is the aminos would be in the same proportions as they would occur in eggs they were expensive around  per  in the early s i think the peak price on them later was around  each and that was during a time frame when money was worth more than it is now part of this high price may have been due to low production and part may have been blair making a big profit on them steve davis later had these analyzed and was selling a product he said was essentially the same for about  of the price blair was getting not  less but  that is  less at the time blair was selling his i dont think there was any other such product on the market so his were the only option they did work well even a few a day seemed to help your general well

click here to visit our page a conversation about rheo blair part ii  nathans experience in part i of our conversation about his experience with rheo blair we met nathan a distance student of rheo blairs back in the s s and s we learned how he heard about rheo and of his initial modest blair programhe had tried other lines weider hoffman etc but eventually chose blairs we learn why and we learn of his second more intense blair program including his views on some of blairs products  charles lets clarify what the issues were in your mind at that time regarding the choice between the weider products and the blair products you say that weider claimed superiority for his products nathan yes certain nonblair products were so highly touted in the magazines of protein manufacturers not only in ads but in text that an impressionable kid had to believe they were the best by them being touted in text what i mean is that most articles about a successful bodybuilder of the time would often include that bodybuilder testifying that he owed much of his success to for example weider products initially they tasted awful but as time went on with more sugar added they tasted better  but at what cost to nutritional quality i recall a product named “super pro ” a canned liquid product which listed as its first ingredient corn syrup i liked the vanilla flavor but the  grams of protein later they claimed as much as  derived from it was at the expense of one having to also ingest a lot of empty and harmful sugar calories another one i remember well was “crash weight  “ i believe it was made of confectionery sugar flavoring and casein claims for it were up to a pound a day of weight gain but even though i mixed it with things like ice cream bananas pineapple raw eggs and lots of milk i still did not gain much weight on it probably just as well because if i had gained weight it would have probably been mostly fat charles so youre saying there was lots of sugar empty calories and not much in the way of results those are words no one would ever use about rheo blair and didnt weider also sell protein tablets nathan yes and here we go again weiders protein tablets consisted of i think soy protein probably some sugar and flavoring those did have bromelain in them to assist with digestion but i am not sure if there was actually enough to do much good at least for me on the other hand weiders bdbu break downbuild up was a fairly good product which included bioflavanoids and vitamin c and everyone at that time sold the ascorbic acid form of vitamin c since the more exotic versions like  ester c and some mineral bound forms of c were not yet available  but with most other ingredients blair chose the best quality ingredients at the highest therapeutic level per serving regardless of cost and no sugar ever let me give you an example if calcium carbonate was cheap and calcium citrate expensive  blair would choose the calcium citrate at a high dose level while the others might chose the carbonate at a lower dose level while still charging a high price so regardless of your outofpocket cost blairs was always the better value and most important of all  you got results blairs commitment to results also extended to the form in which the supplement came he chose for example  the more expensive and more bioavailable capsule format whenever availablepossible while others defaulted to the cheaper tablet format which did not always break down or at least did not do so consistently   and lets get back to the core ingredients the protein powders weider and others sold were soybased which is bad enough but it was also grainy and hard to mix adding insult to injury this was where blairs milk and egg protein was so clearly superior  far more nutritious and easier to assimilate of course but also easier to mix and better tasting particularly with the esther based flavorings he sold to clarify blair himself initially sold a soy powder product and was quickly copied and outmarketed by others but blair always was looking for better nutritional options for himself and his clients therefore when he found out that soy had real problems with indigestibility and was an incomplete protein and therefore an unbalanced amino acid profile he quickly dumped soy in favor of milk and egg  had he known soy was a goitrogen he probably would have dumped it sooner as goitrogens can in those with thyroid issues disrupt the entire hormonal balance of the body that very balance being at the core of blair’s successful theories and results charles you are too polite about the taste of the nonblair powders i tried several of them in the mids before i had heard of rheo blair those powders tasted vile and they didn’t help me  although i held my nose and drank them religiously i didnt gain a pound but when i tried blairs i couldnt believe how incredibly good it tasted blairs protein was literally so tasty that it was like something that should be bad for you –but it wasn’t  and how they worked before and after magic  bottom line you can’t build a healthy body with sugar and soy  raw organic milk and raw organic eggs do build healthy bodies just ask weston price    nathan yes my results were certainly not spectacular on the weider products either the taste was clearly inferior and bottom line the bodybuilders in many cases were not even using them in spite of the fact they appeared in paid advertisements for those same products amazing  incidentally i once had a problem with  the weider company when it took around  months to receive a weight training bench which was paid for in advance it was a lot more difficult in those days to get any consumer protection and the thing was paid for by check so nothing like charging back a credit card the “weider research institute” as near as anyone can tell existed in name only although i did not know that at the time  charles rheo didnt always get his orders shipped out promptly god knows but it was never anything like  months and he did do his best with all that was going on around him we used to joke about everyone at blair house being on blair time where the world moved at a more relaxed pace and things just didnt happen in the most efficient manner possible to the casual observer this was something of an illusion truth was he and his staff were constantly very busy and accomplished more than the average person could ever imagine nathan well my switch from weider to blair products was somewhat gradual trying and comparing them to the locally available and less expensive lines i do wish there had been a local blair dealer as i could get the others products nearby and quickly blair products were to be found on the west coast in health food stores but that was not the case in small towns here on the east coast   and as i started to get to know a few of the serious bodybuilders i learned that many of them  especially if they were drug free preferred blairs products to all others and almost no one had much respect for most other products lines other than those with some commercial interest in them such as the store selling them and then it is also true that some guys i knew by the s were steroid users and basically had found that they gained no matter what so they were not all that particular about what supplements they used charles rheo called these latter the easy gainers and said they could eat practically anything and get big but rheo made his mark turning hard gainers into successful bodybuilders over time  and taking easy gainers and doing the same practically overnight  and of course the steroid question is of huge significance and covered thoroughly by randy roach nathan in my case though determined to remain drug free i felt i should be using the best and while the change was gradual by  i had finally dumped weider and was totally on blairs also when i started earning more money around  and blair assured me his program would get results thats the way i went after many years on various other products with gradual almost indifferent results  i finally got the best most dramatic and impressive results ever from blairs big program charles ok so shifting away from nonblair products lets focus on your big blair program  tell us what happened and this was how long after your first modest blair program in   nathan well several years fast forward through a late s stage of being more interested in things like bob dylan music subculture and beautiful hippie girls with long straight hair even longer than my own shoulder length hair to the early s when i went back to the weights it was not because i needed to but because it was something i missed once i was back in the workaday world and had a full time adult type job i decided that i could afford the blair program and once again contacted rheocharles was he happy to hear from you and happy that you were ready to go big      nathan yes rheo was very happy that i wanted to get serious both about bodybuilding and about doing his big program and wanted me to come to hollywood california for a stay at blair house  while that woud have been by far the best option i had too many commitments to honor rather than go to california for a stay and reasoned that  the money that would have gone for airfare etc could instead be used for more supplements so i never went i wish i had though because i learned years later about some of the things he did there such as hydrotherapy massage therapy etc charles yes there were huge advantages in the results column of living with him during ones program  nathan and yet even at the higher level i was on my participation was still limited by limited funds and at  dollars per month i was still not on some of the more elite products and on limited doses of others i was able to use good amounts of the extra special protein at what was then lb lots of his very unique soybro liver extract lecithin hcl and bcomplex rheo would give me advice on both on how to use these products and advice on training he was always very cordial and helpful   however if rheo did have had a fault  it was that he either could not or would not recognize that i did not have unlimited financial resources  and yet i was spending a fortune at the time what i was spending with him was literally as much as some people in north carolina my home at that time were earning my rheo bill was more than my house payment and car payment combined and still he wanted me to spend more   charles that sounds like rheo i knew all right he was  dedicated to everyone getting the best results but yes his program was very costly and his special private products were both extremely costly to produce and virtually impossible to get anywhere else but for those who had the resources to buy them and use them at the levels rheo advised  the results were practically unbelieveable this is a big reason he went after the hollywood celebrity crowd lots of money to spend in pursuit of dramatic results and for rheo lots of priceless free publicity when they did  nathan all of that aside and despite my limited resources this big program was very effective for me  i was already a somewhat advanced trainee and i gained probably another  lbs of muscle  in the first  months  not only did i look better but i also felt better on the blair program felt like there was no stress in my life despite the fact that nothing in my life had changed to cause this other than my being on the blair program  charles one reason for this is that his program helped support and strengthen the adrenal glands those endocrines that deal with stress adrenal fatigue a result of too much stress is a big problem for many people it sounds like his program helped you in that regard but theres another point regarding stress and the blair program rheo taught that a certain frame of mind was required  for the best good bodybuilding results peace and tranquility why because that state of mind allowed for increased blood flow and thus more nutrients reached the tissues that needed feeding for growth nathan not only did i look and feel better but my skin tone improved my energy was up and there was no longer any shaking when i worked out even on the final tough reps of a set  from that point on i always ordered blairs at whatever level i could afford very expensive but worth every penny from my experience and so i can say that after many years on various other products with indifferent results i got the best results ever from blairs big program results eventually tapered off that kind of muscle gain cannot be maintained long term  but cash was ultimately the limting factor and i had to eventually give up the big program i continued however to use rheos products until he died and even after that got them as long as they were available from his office manager frederick lindblad when freddie no longer had access to any blair products i began trying to replicate the program with other products some could be replaced some could not soybro was the one item i never found much of a replacement for others were on again off again some company would start making a product i thought was similar to blairs then often stop making it probably due to lack of market interest or high cost charles tell us about your dietary regime while on the big program  nathan first of all rheos program at least for people like me who were lean and interested in bodybuilding was high protein high fat low carb for those who needed to lose weight my understanding is that it was still high protein low carb but perhaps not as much fat allowed rheo would probably have had bodybuilders like myself practically live off of his protein mixed with half and half as a protein shake or made into a pudding with heavy cream taken maybe  times per day along with digestants and other supplements but for the moment the question you asked is about food rheo was very much against sugar or anything like sugar he told me that things like dextrose maltodextrose maltodextrins corn syrup etc were really just other forms of sugar and were to be avoided he even felt that one should avoid honey and fruit juices which tended to elevate blood sugar he singled out ketchup i remember saying that most brands were over  sugar he felt that salt need never be added to food that enough sodium would occur naturally charles i wonder if unrefined sea salt celtic sea salt himalayan pink salt etc were available at that time these are superb trace mineral sources unlike refined white table salt which is toxic nathan foods he specifically thought were good were cottage cheese if you werent overweight you could have peaches or pineapple with it but only in its natural fruit juice never in any kind of syrup beef steaks but not too much meat as it would throw your phosphorus to calcium ratio out of balance which was bad for your nervous system this phosphoruscalcium thing i have never quite understood but he obviously did potatoes were also fine if you werent overweight carbs in general were to be limited but when you did have carbs they had to be complex carbs not simple carbs at one time when i was training heavy with the weights he had me eating steak and potatoes for breakfast eggs were allowed almost any time from raw to scrambled to soft cooked not boiled low temp soft cooked in the shell he was very big on eggs and they were his choice as the food nearest to perfect hard cheeses were generally ok too he preferred to get everything in natural unpasteurized organic form when possible raw milk cream and cheese beef raised with no drugs or hormones grass fed etc about the only thing i know of rheo allowing that was artificial was the use of saccharin in his ice cream which was made in an ice cream churn with milk cream blairs protein and flavoring eggs were used in the french vanilla version of that ice cream  i later learned from freddie that rheo was very much against commercially available ice cream seems that it not only had loads of sugar but lots of chemicals too some of which through some loophole the manufacturers were not required to put on the label low carb salads were allowed but not near the time protein supplements were taken as the salad would interfere with digestion of the protein  i dont know if any of rheos thoughts would be different now that we know more about glycemic indexes and insulin indexes as an example we now know that sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index level than white potatoes i do not know if he would therefore be recommending sweet potatoes we can only speculate on that one thing i do know is that the human body has not undergone a radical change in just a generation or two so what rheo was practicing in the s and s will still work now at least for the same percentage of people it worked for then  and that was most people  one critical key to understanding his philosophy was his attempt to achieve a steroid like effect by the extremely high doses of all of the bcomplex he used he also stressed that the various parts of his program were designed to work synergistically and therefore would be much less effective if someone tried to pick and choose from the products in his line  in a broader sense  rheo taught me to study and think about nutrition from a scientific standpoint he emphasized the orthomolecular aspects of nutrition of working with the cell in mind i learned to place value on having a diet adequate in complete protein sources i know the importance of proper digestion and using digestants and of the critical roles of the  the b and c vitamins and of course the utility of small frequent meals in place of large less frequent ones  charles what advice did he have for you with regards to exercise nathan well one basic piece of advice he gave me  and which i did not heed and wish that i had  was to exercise less even when i explained to him that i was serious about bodybuilding and not just general health he said i should only train  minutes or so  times a week he did not recommend training to failure or limit either as he said that resulted in training on nervous energy  his term he also told me not to do barbell squats i understand that this may have had something to do with the endocrine system but the surface reason he gave me was that squats will develop squatters thigh which does not look very good it wasnt until years later that i understood what he was talking about that squats do build legs but legs that resemble tree stumps and have little shape or aesthetic appeal as far as the amount of training goes i now know that i was grossly absurdly overtraining especially in volume but sometimes in intensity as well charles as we approach the end of this conversation nathan lets return to the blair products and what you liked about them nathan what i liked about blair products aside from the fact that they were far more effective is basically the opposite of what i did not like about weider all of the blair products except for the regular vitamin c were in capsule form and easy to swallow the germ oil product soybro was a soft gel so no bad taste or texture  the capsule and soft gel forms were also more likely to be assimilated versus a hard compressed pill which might go through the system without the nutrients being released the protein powder was easy to mix and stayed pretty well suspended in the shake less settling when i started dealing with blair he was already selling the milk and egg protein no longer the soy which he had sold earlier so that might account for the easier mixing one other thing about blair was that if you wanted to use a large number of capsules of something such as liver extract or soybro he offered up to  capsule sizes at a discount when compared with buying many small bottles charles would you like to single out and comment on one or more specific products that you found especially effective nathan soybro was certainly a favorite which i have never been able to replace a company called enzymatic therapy made something they called sterolplex for a while which was similar but generally there has been nothing like soybro it had the heavy lipids removed thus allowing the uptake of the complex sterols in large amounts without consuming huge amounts of difficult to digest fat which occurred in the raw oils if you took  or more soybro a day especially if you were also taking large amounts of liver extract you experienced a general feeling of well being blairs extra special protein has never quite been duplicated it was the most effective even though i liked the regular blairs protein taste wise one product that should be mentioned to anyone trying to duplicate blairs program as seen here was softone this was a high grade psyllium husk product it was inexpensive but actually fairly important to the program or at least to the program i was on as i got very little fiber when consuming just the dairy products and meat psyllium and similar products are readily available of course but my favorite blair products in order and with some consideration as to how difficult they were to duplicate elsewhere would be soybro protein regular or special liver extract and calcium pf charles nathan its been
