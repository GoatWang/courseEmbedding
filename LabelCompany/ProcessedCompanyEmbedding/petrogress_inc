evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of products and services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured the company recognizes revenue during the month in which commissions are earned   fair value of financial instruments   fair value measurements are determined under a threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity “observable inputs” and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances “unobservable inputs” fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value the company primarily uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets “market approach” the company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly   the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement   the three hierarchy levels are defined as follows   level   quoted prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   level   quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly   level   prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value the methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments but incorporates the company’s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market          the companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash accounts receivable inventory marketable securities accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible debt the carrying amount of the company’s accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date based on quoted prices which

accordance with asc  equitybased payments to nonemployees the measurement date is the earlier of  the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or  the date at which the counterpartys performance is complete stock awards granted to nonemployees are valued at their respective measurement dates based on the trading price of the company’s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services are provided   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period actual results could differ from those estimates          income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future tax effects calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization the company records a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment   asc  prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition issues the company classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses to date the company has not been assessed nor has the company paid any interest or penalties   the company measures and records uncertain tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

an embedded derivative since the notes are convertible into a variable number of shares upon conversion accordingly the mammoth notes were not considered to be conventional debt under eitf  and the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability accordingly the fair value of these derivative instruments being recorded as a liability on

that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible due to the uncertainty of the company’s ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance at september     note   commitments and contingencies   the company is not a party to any litigation and to its knowledge no action suit or
