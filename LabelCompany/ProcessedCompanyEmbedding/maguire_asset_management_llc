prose and therefore should not be relied on for grammatical accuracy this is not a verbatim transcript parts have been slightly modified to improve readability berkeley capital partners is a registered investment advisor in atlanta georgia chris eddy cfp® partner investment officer berkeley capital partners tony palazzo cfa berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but if you do i think with the way the industry’s changing you should look into it and you should

process maguire asset management urges ctpartners to immediately commence robust sale process believes the company is worth between  and  per share to a buyerbelieves the board has a fiduciary duty to engage with dhr international to determine maximum offer value mar    et from maguire asset management llc laguna beach calif march   prnewswire  maguire asset management a significant shareholder of ctpartners executive search inc ctpartners or the company nysemkt ctp today announced that it has delivered a letter to the companys board of directors demanding the initiation of a wellorchestrated sale process and the immediate appointment of new independent board members the full text of the letter follows march   members of the board of directorsctpartners executive search inc avenue of the americasrd floornew york ny  dear board members maguire asset management llc is a significant shareholder of ctpartners  by way of a brief background maguire asset management is a valueoriented investor that seeks to take a substantial ownership position in a limited number of undervalued companies that we believe can meaningfully benefit from our active engagement  our approach is to work constructively with management and the board of directors to help implement strategies that can vastly increase returns for all shareholders  our investment managers and affiliated operating executives have significantly enhanced value at numerous companies through a combination of corporate governance improvements disciplined mergers and acquisitions organizational restructurings enhanced operational efficiencies and more effective capital allocation   we firmly believe ctpartners is a company that can benefit greatly from our help  as you know the past several months of the companys history has been turbulent for shareholders who have experienced a precipitous decline in share value ranging from a high of more than  per share in november  to a low of  per share in late january   and while the stock price has rebounded slightly mainly supported by dhr internationals  per share offer on february  there remains an ongoing overhang of investor skepticism and uncertainty about the companys ability to rebound completely as a standalone enterprise  undervaluation in the public market based on a series of poor management decisions reported allegations of inappropriate management behavior and a number of outside factors it is our opinion that ctpartners is significantly undervalued in the public market  this is not something entirely unique to ctpartners but relatively commonplace among microcap companies where loss of leadership credibility among investors in combination with small daily trading volumes and limited research coverage lead to ongoing undervaluation in the market  this situation is particularly acute for ctpartners and in our opinion is best rectified by the addition of shareholder representatives to the board immediately to help restore investor confidence in good corporate governance and the genuine examination of strategic alternatives led by truly independent and experienced board members significant value to a buyer today rather than attempt to resuscitate investor confidence over the next several quarters and perhaps years we believe that you as directors will better fulfill your fiduciary duty to all shareholders by exploring a sale of the entire company  ctpartners has attractive prospects to a strategic buyer within a rapidly growing industry a healthy ma environment and clear interest from strategic buyers suggest an attractive premium could be achieved through a wellorchestrated sale process  based upon our detailed analysis of ctpartners and the trading value of its competitors we believe the company could be sold to a strategic buyer for a price between  and  per share engage with dhr international as part of a robust sale process we believe that public company directors have an obligation to seriously examine credible offers unsolicited or otherwise  dhr international is one of the largest retained executive search firms in the world with a solid reputation within the industry  on february  dhr submitted an offer of  per share for all of the outstanding equity in the company it does not own  on february  the company announced that the board had formed a special committee to review strategic alternatives including dhrs bid  on march  following what we can only presume was a lack of meaningful engagement on your behalf dhr nominated a slate of six highlyqualified candidates for election to the board  on the same day the company announced the termination of its ceo and his replacement by the companys vice chairman in our opinion the best way to maximize shareholder value in situations like this is to engage dhr as one of many potential bidders in a wellrun auction process  this will level the playing field between dhr and other participants and reassure shareholders that the board is indeed acting in their best interests  we are prepared to propose several respected and highlyqualified board candidates to help oversee this process on behalf of all shareholders finally the company has announced management will report its results for the fourth quarter of  on tuesday march   we request that you update shareholders at that time as to the depth of the strategic alternatives review and the process being run by the board the directive given to robert w baird  the special committees financial advisor eg does it include a full auction process and the anticipated timeline to completion to reiterate we believe the board and management have lost credibility with wall street and investors alike  in times like this effective stakeholder communications and full transparency and engagement are critical  we look forward to speaking with you soon sincerely tim maguire investor contacttim maguire   source maguire asset management llc view

conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were
