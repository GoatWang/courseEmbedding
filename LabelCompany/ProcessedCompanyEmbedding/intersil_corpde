further information regarding risks and uncertainties see item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k overview we design and develop innovative power management and precision analog integrated circuits or ics we were formed in august  when we acquired the semiconductor business of harris corporation and began operating as intersil corporation that semiconductor business included product portfolios and intellectual property dating back to  when semiconductor companies were just emerging in silicon valley we are now an established supplier of power management and precision analog technology for many of the most rigorous applications in the computing consumer and industrial markets we supply a full range of power ic solutions for battery management processor power management and display power management including power regulators converters and controllers as well as fully integrated power modules we also provide precision analog components such as

for  was  million a decrease of  million or  from  in aggregate lower overall unit sales in  and a decrease in average selling prices or asps for the related product mix decreased revenue by  million and  million respectively as compared to  revenue during the year was impacted by overall weakness in the demand environment arising from sluggish global economic growth industrial  infrastructure

primarily due to introduction and sale of new products with higher average gross margins our gross margin increased by  basis points in  from  the increase was primarily due to a higher mix of revenue from the industrial  infrastructure endmarket generally our computing  consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial  infrastructure products we strive to improve gross margins from their present levels by introducing new highmargin products and effecting cost saving opportunities in our manufacturing chain operating costs and expenses research and development rd our rd expenses increased by  or  million to  million in  compared to  million in  primarily as a result of variable compensation expense of  million and higher equitybased compensation expense of  million in  offset by lower payroll and related costs from lower headcount our rd expenses increased by  or  million to  million in  compared to  million in  primarily as a result of higher equitybased compensation offset by lower variable compensation expense in  we believe that a continued commitment to rd is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in rd as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies our mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming more complex and expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total rd expenses selling general and administrative sga our sga expenses decreased by  or  million to  million in  compared

consolidated certain offices our sga expenses decreased by  or  million to  million in  compared to  million in  primarily as a result of lower variable compensation expense and outside legal expenses during  the outside legal expenses had been higher due to activity related to the taos litigation amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles was  million in   million in  and  million in  the decreases in  from  and in  from  were primarily the result of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year ended december   offset by amortization of intangibles related to the gws acquisition table of contents restructuring and related costs on june   we began implementation of a plan to decommission our  millimeter wafer fabrication line in palm bay florida or the mm line the investment in the mm line was made approximately four years ago to address the need to extend the production life of certain products manufactured at a third party wafer foundry when the supply commitments from the supplier for these products were set to expire at the end of  in july  the supplier was acquired and the acquirer recently decided to continue longterm support for the manufacturing of these products to avoid the future capital investment anticipated to be required for the mm line we determined it would be beneficial to our longterm cost structure to source the manufacturing for these products from this supplier and decommission our mm line due to this shift in manufacturing to an outside provider we recorded an impairment charge of  million during the quarter ended july   on these longlived assets related to the mm line the impairment charge was calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets fair value was determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved we also recorded impairment charges of  million during the quarter ended july   for specific inventory items related to the mm line which had no alternative use during the quarter ended december   we completed the sale of the longlived assets related to the mm line for  million and recognized the related gain of  million as an offset to the restructuring and related costs of  million recorded during the quarter ended july   resulting in a net restructuring and related costs charge of  million for the year ended december   in addition we recorded  million of severance and other employee benefit costs related to the decommissioning and other cost reduction actions during  as of december   there was  million of accrued liabilities related to these actions which was paid during the first quarter of  provision for export compliance settlement we recorded a provision of  million in  related to amounts due under the consent agreement we entered into with the dtcc to settle claims of alleged violations of itar provision for the taos litigation texas advanced optoelectronic solutions inc or taos named us as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on november   in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas in this action taos alleged four claims consisting of patent infringement breach of contract trade secret misappropriation and tortious interference with a business relationship on march   the jury found in favor of taos on each of the four claims after certain posttrial motions were heard the court entered a final judgment on june   against us in the amount of  million plus court costs and a continuing royalty on certain products found to be infringing taos patent on june   we filed a notice of appeal taos filed a notice of crossappeal our opening brief was filed in october  and the matter continues to progress as a consequence of the jurys verdict during the quarter ended april   we recorded a provision of  million related to this matter including prejudgment interest and estimated legal costs as a result of the entry of the june   judgment we increased our accrual for this matter by  million in the quarter ended july   given the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation and because the outcome remains subject to appeal the ultimate impact of this lawsuit may be materially different from our estimate mergerrelated expenses we recorded transactionrelated costs of  million principally for outside financial advisory legal and related fees and expenses associated with the pending acquisition with renesas in the year ended december   additional transactionrelated costs are expected to be incurred through the closing of the merger table of contents other income and expenses interest expense and other during  upon liquidation of a

our income tax expense was  million for  compared to an income tax benefit of  million in  income tax for  included a  million benefit relating to release of certain united states federal and state unrecognized tax benefits or utbs due to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation the effective tax rate differs from the  statutory corporate tax rate primary due to this utb reserve release and due to losses sustained in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates as a global company our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities our effective tax rate as well as our actual taxes payable could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates our primary foreign operations are in malaysia where we currently have a tax holiday resulting in a tax rate of  this tax holiday began on july   and terminates on july   in order to retain this holiday in malaysia we must meet certain operating conditions including compliance with warehouse and shipping quotas and specified manufacturing activities in malaysia absent such tax incentives the corporate income tax rate in malaysia that would otherwise apply to us would be  if we cannot or elect not to comply with these conditions we could lose the related tax benefits in such event we may be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangement the impact of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of  million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of  in  compared to an expense of  million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of  in  and compared to a benefit of  million and a decrease on the effective tax rate of  for  in determining net loss income we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we do not believe that the recovery is likely we establish a valuation allowance as of december   our net deferred tax amounted to  million compared to  million as of january   applicable guidance requires us to record our tax expense based on various estimates of probabilities of sustaining certain tax positions as a result of this and other factors our income tax expense could be volatile which contributes to volatility in reported financial results as of december   and january   our gross utbs related to uncertain tax positions were  million and  million respectively as of december    million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries due to

our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property as of december   our net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were  million of which  million are classified as longterm liabilities and  million are netted against deferred tax assets at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the payments if any in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits as a result these amounts are not included in the table above offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulation sk item aii liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements
