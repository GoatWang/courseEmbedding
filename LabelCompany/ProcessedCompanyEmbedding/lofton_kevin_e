reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit hilary swiftthe new york times this interview with kevin e lofton chief executive of catholic health initiatives was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq were you in leadership roles when you were youngera a lot of what i learned from an early age was around influence i was involved in a lot of things i ran track in high school and i also played piano and competitive chess i think people generally always looked at me as a leader and i felt like i was having influence people wanted to know what i had to sayi didn’t have a lot of formal leadership positions though i was class vice president in my sophomore year of high school during the same year that supreme court justice sonia sotomayor was the class presidenttell me about your parentsmy father was an electrician he worked two jobs when we were young my mom was a dental assistant during most of my years growing up she later went back to school and became a dental hygienist continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story my grandmother in texas was a big influence on us too she was a domestic but she was a fighter needless to say it was segregated down in texas at the time and the street my grandparents lived on when i was little still had ditches my grandmother led the civic effort to get the streets pavedanother influential person was the dentist my mother worked for he treated us like we were his children and a lot of the exposure that i got to things at an early age came through his influence his wife for instance was a bass cellist in the symphony orchestra and we would go to concerts at lincoln center he actually paid for me to go to the music school that his children were in we played in carnegie hall and new york world’s fairwhat was your first management rolemy first hospital job was as an emergency department administrator in jacksonville fla at the time it was the seventhbusiest emergency department in the country i was probably  and straight out of grad school i had a staff of about  peoplethat’s a big jump how did you handle iti realized that a big part of my job was to help people see the ultimate value of the job they do it was also about looking at what needed to be done and not accepting any excuses this was a county hospital the kind of place where sometimes people accept mediocrity i moved up rapidly because i didn’t accept that and i got things doneat the end of the day people really want to do the right thing i saw my job as removing barriers and then celebrating successes i also brought people into the process when you bring staff into a meeting and you talk to them about the things we can do to improve and then you actually act on their ideas and they see that their input made a difference people will follow you newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email

a b and c here’s the way you can help with that what suggestions do you have to make it better those are the secrets to success advertisement continue reading the main story were you ever nervous about all that responsibility at such a young agean early mentor of mine said something to me when i was going to a new job “don’t worry it’s just another dog and pony show” that really stayed with me when you’re taking on another new challenge you just take a couple of deep breaths and say “you can do this it’s just another dog and pony show”what’s unusual about the culture of your current companyin our senior management meetings we appoint a designated devil’s advocate as we call it so if we’re discussing a critical issue we’ll appoint someone — and the role rotates — to be the devil’s advocate no matter what their personal point of view is that helps you avoid groupthinkhow do you hirei start with the “why” — why are you here why would this role fit into your career path and why are you interested in coming to our organization i then focus on the “what” — what are the things that you’ve done that relate to what you might do here and what are your ideas for how you can help usand then i move to the “how” and that’s where character comes in how do you do business somebody might be a cardiovascular surgeon who is going to put a lot of money on our bottom line but if they yell at nurses in the operating room then we don’t want themwhat kind of advice do you give to new college gradsi give a lot of talks to students and i usually close the sessions with this advice they should take a blank sheet of paper and an envelope write down a goal of something that they want to do over the coming year then seal it nobody’s ever going to see this except you i tell them — it’s not for your teachers it’s not for your parents it’s just for yourselfthen a year later you take it out and grade yourself on whether you worked toward that goal and then you set a new goal for the next year it’s really just to get them in the habit of looking at the things they need to work on setting a personal goal and then seeing how they’ve done against that goal i still do this myself
