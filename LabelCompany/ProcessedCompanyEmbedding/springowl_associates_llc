weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

springowl asset management expresses concerns over om group inc sale agreement requests more thorough disclosure and scrutiny of omgs sale process jun    et from springowl asset management llc new york june   prnewswire  springowl asset management llc and its affiliate funds springowl are shareholders of om group inc omg or the company  and have spent considerable time and resources analyzing the company and coming to the view that omgs common stock trades at undervalued levels and offers tremendous potential upside to patient longterm investors  springowl has reviewed the june   press release issued by omg announcing that the company had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of affiliates of apollo global management llc and platform specialty products corporation together the apollo parties at a price of share this price represents only an approximate  premium to omgs immediately prior closing price on may   an approximate  premium to omgs week high an approximate  discount to omgs fiveyear high and a greater than  discount to omgs alltime high springowl believes that omg is on the verge of moving past a number of selfinflicted operational issues including i a valuedestructive ma binge at a cost of approximately  billion ii woeful historical roic and roe measures versus the companys proxy peer group over one three and fiveyear periods iii lackluster ebitda margins as compared to the companys proxy peer group and iv a seemingly bloated sga structure it appears that the board did not engage alternative buyers for the company given the closetotrough levels of the companys stock as well as the boards historic friendliness with management which led to a less than favorable sayonpay vote in   we cannot help questioning whether the sale process was structured to maximize value to omg shareholders or instead to favor the companys management team through an ongoing partnership with the apollo parties  springowls analysis notes that the proposed transaction is all cash squeezing out public shareholders from all benefits of omgs future growth and value creation from its vast array of businesses  notably platform has publicly referred to the enormous synergies it expects to reap from the transaction synergies in which omg shareholders will not have the opportunity to participate accordingly springowl requests more thorough disclosure and the application of greater scrutiny to the sales process to ensure that the process was not designed to favor the buying group at the expense of shareholders further it is highly troubling to springowl that this sale agreement apparently was entered into prior to the seating of the two nominees of frontfour capital group that omg agreed as part of a recent settlement to place on omgs managementbacked board slate for the upcoming annual meeting  we also note with interest that the board includes a former partner of the principals of apollo from when they were all working at drexel burnham lambert  we are troubled by an appearance of a potentially clubby atmosphere in which shareholder interests were not necessarily prioritized  we note that in january  frontfour estimated the per share value of omg pending implementation of their proposed plan to be approximately  per share a greater than  premium to the  per share price in the proposed transaction  given the companys decision to place the frontfour nominees on the slate we question why omg would enter an agreement to sell itself at this exorbitant discount to frontfours value estimate prior to the seating of these nominees andrew m wallach managing member of springowl stated we purchased omg intending to be long term participants in what we believe will be substantial value realization by the company  we have real questions about a process that seems to have been geared to a single buyer in the absence of competition  mr wallach added we believe that appropriate measures for fair change of control value are determined by assessing net present value of discounted cash flows andor valuation multiples of prospective cash flows and we encourage greater disclosure of the boards methodology in supporting a seemingly lowball price for our company springowls policy is to view any socalled deal protections which impede higher and better offers providing greater value to omg shareholders with great suspicion  this is especially so when there is legacy management continuation or sizable severance payouts  limited windows for superior offers and breakup fees are examples of such deal protections that may not serve selling shareholders well and require great scrutiny important information springowl associates llc the adviser a new york limited liability company commenced operations

requests more thorough disclosure and scrutiny of dfcs sale process apr    et from springowl associates llc new york april   prnewswire  springowl asset management llc and its affiliate funds springowl own  shares representing approximately  of the outstanding common stock of dfc global corp dfc or the company and we intend to acquire additional shares subject to market prices having spent considerable time and resources to come to the view that dfcs common stock trades at undervalued levels and offers tremendous potential upside to patient longterm investors  springowl has reviewed the april   press release issued by dfc announcing that the company had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by lone star funds at a price of share representing an absurdly low lessthan  premium to last nights closing price and a  discount to dfcs week high stock price springowl believes that dfc is on the verge of moving past its uk regulatory issues having had multiple conversations with management in which management affirmed that view  as it appears that the special committee did not engage alternative buyers for the company and given i the almost trough levels of the companys stock and ii the boards historic friendliness with management iss recommended that shareholders vote against the companys sayonpay resolution at its november  annual meeting as a result of ceo equity awards which they believed created a misalignment with shareholders we cannot help questioning whether the sale process was structured to maximize value to dfc shareholders or instead to favor the companys management team through a partnership with lone star  springowls analysis notes that the proposed transaction is all cash squeezing out public shareholders from all benefits of dfcs future growth and value creation from its vast alternative lending network accordingly springowl requests more thorough disclosure and the application of greater scrutiny of the sales process to ensure that the process was not designed to favor any particular buying group we also note that dfc issued a press release this morning which conveniently lowered its  guidance  given the discretion involved in such guidance springowl seeks further explanation of whether this guidance reduction was in any way meant to justify the appallingly low price at which the ceos handpicked board agreed to sell this company jason ader chief investment officer of springowl stated we purchased dfc intending to be long term participants in what we believe will be substantial value realization by the company  we have real questions about a process that seems to have been geared to a single buyer in the absence of competition andrew wallach portfolio manager of springowl added we believe that appropriate measures for fair change of control value are determined by assessing net present value of discounted cash flows andor valuation multiples of prospective cash flows and we encourage greater disclosure of the boards methodology in supporting a seemingly lowball offer for our company springowls policy is to view any socalled deal protections which impede higher and better offers providing greater value to dfc shareholders with great suspicion  this is especially so when there is legacy management continuation or sizable severance payouts  limited windows for superior offers and breakup fees are examples of such deal protections that may not serve selling shareholders well and require great scrutiny important informationspringowl associates llc the adviser a new york limited liability company
