by inflammation in the eye macular edema is the most dominant cause of vision distortion and loss in uveitis we are developing a treatment for macular edema due to noninfectious uveitis using a suprachoroidal injection of clsta “suprachoroidal clsta” our proprietary preservativefree formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide clsta we have completed an open label phase  and masked randomized phase  trial where we met our primary endpoint showing significant reduction in macular edema p and improvement in best corrected visual acuity p each at  months from baseline we are actively enrolling patients in a month controlled randomized masked multicenter phase  clinical trial and expect to report data in early  based on our endofphase  review with the fda in may  we expect this trial to be the only pivotal clinical trial necessary to support a b nda filing for clsta we believe that clsta will be at least as effective in treating uveitis including the associated macular edema as commonly used local treatments with injected corticosteroids however we believe that there will be improved bioavailability of drug in the retina and choroid which may result in faster onset of therapeutic effect an efficacy profile with similar or lower drug amounts required and longer duration of therapeutic effect potentially resulting in a reduced frequency of necessary injections based on preclinical studies of ocular distribution of ta sparing the anterior portions of the eye including the lens we also believe that clsta may result in fewer side effects compared to commonly used local corticosteroid treatments cls – macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion rvo rvo is a sightthreatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein in our rvo program we are developing a potential treatment where suprachoroidal clsta is used along with intravitreal eylea aflibercept in april  we completed a patient phase  clinical trial with suprachoroidal clsta concomitantly with intravitreal aflibercept in patients with macular edema associated with rvo the study met the primary endpoint with significantly fewer additional intravitreal aflibercept injections in the combination arm compared to the control monotherapy intravitreal aflibercept arm p visual acuity and macular edema improvements were also better in the combination arm compared to the monotherapy arm based on these encouraging positive results and with feedback from a recent q end of phase  review with the fda we have commenced a phase  clinical trial the sapphire study in rvo patients sapphire will enroll approximately  patients randomized  to a combination arm suprachoroidal clsta with intravitreal aflibercept and a control arm monotherapy intravitreal aflibercept with a primary best corrected visual acuity outcome at  weeks   we believe that clsta used along with an antivegf agent may provide a differentiated therapeutic benefit for rvo patients since our combination treatment potentially couples the advantages of visual acuity gain and macular edema reduction along with a quarterly rather than monthly dosing schedule compared to currently used monthly intravitreal antivegf injections alone cls – diabetic macular edema dme we have expanded our clsta development programs to include focusing on treatment for another retinal vascular condition known as diabetic macular edema or dme dme is a common ocular complication of diabetes and is the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetes   in november  we began enrolling patients with dme in an openlabel phase  clinical trial to collect safety data in addition to efficacy observations associated with administering a combination of intravitreal eylea and suprachoroidal clsta or following the administration of suprachoroidal clsta alone in patients with dme over a month evaluation period we expect to enroll approximately  patients in this trial and to report preliminary results in the second half of    we are planning a controlled randomized masked phase  trial where we will compare safety and efficacy outcomes from a combination of suprachoroidal clsta and intravitreal aflibercept to intravitreal aflibercept monotherapy over a ninemonth evaluation period  headquarters  north point parkway suite  alpharetta ga     copyright  clearside biomedical inc custom web design by studio

inc clsd  a latestage biopharmaceutical company developing firstinclass drug therapies to treat backoftheeye diseases today reported financial results for the quarter ended march   and provided an update on its development programs “the clearside team continues our pursuit of transformative elegant precise solutions to restore and preserve vision” said daniel h white chief executive officer and president “together we continued to advance our pipeline in the first quarter of  as our pivotal phase  clinical trial for the treatment of macular edema associated with noninfectious uveitis continues enrollment with preliminary data expected in early   we also enrolled the first patient in a phase  clinical trial for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion additionally we received notices of allowance of two important us patents which are representative of a new family of patents that protect the unique drug distribution properties of injecting to the retinal and choroid through the suprachoroidal space” update on key development programs clsta for suprachoroidal administration “suprachoroidal clsta” clearside’s proprietary suspension formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide used either alone or together with an intravitreal antivegf agent is part of clearside’s pipeline for the treatments of unmet or underserved blinding eye diseases where the pathologies manifest in the choroid and retina macular edema associated with noninfectious uveitis in the first quarter of  clearside continued to enroll patients in peachtree the phase  trial of suprachoroidal clsta in patients with macular edema associated with noninfectious uveitis  clearside currently anticipates that it will report initial results from peachtree in early    macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion “rvo” on february   clearside announced the enrollment of the first patient in a phase  clinical trial sapphire of suprachoroidal clsta used together with intravitreally administered eylea® aflibercept “intravitreal eylea” for the treatment of macular edema associated with rvo sapphire is a multicenter multicountry randomized masked controlled trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal clsta used with intravitreal eylea in subjects with rvo the primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with best corrected visual acuity improvement of at least  letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment several secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will also be evaluated  diabetic macular edema “dme” on april   clearside announced the completion of enrollment in an exploratory clinical trial hulk of suprachoroidal clsta both with or without intravitreal eylea for the treatment of dme hulk is an openlabel multicenter phase  study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the administration of a suprachoroidal injection of clsta along with an intravitreal injection of eylea in patients with dme naïve to treatment as well as that of a suprachoroidal injection of clsta alone in patients with dme who have previously been treated with intravitreal antivegf or intravitreal corticosteroid treatment and still require further treatment  clearside currently expects to report preliminary results from hulk in the second half of  clearside is also planning a multicenter randomized masked controlled phase  trial tybee to evaluate suprachoroidal clsta along with intravitreal eylea compared to intravitreal eylea only in patients with dme over a month evaluation period  the primary endpoint of the trial will be the change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline in the combination treatment arm compared to the intravitreal eylea only arm  clearside currently expects to enroll the first patient in tybee in mid wet agerelated macular degeneration “wet amd” clearside continues to explore potential opportunities for the use of pharmacological therapies via suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of wet amd collaborations as clearside’s development programs move further into the clinic opportunities have been created to collaborate with thirdparty proprietary programs  in this regard clearside continues preclinical efforts with multiple collaborations in gene therapy complement inhibition and alternative mechanisms in the treatment of complex retinal diseases like amd first quarter  financial results clearside’s research and development expenses for the three months ended march   were  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  million this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs related to clearside’s ongoing clinical development programs for clsta and an increase in device manufacturing costs partially offset by the decrease in costs from completed clinical trials and clearside’s discontinuation of preclinical trials in its wet amd program general and administrative expenses were  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the same period last year an increase of  million this yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to an increase of  million in employeerelated costs a  million increase in patent and trademark costs a  million increase for marketing expenses and a  million increase in the costs of operating as a public company  cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled  million as of march   compared to  million as of december   the decrease reflects total operating expenses partially offset by  million received in january  upon the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares as part of clearside’s followon public offering that initially closed in december  net loss for the first quarter of  was  million or  per share of common stock compared to  million or  per share of common stock for the first quarter of   the increase in net loss is primarily attributable to higher research and development expenses while the decrease in net loss per share of common stock is primarily due to an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding resulting from clearside’s financing activities in  conference call  webcast details clearside is pleased to invite all interested parties to participate in a conference call
