joining us on the call before we walk you through the presentation on our website id like to share some thoughts on our business with you we saw strong demand for our brands in our retail and international businesses in the second quarter we achieved our first positive comp in two years at our carters stores and had strong demand online for both carters and oshkosh bgosh demand from domestic consumers was particularly good thankfully were seeing some moderation in the negative effects of the stronger dollar and some signs that international customers are coming back and shopping with us again in the united states higher demand for our brands in canada and china drove the growth in our international sales in the second quarter and domestic wholesale sales were lower than last year but in line with our plan in the second quarter we continued to improve price realization that improvement together with lower product costs drove a higher gross profit margin and funded greater investments in store expansion technology marketing and china startup costs and were reporting good cash flow for the first half which has enabled us to meaningfully increase the return of capital to our shareholders allinall it was a good first half with nearly seven months into the year we have better visibility to the second half weve adjusted our annual sales and earnings plans to reflect our latest outlook on spring  bookings and international demand for our brands understandably some of our wholesale customers are being more conservative with their inventory commitments given trends in their businesses that said were expecting good growth for our company this year our longer term outlook has not changed we believe that our multibrand multichannel business model will enable us to achieve  billion in sales by  with respect to business trends sales ramped up in line with our plan as we moved through the second quarter if you recall we saw our retail trends improve following the easter holiday with positive yeartodate comps through the end of april through yesterday our yeartodate comps have improved on that level of performance were expecting positive comps for the third quarter and second half as we lap up against the volatility in exchange rates and drop in tourism last year our supply chain performance was exceptionally good in the second quarter in terms of ontime deliveries and distribution center efficiencies and inventories are in good shape as we head into the balance of the year the stronger dollar continues to weigh on our results though less so than the previous three quarters as you may recall we began to see the dollar strengthen meaningfully in the second half of last year as the dollar strengthened we saw lower contribution from our canadian operations and a significant decline in international customers shopping with us in the united states on a comparable basis domestic demand in our us retail business grew over  in the second quarter by comparison international demand declined about  for a net comp increase of  weve seen the biggest impact from lower international traffic in the southeast in some of our largest most productive stores in florida these have historically been our best performing outlet stores that have benefited from international tourism sales to international tourists dropped from  of our retail sales in the first half of  to  in the first half of this year this decrease impacted retail comps by about  percentage points as the volatility in exchange rates has begun to moderate were seeing a positive correlation in retail sales there are reasons to be hopeful that these trends may continue that said we are also cautious knowing that they may not to achieve our growth objectives this year we have initiatives focused on providing the best value and experience in young childrens apparel extending the reach of our brands and improving profitability we believe one of our most impactful initiatives is our strategy to make shopping for our brands more convenient for consumers we plan to open  beautiful stores in north america this year most of these stores are located in highvalue nonmall shopping centers our best performing stores this year are located outside of outlet centers closer to the consumer our best performing stores are the cobranded sidebyside stores providing the best assortment of our carters and oshkosh bgosh brands in one convenient location to encourage more frequent online shopping and store visits we have recently rolled out technology that enables consumers to shop online and pick up their purchases in our stores with more of our stores located closer to the consumer we believe this option for free shipping has become more attractive since launching this initiative about  of consumers choose to have the product shipped to our stores and when they pick up their order we have seen additional purchases made in the store we continue to see good performance from other initiatives this year which include our new loyalty program extended sizes for both brands and expanded shoe offerings our rewards program was launched in october last year prior to its launch our loyalty program was not available to our ecommerce shoppers the consumers response to this initiative has exceeded our expectations nearly  of transactions in our stores and online are with customers who have enrolled in the rewards program this program captures important consumer information which enables us to engage them more effectively were seeing higher redemption rates and higher spending upon redemption were also seeing higher sales per customer and more frequent visits we believe weve improved the scope of our product offerings this year in addition to little baby basics launched in may we now have extended sizes for both brands if you recall we launched size  for carters last year and sold out earlier than expected weve sourced more product for this fall and are seeing a nice lift in sales this fall weve also launched size  for oshkosh bgosh its early but we believe this initiative will enable us to outfit more children for a longer period of time weve also expanded our shoe offering this year like apparel we believe consumers want high quality high value footwear for their children from brands that they trust were also reaching more consumers internationally through our global distribution capabilities we saw strong demand in international sales which grew  in the second quarter up  in constant currency and up  yeartodate our business in canada continued to strengthen its number one market share position in young childrens apparel we now own over  share of the canadian young childrens apparel market double the share of the next largest specialty retailer the next largest component of our international business is supported by retailers representing our brands in over  countries despite the turmoil in the world and effects of currency devaluation were expecting this part of our business to produce over  million in sales this year which is comparable to last year china is the next largest international opportunity for us the number of annual births is four times that of the united states we continue to believe china sales could exceed  million by  with respect to improving profitability we are focused on increasing our direct sourcing capabilities improving distribution center efficiencies strengthening inventory management capabilities and improving oshkosh profitability collectively our profit improvement initiatives should enable us to achieve a  operating margin by  in summary we made good progress improving our business in the first half of this year given the strength of our brands in the marketplace and multichannel model we believe were on track to have another good year of growth in sales and earnings looking beyond  were encouraged by reports indicating an improved trend in the us birth rate for moms who are  years and older recent reports also suggest that the job market and the housing market are improving and the presidential election will be behind us and some of the uncertainties that weigh on consumer behavior may moderate i want to thank our employees throughout the company who helped us achieve the results were reporting this morning im grateful for their passion for our brands and their commitment to help us execute our growth plans richard will now walk you through the presentation on our website richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you mike good morning everyone we have a good quarter to tell you about today and ill begin my comments on page two with some overall highlights consolidated net sales grew  which was at the high end of our prior guidance growth was driven by our us retail and international businesses adjusted operating income was roughly comparable to last year at  million adjusted operating margin declined by  basis points reflecting gross margin improvement offset by increased investments to support our growth agenda adjusted earnings per share were also about comparable to last year at  which was better than our previous expectation largely due to lower than planned spending in the quarter some portion of this spending favorability we believe is due to timing and does not represent upside for our full year earnings outlook negative movements in foreign exchange continued to be a headwind in the second quarter including continued lower demand from international consumers shopping in our us stores and on our website weve estimated that the various effects of foreign exchange throughout the pl cost us approximately  million in top line revenue and approximately  to  in earnings in the second quarter moving to page three with details of our sales performance in the second quarter our carters business in the us grew  driven by strong growth of  in our carters retail segment carters retail achieved a comp of plus  with both stores and ecommerce contributing to the positive comp our oshkosh business in the us grew  with the oshkosh retail segment contributing nearly  million to our sales growth international delivered another solid quarter growing  compared to last year with growth of  on a constant currency basis our canadian retail business and new ecommerce business in china drove the growth in this segment ill cover our business segment results in more detail in a moment turning to our second quarter pl on page four consolidated gross margin improved by  basis points to  this performance reflects a modest improvement in average unit pricing largely due to a higher mix of retail sales and lower product costs adjusted sga grew  in the second quarter consistent with recent quarters the expense increase and higher sga rate were driven by growth in our retail businesses in the us and canada as well as investments in our ecommerce business in china to a lesser degree investments in marketing and higher technology spending also contributed to the increase as i noted a moment ago second quarter sga was lower than forecasted some portion of this upside relates to the timing of spend in such areas as consulting hr and marketing we expect well now incur these costs in the second half of the year continuing down below operating income the interest and other line reflects a  loss in the quarter related to unfavorable settlements and reevaluation of foreign currency forward contracts this loss compares to a gain of nearly  million in last years second quarter interest expense was comparable yearoveryear our effective tax rate was  down somewhat compared to last year primarily due to increased contributions from our international businesses for the full year were forecasting an effective tax rate of approximately  consistent with  our weighted average share count declined approximately  versus last year reflecting our share repurchase activity the results of all those items was bottom line adjusted earnings per share of  compared to  in last years second quarter pages five through seven summarize our yeartodate performance in the first half of the year weve delivered good top line growth of  expanded gross margin and weve grown earnings as expected sales and margins in the first half were weighed down by lower sales to international consumers shopping in the us our spending is higher although less than we had planned as weve continued to invest in our retail businesses and in critical infrastructure and omnichannel initiatives now turning to page eight with a few balance sheet and cash flow highlights our liquidity at quarterend remained solid with a cash position of over  million and available capacity under our credit facility of over  million quarterend inventories increased  versus last year principally due to business growth we believe our inventory quality was very good as we exited the second quarter operating cash flow for the first half of the year was  million near a record high for us compared to  million last year favorable movements in net working capital and higher earnings drove the improvement over last year first half capital expenditures were comparable to last year at  million significant areas of investment this year include new stores in the us and canada as well as various information technology projects free cash flow in the first half improved to  million driven by strong operating cash flow weve made good progress in returning capital to our shareholders and have now returned three times as much as we had at this time last year through the first two quarters of  we repurchased  million of our stock and paid  million in dividends for a total return to shareholders of  million with respect to our capital structure we have concluded for now that were comfortable with our current leverage profile our adjusted leverage is about  times which we think is reasonable and consistent with our peer group this leverage level along with our substantial borrowing capacity provides us with significant financial flexibility and strength we hope to continue to return excess capital to shareholders this is a priority for us should we require liquidity to support this initiative or the business we have substantial capacity under our existing credit facility we think this is a better approach at this time than pursuing more structured longerterm financing our review of our capital structure is an ongoing exercise for us and something which we discuss with our board regularly page  summarizes our business segment results in the second quarter consolidated adjusted operating income was roughly comparable to the prior year at  million and adjusted operating margin was  compared to  last year our us wholesale oshkosh retail and international businesses delivered stronger operating margins while our carters retail segment margin declined corporate expenses deleveraged  basis points compared to last year principally due to spending on the upgrade of our core financial systems moving to our individual business segments in more detail beginning with carters wholesale on page  as planned net sales for carters wholesale in the second quarter declined yearoveryear net sales were affected by the timing of customer demand both earlier demand from some customers which fell into the first quarter as well as some fall product shipments planned for the third quarter as opposed to second quarter last year on a first half basis net sales in our carters wholesale business grew  which was consistent with our plan net sales in this part of the business are now planned to be comparable to last year for the full year carters wholesale segment operating profit was comparable to last year at  million segment margin improved by  basis points to  reflecting favorable product mix and lower product costs as mike mentioned weve moderated somewhat our sales forecast in our wholesale segment consistent with the challenges which many of our wholesale customers particularly those with a high concentration of stores in traditional shopping malls have articulated regarding their businesses page  shows a recent carters floor set at babies r us one of our important wholesale partners one of our key strategic priorities is to provide the best value and experience in young childrens apparel wherever mom is shopping including in the wholesale channel its important to us that she finds our brands in a way that emphasizes the strength of our value proposition and the beauty and quality of our products this is a good example of where we have partnered with a significant wholesale customer to elevate the signage fixturing and branding surrounding the carters assortment carried at babies r us turning to page  and the carters retail segment total carters us retail segment sales increased  versus last year carters retail segment samestore sales grew  over last year with store comps up  and ecommerce comp sales growing  were pleased with our retail performance in light of such soft consumer traffic trends in the marketplace our analysis indicates our carters retail stores fairly significantly exceeded industry traffic benchmarks in the second quarter in q we opened  new stores and closed one over the last year weve added  net new carters stores in the us new stores are delivering good returns with average aftertax return on investment in excess of  carters retail segment profits in the second quarter were comparable to last year at  million segment operating margin declined by  basis points principally driven by store expense deleverage mostly from new store expenses higher promotional activity due to lower international consumer demand and increased marketing spend and investments in technology on page  weve updated the analysis weve shared previously which estimates the meaningful effects we believe of lower international traffic on our us retail businesses in the second quarter consistent with the last few quarters weve seen good demand from domestic consumers but a significant decline in demand from international consumers shopping in our us stores and on carterscom our forecast assumes that the declines in demand from international consumers will be less significant in the second half than what weve seen over the past several quarters weve already seen some meaningful improvements in international demand in ecommerce the stores however continue to be under pressure if the decline in us retail store sales to international consumers were to continue to decline at roughly the same yearoveryear pace that weve been experiencing it would represent an estimated additional  million in sales and profit risk to our current forecast pages  and  contain portions of the latest carters direct mail piece these pages showcase our latest take on our iconic carters bodysuit a musthave in every babys wardrobe as well as our updated sets which provide easy dressing options for parents all at great prices now moving to page  and oshkosh retail results oshkosh total retail segment net sales grew  driven by new store openings and growth in ecommerce oshkoshs retail comp declined approximately  comprised of ecommerce comp growth of  and a store comp decline of  we believe lower demand from international consumers disproportionately affected the oshkosh store comp performance given the concentration of international tourist outlets in the oshkosh brands store portfolio nearly twothirds of oshkosh stores are in outlet centers compared to only onethird for carters nonoutlet oshkosh stores principally sidebyside stores comped positively in the second quarter in q we opened  new stores and closed one over the past  months weve opened  net new oshkosh stores we ended the second quarter with a  sidebyside format stores which now represent  of the oshkosh store portfolio these new stores are delivering good returns with an average aftertax return on investment in excess of  oshkosh retail segment income in the second quarter improved by about  segment operating margin improved by  basis points reflecting distribution efficiencies and lower product costs these benefits were somewhat offset by store expense deleverage increased marketing and investments in technology pages  and  feature selections from our recent oshkosh direct mail piece these pages convey the value quality and relevance of the oshkosh brand as we enter the important backtoschool shopping season page  is a photo of one of our newest sidebyside stores in the minneapolis st paul market in this particular location we had an opportunity to add a new oshkosh store to an existing successful carters store in order to establish a sidebyside location and meaningfully increase the selection of our brands and products available to the consumer moving to our international segment on page  our international segment achieved very solid growth again this quarter second quarter reported net sales increased  and grew  on a constant currency basis our canadian store and ecommerce businesses continue to perform very well canada retail comps increased  with solid comps in both stores and ecommerce our international ecommerce business more than doubled in the second quarter with net sales growing to  million compared to approximately  million last year our china tmall business launched at the end of q last year drove most of this growth net sales in the wholesale component of our international segment were  million compared to  million in last years second quarter largely reflecting lower shipments to mexico on a full year basis were forecasting  net sales in this component of international to be comparable to  international segment adjusted operating income in the second quarter grew by  to  million segment operating margin improved by approximately  basis points to  principally driven by the strong comp sales and improved profit contribution from canada partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects page  includes a photo of one of our newest stores in canada this toronto area location opened in may and represents our second mall location in canada results to date have been very encouraging now turning to page  for our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal  for the third quarter we expect net sales to grow approximately  to  principally driven by growth in our us retail and international businesses we anticipate modest growth in our carters wholesale segment were forecasting third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow approximately  to  compared to an adjusted eps of  in the third quarter of  this earnings forecast contemplates gross margin improvement on a yearoveryear basis and sga deleverage in part due to planned spending that has shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter for full year  we now expect net sales to grow approximately  to  driven by our us retail and international businesses this compares to our prior outlook of growth of  to  as mentioned this revised sales outlook reflects in part more modest expectations for wholesale and international demand in the second half we continue to forecast good growth in profitability in  we now expect adjusted eps to grow approximately  compared to s adjusted  per share risks that were monitoring include inconsistent trends in consumer demand and store traffic both in our retail business and with our wholesale customers foreign exchange rates the level of promotional activity in the marketplace and consumer sentiment in light of the ongoing presidential election cycle and the overall macroeconomic environment with these comments were ready to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir and for our first question we go to ike boruchow with wells fargo ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my question michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc so i think just about every vendor thats reported so far has talked about weaker q orders so it makes some sense what youre seeing in wholesale i guess my question is is that due to a particular channel whether it be midtier department stores or the mass channel and then how are your sellthroughs at pos within the wholesale channel any change there relative to the first half brian j lynch  president yeah id say a couple of things weve got good initiatives out there in wholesale but the retail environment does continue to be challenging especially were finding the brickandmortar and mallbased department stores our online business is very good and growing rapidly at virtually all the accounts so our latest view with our sales this year in wholesale as i guess richard said are going to be comparable to the last year as far as spring  just to give you a little color on that the bookings process is still ongoing but at this point we do believe that they will come in lower than last year and thats primarily softness were seeing in that mallbased department store bookings segment of the business theyre going to be down but they do represent a much smaller portion of our wholesale segment at this point its about  of our segment is the mallbased department store business so were continuing to invest with our partners in presentation and driving sales to their websites and continue to support them in their efforts to drive the business you asked about selling i would say spring overall as we finished up id say we had a really good playwear season sellthroughs were good i would say in some of the other categories the sellthroughs were not quite as high as wed hoped the inventories are up just a little bit more than we would probably have anticipated in some of the accounts but we think thats going to normalize quickly if you remember the fall bookings were comparable to last year so overall the channel we think this year we can finish up comparable to last year maybe up slightly we feel good about that we still have the spring bookings underway weve got a lot of good initiatives out there were driving online businesses driving the playwear business presentation i think weve spoken about the coles  playwear strategy which were coming up on comping that from last year and they continue to see very good results with the expansion of our playwear business with that account as well ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it and it sounds like there shouldnt be much variability q and q on your wholesale performance is that fair richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i think brians comments ike are more directed towards the outlook for spring bookings there is a portion of the spring shipments that go in the fourth quarter i think thats the piece that weve moderated our expectations at this point were continuing to have a good outlook i think for the shipments of our fall products but were watching that as well ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it thanks so much michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator and for our next question we go to susan anderson with fbr capital markets susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my question i was wondering if i could just dig in a little bit deeper on the wholesale orders for the fall so it sounds like basically they came back to you guys and brought them down a little bit because i think theyre supposed to be modestly up before brian j lynch  president i think we said before that they were comparable to last year if not up modestly so when you put it all together you got the fall bookings susan and then youve also got spring  bookings and some component of spring  bookings are preships that go in the back half of this year late in the fourth quarter and thats the key reason were moderating the outlook those we do believe will be down slightly to last year so when you put that all together with fall bookings and spring preship bookings thats how we arrived at that revision susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co got it okay thats helpful and then i think you guys also said that you expect international to slow a bit maybe if you could just touch on that a little bit is that still the tourist impact or is that coming from canada or other parts of the international business michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer theres a few parts the spring  bookings from our international customers are also expected to be lower than we previously expected given issues in their different parts of the world and the continued effects of the stronger dollar so thats one component the other component is the rampup in our new china ecommerce business that business will more than double this year just wont be at the same level of demand that we had previously forecast probably the biggest challenge in our business though i would say is the level of international demand from international tourists shopping with us in the united states both in our stores and online thankfully were starting to see some recovery online it appears though theyre coming back shopping online even though that business was down in the second quarter if youd exclude the big drop in china online international demand was actually up online in the second quarter so were starting to see some recovery havent seen as much recovery yet in our stores were starting to see some recovery in some of the larger outlet stores in florida but it hasnt been sustained so our biggest assumptions in the second half are as exchange rates start to normalize yearoveryear the international guest is coming back and so we put reasonable assumptions on both our ecommerce business and the stores were seeing recovery online not so much in the stores yet susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co got it thats helpful and then one last question on the oshkosh business so it seems like after several good quarters of comps it turned negative is that just as you guys kind of cycle more difficult compares or is there anything else that youre seeing in that business michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer id say the arrow is pointing up on oshkosh oshkosh is making good progress had positive comps in june expecting positive comps in the second half you got to keep in mind twothirds of oshkosh stores are in outlet centers and a good chunk of those outlet centers are in tourist locations so we saw a big drop off in tourist locations for oshkosh and carters but having twothirds of these stores in outlet centers works against oshkosh our plan is to over the next five years take that mix of outlet stores from what is twothirds to less than a third and were seeing very good performance from our sidebyside stores the best traffic and the best comps are in our sidebyside stores thats where you have the best of carters and best of oshkosh sitting sidebyside the feedback from consumers on those stores have been good the comps have been good and every store we open going forward for oshkosh will be in the cobranded format susan k anderson  fbr capital markets  co great thats really helpful thanks so much good luck to next quarter michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer thanks very much operator for our next question we go to robert ohmes with bank of america merrill lynch daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch good morning this is dan ohare on behalf of robbie ohmes michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer hi dan daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch hey so how has the little baby basics launch go or yeah how has it performed postlaunch and is that primarily a retail or is that wholesale as well thanks brian j lynch  president yeah the little baby basics launch is all channels we successfully launched that in may i think we did a good job with strong marketing and brand presentation across the channels the product is doing particularly well on line in all channels i would say a little less so in the stores the replenishment trends with our wholesale partners weve moderated that forecast slightly based on initial out of the gate there are some products that are doing really well and other ones that we are refreshing we have about  of the business life cycle and so its early but were monitoring that sellthrough as they finish clearing up their old program and we do have some refreshed creative for key components of that launch which arrive later in the year to support fall and holiday selling daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch got it and then could you just remind us how many signups that the rewarding moments loyalty program has michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer my understanding right now its over  million so it continues to grow were surprised as we dug into what percentage of the transactions both online and in stores are tied to the rewarding moments program its nearly  so its been a very very successful program drawing more people back to the stores after their initial purchase so its been well received daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch got it and then has there been any increase in the transaction size with the customers that have recently signed up or any michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer yes yes daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch awesome michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer weve seen it yeah daniel ryan ohare  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks so much michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator and were going next to anna andreeva with oppenheimer anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi great thanks good morning guys and congrats on really strong q results michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer thanks anna anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker i guess i had a couple of questions first remind us how much of your business is replenishment in the fourth quarter and your ability to chase just in case better demand ends up realizing secondly richard gross margins very strong in the second quarter maybe talk about the dynamics between aur and auc and how should we think about gross margins for the back half and then finally you mentioned we should expect positive comps in retail for q and q what are you guys seeing so far in july thanks brian j lynch  president ill take the replenishment question replenishment in our wholesale business is about  to  of the business overall in the back half of the year we position inventory in the shelf here we give it a quick testing on things like little baby basics in our stores and we change our forecast based on that to make sure that we try to keep the best articles in stock so we do go a little bit long on some things so we do have ability to id say ratchet that number up if it merits significant chase no because of lead times but we do have the ability to service that i think at a good level richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president and on gross margin for the second quarter id say there are obviously multiple things at work there you have the ongoing benefit of lower product costs we do expect that will continue in the second half of this year pricing a less significant component we did have a modest improvement in pricing some portion of that is mix related both from growing the higher aur businesses including retail stores and ecommerce i think those are the primary effects for the second quarter for second half we have good continued gross margin reflected in our forecast actually the basis point expansion yearoveryear would be if were successful with our forecast above what we achieved in the first half were hoping that we dont have the same measure of liquidation activity that we had a year ago with all that inventory that we procured for the international consumers i think we were sharper in how we made our inventory commitments for the second half with the benefit of that analysis so continuing to forecast the benefit of lower product costs hopefully with less liquidation activity and continuing growth of our high margin businesses thats how i would characterize the outlook for margin michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer you asked about third quarter comps both brands are comping positively third quarter todate had a strong start to the quarter with good demand for both brands over the th of july holiday saw a similarly good demand over the memorial day weekend but july got off to a strong start see the last couple of weeks had been a little under what we had expected but not materially so id say third quarter todate were on track to have positive comps anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker awesome thanks guys good luck michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer thanks very much operator and for our next question we go to kate mcshane with citi research kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning thanks for taking my question just to drill down again at the wholesale account could you give us any insight into how promotional those accounts have been especially at the brickandmortar department stores and how you see that playing out for the second half with regards to your gross margin guidance brian j lynch  president i think that overall the retail environment continues to be promotional kate i dont know that its backed off at all retailers are using different models to drive traffic to their sites as the customer preshops and they want conversion on their sites as well as drive folks in their stores so there continues to be i would say significant promotional activity certainly not less i would say its at or above what it was in prior years we were slightly more promotional in our retail channel primarily due to our loyalty program and then the impact of international but people are trying very different things as we said the department stores and the mallbased i think its been well chronicled in the media some of the challenges theyre having so theyre trying different things to drive traffic to their stores kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thank you and my second question is on retail can you remind us at what comp you need to leverage both for carters and oshkosh and with oshkosh shifting away from outlet over time how does that impact some of the occupancy and the rent michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer our objective is to achieve a  comp – a retail comp for each of the brands at that level above that level we leverage sga below we deleverage and as we open up these oshkosh stores keep in mind once we open up the oshkosh stores they are attached to carters and were seeing a very good profit contribution from both brands because there is a sharing of the overhead sharing of the real estate build out effort so thats – the sidebyside model is much more profitable than standalone stores and so were seeing good performance with oshkosh seeing good comps the closer the oshkosh store is to the consumer the better the performance so we had positive comps for oshkosh in the second quarter from the brand stores and the sidebyside stores and so were not concerned that by opening up more oshkosh stores it will put more pressure on our goals to achieve that  operating margin by  it actually supports it kate mcshane  citigroup global markets inc broker thank you michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator we go next to steph wissink with piper jaffray stephanie schiller wissink  piper jaffray  co broker thanks good morning everyone mike i wanted to just focus on your longerterm guidance the  billion in revenue and that  that you just mentioned can you help us understand maybe what the complexion of the business might look like out a few years relative to the segment drivers it seems like wholesale may be stepping down a little bit retail stepping up and then international contributing a bit more can you help us appreciate maybe what the puts and takes are as we look forward a few years michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer sure your understanding is correct were planning lowsingledigit growth in our wholesale business and that currently is under a bit of pressure were still hoping that our wholesale sales this year are comparable yearoveryear some of our wholesale partners are going through some changes in their business we hope those changes work for them and that we grow off of a different base of business but we still believe theres some growth possible for wholesale that was not the lions share of the growth the biggest growth driver in our longterm plan is through the sidebyside stores our objective is to open up  sidebyside stores when you open those stores they contribute some portion of about  million in annual sales its a wonderful  billion growth opportunity as we open these stores were seeing an interesting lift in ecommerce sales where those stores open up relative to the adjacent trade area so were seeing a benefit in ecommerce were certainly seeing that on our oshkosh brand oshkosh ecommerce comps were actually better than carters comps in the second quarter and thats unusual usually nothing outperforms carters but oshkosh at least online did in the second quarter and then international were expecting doubledigit growth in international lots of ways to grow the two big growth drivers in international will be canada because there is more room to grow in canada and china but we also have well over  partners representing our brands in over  countries good retailers working hard to grow their businesses and ours and so the two big good growth drivers for international will be canada and china thats our expectation so this is the way i think of the business i think of lowsingle digit growth in wholesale think of highsingle digit growth in store sales think of doubledigit growth in ecommerce and in international sales those are our growth objectives stephanie schiller wissink  piper jaffray  co broker thats really helpful thanks and then just as a followup to that can you remind us at what level the international or the china business specifically becomes accretive i think you called it out as a drag in the quarter so just help us appreciate where that curve starts to bend michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer trying to understand your question say international sales stephanie schiller wissink  piper jaffray  co broker on the china specifically i think that was what was called out michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer well china i believe made money in the second quarter its modest again keep in mind china ecommerce some portion of – we hope that some portion of  million business this year relative to the  billion but china is not a drag on our earnings right now its a modest contribution richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president steph we have some other startup costs as well in china that are coming through the pl theres distribution center expenses building some of the infrastructure capabilities that were going to need longterm so in addition to china ecommerce mikes correct made a small amount of money it is a smaller margin business today than obviously the other more mature parts of the portfolio but were making good progress but we are making some investments there stephanie schiller wissink  piper jaffray  co broker all right thanks guys operator we go next to jim chartier with monness crespi  hardt sic monness crespi hardt  jim a chartier  monness crespi hardt  co inc good morning thanks for taking my questions michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning jim a chartier  monness crespi hardt  co inc first it sounds like the larger size initiative maybe exceeded your expectations last year is that opportunity do you think bigger now than you originally expected and do you plan to go into higher sizes for carters going forward brian j lynch  president i think were very pleased with how its going we did sell out last year we sourced a bunch more as mike noted of size  this year i dont know that were prepared to give an exact number in terms of revenue impact this year but weve also added size  for oshkosh that is on plan and out of the gate as well so well continue to roll those out i think weve got an opportunity in our stores and online to grow that and id like to think that that can help us grow the business with our wholesale partners as well several of them have taken part in the size  in carters some have not based on the way their floors are laid out and organized so lets hope that thats the case and again we started – we think carters wed like to have the life of the consumer extended with us so we started with size  and we feel good about that and if that makes sense maybe we go higher at some point jim a chartier  monness crespi hardt  co inc great and then richard just want to get some more specificity on kind of the impact that youre assuming for the international component of your comp sales do you expect that to still be down and a drag on comp sales in the back half of the year do you expect that to get to flat in the back half thanks michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer yeah we do expect that and the stores component in particular will be down in the second half although at an improved position relative to what weve seen recently but still pressure in the second half jim a chartier  monness crespi hardt  co inc great thanks and best of luck richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome thank you operator and we go next to john kernan with cowen john kernan  cowen  co llc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question can you help us understand sga dollar growth or sga as a percent of sales in the back half obviously theres still some square footage growth to come and it sounds like theres more investments in it and china as well richard f westenberger  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure john well we continue to shift the balance of the business to the higher sga format businesses that we have retail stores ecommerce theyre much higher sga businesses than wholesale weve mentioned that weve taken down our forecast for wholesale so we would expect the sga rate will continue to increase there are some discrete investments that were making around some it technology some infrastructure and some discrete projects to help the retail business to build out our omnichannel capabilities that funding will continue to some extent those projects are a little bit behind where we thought they would be from a spending point of view in the first half of the year so some of that spending shifts forward and we have a couple discrete consulting engagements that are also running here in the second half of the year those will both drive up the dollar amount of sga and the rate in the second half john kernan  cowen  co llc thats helpful thanks can you help us also understand the durability of lower product cost as a benefit to your gross margin for what its worth weve seen cotton pickup a little bit in recent weeks michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer youre right cotton has gone up at least a dime and so were keeping an eye on it oil continues to be favorable freight continues to be favorable probably the most single largest impact on our costs going forward will be global capacity which is abundant given the overall weak demand for apparel globally were growing were one of the few apparel companies growing so were seeing hungry manufacturers eager to do business with us and working with us to meet our cost objectives so we have visibility through spring  for product costs and were expecting those costs to be down well surely be working on fall  probably by october well have some indication of how costs are trending in the second half of  where visibility into the first half of  is good we expect a lower product cost in the first half of next year john kernan  cowen  co llc thats helpful thanks and then just one final question congrats on the big acceleration in carters samestore sales can you help us understand the drivers of the operating margin decline on the improved sales michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer just id say the timing of store openings – keep in mind the second quarter is the lightest quarter of the year so the store expenses are the same – relatively the same from quartertoquarter youll start to see improvement in the second half of the year so the deleverage you see in the second quarter segment profitability for retail you will see that improve we expect that that will improve meaningfully in the second half and still will be a bit of deleverage for the year but not as significant as youre seeing in the second quarter john kernan  cowen  co llc okay thank you best of luck michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer thanks very much operator and we go next to janet kloppenburg with jjk research janet j kloppenburg  jjk research good morning everyone michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer good morning janet j kloppenburg  jjk research i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your spring  wholesale outlook i think you said it may be down yearoveryear and i was wondering if you could help us understand if thats just ongoing conservatism by the midtier department stores or something else so perhaps the international wholesale business or if youre seeing increased competition there maybe from owned brands or other new competitors in the marketplace brian j lynch  president yeah i think as we said a few minutes ago we do plan to see the spring  bookings lower than last year and weve got ways to go a lot of our mass bookings are not even in yet they book a little bit later but that is primarily a mallbased apartment store issue were optimistic with the sum total of the account base the rest of the account base that we continue to have good performance but this represents somewhere around   of our wholesale business and we would project that that would be down as far as competition youve got some of these folks and department stores particularly that are trying to make a goal of it and drive traffic and they have strategic shifts and they certainly do lean into private label they make different decisions on their business and trying to have unique products so i think in terms of new competitors we would say no we dont see new competitors there are always the ups and downs and shifts of folks growing and rightsizing their private level businesses and i would say its fair to say that is going in department stores janet j kloppenburg  jjk research okay great and just specifically on the outlook stores i know the domestic – i mean i know the international oriented traffic stores were down deeply but are you seeing improvement in outlet store malls where its primarily a domestic customer michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer domestic demand generally has been good we track credit card data and so we can see the domestic demand for the brand is good but international is down as i shared with you online were starting to see improvement in the stores were starting to see some improvement in some of the larger international tourist locations and time will tell we expect it to improve in the second half the unknown is timing when will it start to moderate were assuming some moderation more so online than the stores based on our experience to date janet j kloppenburg  jjk research and just one last question on the wholesale channel please if that business continues to be under pressure should we expect operating profitability in that channel to also be under pressure michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer it may it may time will tell were not forecasting it for the year were forecasting margin expansion for wholesale this year but time will tell because we dont have all the spring bookings in yet but in october well have better visibility to it for you janet j kloppenburg  jjk research okay also i think you made some reference to inventories maybe being a little bit high in the channel and i wondered if you had to have some mark down reconciliation with the stores brian j lynch  president no we have a different model with our wholesale partners an upfront discount model so the answer to the question is no to reiterate the inventory yes there is some inventory thats elevated some of the product categories playwear soldthrough the best some of the other categories did not have the sellthrough that the folks planned for many different reasons so there are some pockets out there but we booked flattish to up modestly for fall so in totality were not very concerned about it janet j kloppenburg  jjk research okay thanks so much for your time brian j lynch  president our pleasure thank you michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer welcome operator and with that ladies and gentlemen we have no further questions on our roster therefore mr casey i will turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks michael dennis casey  chairman  chief executive officer okay thanks very much thank you
