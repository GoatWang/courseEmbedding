people and play an interview with bob wann by stacey alcorn without a doubt bob wann ceo of patch products inc is a visionary leader and toy guru like youve never met hes been a leader in the toy industry for more than  years having lead sales marketing and operations for companies such as hasbros milton bradley and parker brothers playskool and fisher price originally from the uk bob has worked both domestically in the united states and across the globe he has embraced each position hes taken in the toy industry with passion perseverance and a determination to grow both the business and his knowledge base hes an expert not just in toys but also in consumer behavior branding and product licensing he also sits on the board of directors for the toy industry association bob wann is powered by pure ambition this drive has allowed him to scale the ranks of massive companies he is selfmade dynamic and humble i recently talked with bob to find out his secrets to putting the fun back in businessexpress you in your business ever since he can remember bob says he has always been an adventurer he loves traveling learning about new cultures and roaming he says that it is this love of adventure that has allowed him to climb the ranks of huge companies by the age of  years old he had already worked in six different countries and had lived in three of them this fed his appetite for exploring and searching out new ideas and experiences just out of high school while living in scotland bob went to work for the government he worked for the equivalent of the irs in the uk from there he decided to apply for a job at mm  mars in the uk it was an aggressive interviewing process but he was able to land a job in sales bob says that the sales training was so good at mars that he still uses the skills he learned there today what bob learned at mars was that he really wanted to be in marketing and branding there were no opportunities for growth at mars so he moved to johnson  johnson where they made a deal with him he could start in sales and if he did well theyd move him to marketing and new product development he moved to johnson  johnson and they fulfilled their promise giving him a taste at launching new products into the market in the late s fisher price had just entered the uk having recently become a dad he was interested in the idea of working in the toy industry ad so he reached out and soon became the marketing director for the uk subsidiary of fisher price at the time fisher price was becoming more global and fisher price was regularly sending bob to the us to sit on product review teams so that they could get his opinion on toys they were developing it wasnt long before bob became a permanent fixture in the united states with fisher price of his  years at the firm  were in america and he finally settled down in the united states for the long haul after spending the first half of his career feeding his insatiable appetite for freedom adventure and getting out into the world bob says that theres always a way to infuse your passion into the work you do bob married his love for exploration with his early corporate career giving him the opportunity to travel the globe while building brands he loved over time his family grew and his love for business outweighed his love for adventure and he eventually settled down in america in the beginning years of his career bob figured out a way to turn his love for adventure into his personal unique value proposition which catapulted him into higher and higher positions throughout his career embrace change bob says that if you want to differentiate yourself from other business leaders and executives be the person that embraces change bob notes that humans err on the side of comfort because change is always hard for bob the opposite is true in fact he says he gets easily bored with the status quo and prefers to try to new things to encourage growth and to always feel comfortable with the uncomfortable after ten years at fisher price bob moved to tcfc a subsidiary of american greetings where bob spent three years learning about licensing characters like care bears and strawberry shortcake his customers were toy companies like hasbro and mattel this was a big change for bob because now toys were in the periphery of his business no longer the absolute focus he took this time to further develop his knowledge of branding sales and consumer behavior and although he loved the licensing side of the business he eventually decided to get back into the trenches of the toy business going to work for the playskool line for hasbro bob eventually became the president of the hasbro games division overseeing legendary gaming product lines like monopoly scrabble trivial pursuit operation and candyland when silicon valley game knocking in the early s bob tried his hand leading schoolpop a school fundraising program that was way ahead of its time throughout most of his career bob has always been very involved in the toy industry association he enjoys learning from other toy executives and helping others by sharing his knowledge it was through the association that bob eventually met fran and bryce patch the two brothers who owned patch products a midsized toy company based out of wisconsin known for games such as farkle the game of things and perplexus d maze game the rest is history now with the company for five years he says hes right at home with a company that is constantly comfortable with change and trying new things for example while many toy companies are constantly finding ways to make their toddler toy lines beep buzz flash and zap patch products went a totally different way with the introduction of their mirari line of toys mirari means wonder in latin and patch has made it their mission to put the wonder back into play their mirari line envelopes the child into the play experience for example their line of alphabet blocks are made of see through plastic and small d letters and characters are suspended on monofilament and magnetized inside the clear block so that when a child puts one block next to another they magically come to life by wiggling and jiggling due to the magnetic interaction wann says that hes always comfortable working for and with companies that embrace change and new ideas like patch does because to him change is growth and the status quo is death play as bob sees it his job and the job of patch products is to inspire quality playtime in other words hes on a mission to get more families and friends to laugh and play together as such bob is a proponent of getting together with his own family to play games he says that admittedly in the world we live in its not easy to find a lot of time to sit and laugh with family however he notes that its not so much about pulling out the board games every night but about finding time every once in a while to get the whole family around the table for some fun i asked bob if the electronic world of apps are a threat to the toy industry and he answered emphatically no as bob sees it games played on an ipad tablet or phone are very different than other toys a game on an electronic device is often played alone or something that is played while you are on the move or have a few minutes of downtime in your busy life he said that the toys and games developed by patch products are meant for strong social interaction  real inperson facetoface human interaction so that a family can have laugh out loud fun together have insatiable curiosity as bob wann sees it success in almost any consumer driven business requires that you are constantly on alert as to what people around you are doing how do they interact what causes people to laugh how do they have fun bob says that theres no telling where the next big idea will come from in the toy industry but its usually born out of someone noticing how a consumer reacts to something for example in the toy industry ugly sells this trend was set many years ago says wann by the cabbage patch kids who would have thought that little kids would yearn for what were seen by many as ugly little dolls but they did not because they were ugly but because they were not stereotypically pretty they were seen by little kids as being vulnerable therefore little kids wanted to take care of and nurture something so vulnerable looking as bob notes the only way to notice that kind of consumer behavior is to have insatiable curiosity and to always be studying what makes people tick if you believe you can bob says that the number one piece of advice he has for anyone looking to build a business climb the corporate ladder or accomplish anything in life is to believe in yourself as bob sees it if you believe you can do it you can he says that instead of spending any time seeking excuses as to why you cant do something spend that time figuring out a way to accomplish your goal bob gave two great examples of this from his personal life first when bobs youngest daughter turned  years old she asked her dad if she could find a way for her to meet john green the author of the fault in our stars and other bestselling books the movie based on johns book was just about to premiere so it seemed unlikely that bob could pull off a gift like that for his girl but he chose not to focus on excuses and instead he started working the phones to figure out a way not only did he get his daughter into meet john green they attended the movie premiere with him and she walked away with a signed copy of his book bob says that when you believe in yourself and when you make a conscious decision to never take no for an answer you can have anything you want second bobs older daughter was involved in a lifechanging serious accident last year that left her with quadriplegic injuries confining her to a wheelchair then through the power of positive thinking exactly one year and one day after her accident she participated in her first wheelchair triathlon its a great example of what believing in yourself can help you achieve in life bob wann offers a compelling story for any selfmade business person
