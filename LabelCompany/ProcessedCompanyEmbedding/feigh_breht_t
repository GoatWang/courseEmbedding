american dental partners inc “adpi” gregory a serrao “serrao” breht t feigh “feigh” and mark w vargo “vargo” collectively the “defendants” and together with lead plaintiff the “settling parties” the terms of the settlement are set forth in the class action settlement agreement dated as of december   “settlement agreement” which is being filed concurrently with this motion under the settlement defendants will cause their directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier to pay  six million dollars in cash to the class in return for complete and unconditional releases and discharges from all of the released claims as defined in the settlement agreement lead plaintiff respectfully submits that preliminary approval of the settlement is appropriate the settlement was reached after a mediation in september  conducted by the honorable nicholas politan and represents the product of good faith arm’slength negotiations among experienced securities counsel for the settling parties in entering into the settlement the settling parties are fully conversant with the strengths and weaknesses of this action having briefed a motion by defendants to dismiss the claims asserted by lead plaintiff and having embarked on discovery being thus wellpositioned to evaluate the risks of continued litigation versus the fairness and prudence of a resolution at this time each of the settling parties believes the settlement produces a fair and reasonable result for these reasons which are set forth more  ascribed to the terms in the settlement agreement unless otherwise specified defined terms used in this memorandum of law shall have the same meaning as case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  fully below the settlement meets the test for preliminary approval in that it is fair reasonable and adequate accordingly lead plaintiff requests that the court enter an order in the form of the accompanying proposed order of preliminary approval  preliminarily certifying the class  granting preliminary approval of the proposed settlement  approving the settling parties’ proposed form and method of giving notice to the class of the pendency of this litigation and of the

lead plaintiff on behalf of a class the “class” consisting of all persons who purchased or acquired stock of adpi during the period from february   to december   the “class period” lead plaintiff asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” against defendants adpi serrao at all relevant times the chairman president and chief executive officer of adpi feigh at all relevant times the executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer of adpi and vargo at all relevant times the vice president and chief accounting officer of adpi as alleged in lead plaintiff’s consolidated class action complaint dated september   the “complaint” adpi was founded in  as a “management service organization” a  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  company that affiliates with and provides management and administrative support services to dental practices in  pdhc ltd “pdhc” a whollyowned subsidiary of adpi entered into an affiliation agreement the “service agreement” with pdg pa “pdg” a professional association of dentists who practiced dentistry in the minneapolisst paul region of minnesota under the business name “park dental” lead plaintiff alleges that commencing in  adpi and its subsidiary pdhc began engaging in conduct that violated the service agreement with pdg the alleged purpose of this conduct was to allow adpi to extract and report to investors increased revenue and earnings from the service agreement lead plaintiff alleges that adpi was able to divert to itself significant sums of money that should have been paid to pdg under the service agreement as well as implement various impermissible costcutting measures in violation of the service agreement thereby painting a picture of profitability that was false in adpi’s sec filings and various other public statements defendants allegedly attributed falsely adpi’s newly improved financial performance to the success of its business and other reasons pdg eventually commenced a lawsuit in february  initially against pdhc and later also against adpi in minnesota state court the “pdg lawsuit” arising from the various violations described above in response to this lawsuit defendants are alleged to have issued further misleading statements in adpi’s sec filings press releases and during conference calls that pdg’s claims were “without merit” and “baseless” and that adpi had always conducted its business towards pdg in the same way lead plaintiff alleges that defendants made these misstatements despite knowing that adpi had indeed violated the terms of the service agreement and that adpi faced significant liability with respect to pdg’s claims  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  lead plaintiff further alleges that in march  when pdg gave notice of its intention to terminate the service agreement defendants misled adpi’s investors by assuring the public markets that adpi would be able to replace the pdg dentists with new dentists and

conduct that subjected adpi to even greater legal liability b the action in march  a number of putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against adpi by order dated may   this court consolidated those actions into the present action appointed lead plaintiff to serve as lead plaintiff for the putative class under the private securities litigation reform act and appointed lead plaintiff’s counsel the law firm of grant  eisenhofer pa to serve as lead counsel for the putative class on september   after an extensive investigation that included review of testimony and evidence from the pdg lawsuit lead plaintiff filed the complaint the complaint asserts a claim under section b of the exchange act against all defendants and a claim under section a of the exchange act alleging control person liability against defendants serrao feigh and vargo on december   defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure contending that the complaint failed to state a claim and failed to allege fraud with particularity after full briefing and oral argument the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss in its entirety on april   the parties submitted to the court a joint statement pursuant to local rule d in the joint statement the parties informed the court that they were unable to reach agreement on a joint discovery plan because defendants sought to bifurcate discovery with  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  respect to class certification issues and discovery on the merits the court scheduled a status conference for june   at which it denied defendants’ request to bifurcate discovery the parties thereafter commenced exchanging discovery and serving subpoenas seeking relevant documents from third parties c mediation and the proposed settlement on september   during the course of discovery the settling parties conducted a mediation in an effort to resolve the action the honorable nicholas politan served as the mediator while the mediation session itself did not produce a settlement agreement the parties kept the lines of communication open and with judge politan’s able assistance were able to come to an agreementinprinciple on a settlement the terms of that settlement have been formalized in the settlement agreement under the settlement defendants’ insurance carrier shall pay  to

deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of the class no later than thirty days after entry of an order preliminarily approving the settlement the settlement agreement provides that at or before the final approval hearing class counsel will propose to the court a plan of allocation which shall provide for the manner of allocation of the settlement fund amongst all authorized claimants terms as defined in the settlement agreement the settlement agreement and its supporting papers provide for the form and manner of class notice the proof of claim procedures the procedures for seeking

argument i the court should grant preliminary approval of the settlement because it is within the range of value warranting approval public policy in the first circuit highly favors settlement as a means of resolving disputes see hotel holiday inn de isla verde v nlrb  fd   st cir  settlement agreements “will be upheld whenever possible because they are a means of amicably resolving doubts and preventing lawsuits” united states v comunidades unidas contra la contaminacion  fd   st cir  this is especially so in the context of complex class action litigation see eg in re lupron mktg  sales

steps the judge is required to scrutinize the proposed settlement to ensure that it is fair to the persons whose interests the court is to protect those affected may be entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard this usually involves a two  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  stage procedure first the judge reviews the proposal preliminarily to determine whether it is sufficient to warrant public notice and a hearing if so the final decision on approval is made after the hearing in re relafen antitrust litig  frd   d mass  quoting manual for complex litigation fourth “mcl” §  see also in re lupron mktg  sales practices litig  f supp d  d mass  at the preliminary approval stage of this twostep process the court is not required to undertake an indepth consideration of the relevant factors for final approval instead the “judge must make a preliminary determination on the fairness reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement terms and must direct the preparation of notice of the certification proposed settlement and date of the final fairness hearing” mcl §  if the court finds a settlement proposal “within the range of possible approval” it then proceeds to the second step in the review process the fairness hearing in re gilat satellite networks ltd  us dist lexis  at  edny apr   “preliminary approval of a proposed settlement is appropriate where it is the result of serious informed and noncollusive negotiations where there are no grounds to doubt its fairness and no other obvious deficiencies    and where the settlement appears to fall within the range of possible approval” citing mcl §  in re med xray film antitrust litig  us dist lexis  at  edny dec   applying the approach set forth above the court should preliminarily approve the settlement because it is sufficiently fair reasonable and adequate and thus falls squarely within the range of possible approval first the settlement amount of  represents a fair and reasonable result after more than a year of litigation during this time each side vigorously advocated its position as described in the statement of facts above the settlement amount of  reflects among  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  other things the evidence developed against defendants and at the same time recognizes the inherent risks costs and potential for delay associated with a complex securities litigation including the meaningful possibility that defendants would be unable to pay a substantial judgment if lead plaintiff were to prevail in the litigation second as set forth above the proposed settlement is the result of intensive arm’slength negotiation between the settling parties arrived at after a mediation before a respected former judge with significant experience mediating complex class actions including actions asserting securities claims these factors – the time and effort spent on the settlement negotiations and the presence of a highlyregarded mediator – all militate in favor of preliminary approval of the settlement because they strongly indicate that there was no collusion in the result that was achieved see in re indep energy holdings plc sec litig  us dist lexis  at  sdny sept   “the fact that the settlement was reached after exhaustive arm’slength negotiations with the assistance of a private mediator experienced in complex litigation is further proof that it is fair

experienced capable counsel after meaningful discovery” internal quotation marks and citation omitted third the settling parties agreed to the terms of the settlement after conducting several months of discovery there is a presumption in favor of a proposed settlement when the parties have conducted sufficient discovery to allow them to investigate the pertinent factual and legal issues and to assess the merits of their respective cases city p’ship co v atlantic acquisition lp  fd  st cir  rolland v celluci  frd   d mass  in this  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  case lead plaintiff’s attorneys researched the claims against defendants for many months prior to the filing of the complaint including reviewing the court record in the underlying pdg lawsuit after defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied by this court the parties exchanged written initial disclosures propounded and responded to various requests for documents and interrogatories and served subpoenas on various third parties seeking additional relevant documents as a result of all of these efforts lead plaintiff was able to develop the facts concerning defendants’ potential liability and the settling parties and their counsel are capable of making wellinformed decisions regarding the settlement fourth the settling parties are represented by counsel experienced in securities class action litigation lead plaintiff’s counsel has extensive experience and expertise in complex securities litigation and class action proceedings throughout the united states counsel for defendants similarly has extensive expertise from a long track record in securities class actions and has vigorously defended defendants throughout the course of the litigation for all of these reasons lead plaintiff respectfully requests that the court preliminarily approve the settlement see hawkins v commissioner of nh dept of health and human services  us dist lexis  at  dnh jan   “a presumption in favor of the proposed settlement arises when sufficient discovery has been provided counsel have experience in similar cases and the parties have bargained at armslength” ii the court should preliminarily certify the class the proposed class consists of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired adpi’s publicly traded common stock during the class period from february   through and including december   the class excludes the defendants each of adpi’s officers directors subsidiaries and affiliates during the class period members of the defendants’ immediate families and their legal representatives heirs successors and assigns  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  any entity in which any of the foregoing have or had a controlling interest and the directors and officers liability insurance carriers and any affiliates or subsidiaries thereof of adpi also excluded from the class are any putative class members who exclude themselves by filing a request for exclusion in accordance with the requirements set forth in the notice to be provided to the class courts have long acknowledged the propriety of class certification for purposes of a class action settlement see in re community bank of northern va  fd   d cir  “‘all federal circuits recognize the utility of rule b settlement classes’ as a means to facilitate the settlement of complex nationwide class actions” quoting amchem prods inc v windsor  us    like any other class certification decision certification of a class for settlement purposes requires a determination that the requirements of rule  are met id specifically a class action must meet each of the four requirements set forth in rule a and at least one of three requirements set forth in rule b see fed r civ p b class certification is appropriate here because the action easily meets the requirements of rule a and rule b a the prerequisites of rule a are satisfied certification is appropriate under rule a if  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable  there are questions of law or fact common to the class  the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and  the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class fed r civ p a  the settlement class is sufficiently numerous class certification under rule a is appropriate where a class contains so many members that joinder of all would be impracticable while the exact number of class members  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  is unknown adpi’s  form k filed on march   discloses that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during  the first year of the class period was approximately  million and that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during  the last year of the class period was  million during the class period the average daily trading volume for adpi’s common stock was approximately  shares based on the foregoing it is reasonable to presume that the class consists of thousands of geographically dispersed members and thus the joinder of all members would be impracticable see in re transkaryotic therapies inc sec litig no civa rwz  wl  at  d mass nov   “other measures may be used to approximate class size for example ‘how many shares of stock were outstanding’ and ‘the average daily trading volume during the class period are both factors commonly considered by courts when finding the numerosity prong satisfied despite the absence of specific information about the number of individuals who purchased the stock during the relevant period’” citations omitted kinney v metro global media inc no civ a  ml  wl  at  dri aug   rejecting defendants’ contention that numerosity element was not satisfied and noting that “by sheer virtue of the fact that metro global stock was traded over the nasdaq small cap market during the class period over three years and that during that time thousands if not millions of the shares were traded common sense dictates that the proposed class is very large” accordingly the class is sufficiently numerous to satisfy rule a  there are common questions of law and fact federal securities cases like this one easily meet the commonality requirement of rule a because the claims of all class members arise from the same course of conduct by the  common stock this calculation was derived from publicly available information concerning the daily trading in adpi’s  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  defendants and involve the same legal theories rule a only requires “that questions of law or fact be shared by the prospective class but does not require that every question be common” kirby v cullinet software inc  frd   d mass  concluding that plaintiffs’ securities fraud claims raised common questions and granting motion for class certification further “‘the threshold of commonality is not a difficult one to meet’ especially when ‘there are a number of common issues of fact and law that the class members would be required to establish to prove the defendants’ liability as well as their entitlement to damages’” in re transkaryotic therapies inc  wl  at  here lead plaintiff’s claims against the defendants present many questions of law and fact which are common to all members of the class including • whether the defendants participated in and pursued the course of conduct described in the complaint • whether the defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and omissions were material • whether the defendants’ conduct violated sections b andor a of the exchange act • to what extent the class members have sustained damages that were caused by the defendants’ violations of the securities laws and • the proper measure of the damages sustained by members of the class thus the rule a commonality requirement is satisfied  the class representatives’ claims are typical of those of the settlement class rule a requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class” fed r civ p a “in general ‘a plaintiffs claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  claims of other class members and if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory’” in re transkaryotic therapies inc sec litig  wl  at  citation omitted however “as with the commonality requirement the typicality requirement does not mandate that the claims of the class representative be identical to those of the absent class members” swack v credit suisse first boston  frd   d mass  see also abelson v strong mdl no  civ a no s  wl  at  d mass july   “‘when it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented the typicality requirement is usually met’ seen in this light the burden on plaintiffs in proving typicality is not ‘very substantial’” citations omitted priest v zayre corp  frd   d mass  “‘with respect to typicality under rule a plaintiffs need not show substantial identity between their claims and those of absent class members but need only show that their claims arise from the same course of conduct that gave rise to the claims of the absent members’ ‘the question is simply whether a named plaintiff in presenting his case will necessarily present the claims of the absent plaintiffs’” citations omitted here the injuries to lead plaintiff and the members of the class are attributable to the same alleged course of conduct by the defendants and liability for this conduct is predicated on the same legal theories as such the rule a typicality requirement is satisfied  lead plaintiff and class counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class rule a is satisfied if “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class” fed r civ p a the court must measure the adequacy of representation by two standards  whether the plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified experienced and generally able to conduct the litigation and  whether the class representative has interests  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  antagonistic to those of the class in re transkaryotic therapies inc sec litig  wl  at  here class counsel has extensive experience and expertise in complex securities litigation and class action proceedings throughout the united states and is qualified and able to conduct this litigation – as they have demonstrated in drafting the complaint defeating the defendants’ motion to dismiss and negotiating the settlement moreover lead plaintiff and the class share the common goal of maximizing recovery and there is no conflict between them rule a is therefore satisfied b the class’s claims satisfy the prerequisites of rule b rule b authorizes class certification if “the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy” fed r civ p b these requirements are easily met in this case  common legal and factual questions predominate “classwide issues predominate if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member’s case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof” in re livent inc noteholders sec litig  frd   sdny  common issues predominate where “each class member is alleged to have suffered the same kind of harm pursuant to the same legal theory arising out of the same alleged course of conduct and the only individualized question concerns the amount of damages” in re transkaryotic therapies inc sec litig  wl  at  “where    common questions predominate regarding liability then courts generally find the predominance  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain” citation omitted the rule b test of predominance is “readily met” in securities fraud cases amchem prods  us at  see also randle v spectran  frd   d mass  holding that “common questions with respect to the existence and materiality of misleading statements or omissions in documents or press releases concerning corporation’s securities along with the related questions of defendants’ liability for such alleged statements or omissions predominate over any individual questions in this action” here all the class members’ claims against defendants are based on the same alleged course of conduct by the defendants there are numerous common issues relating to the defendants’ liability which predominate over any individualized issues the predominance requirement of rule b is therefore satisfied  a class action is superior to other methods of adjudication rule b sets forth the following nonexhaustive factors to be considered in making a determination of whether class certification is the superior method of litigation “a the class members’ interests in individually controlling the prosecution    of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by    class members c the desirability    of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and d the likely difficulties in managing a class action” fed r civ p b considering these factors this class action is clearly “superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication” of the claims of the vast number of purchasers of adpi stock lead plaintiff is unaware of any other litigation already commenced by individual class members which is not surprising given the tremendous costs associated with such litigation indeed courts in this circuit have concluded that the class action device in securities cases is usually the superior method by which to redress injuries to a large number of individual  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  plaintiffs swack  frd at  “the piecemeal adjudication of numerous separate lawsuits covering the same or substantially similar issuesie the defendants’ allegedly illegal conduct and the impact thereof on the market price of razorfish stockwould be an inefficient allocation of limited court resources” as one court has held absent the class action device “the very real risk is that potential class members with relatively small claims would not have the financial incentives or wherewithal to seek legal redress for their injuries” in re transkaryotic therapies inc sec litig  wl  at  the scope and complexity of lead plaintiff’s claims against defendants together with the massive cost of individualized litigation make it unlikely that the vast majority of the class members would be able to seek relief without class certification moreover it is clearly desirable to concentrate the claims of all class members in this forum and lead plaintiff does not foresee any difficulties in the management and settlement of this action as a class action accordingly the requirements of rule b are satisfied and the court should preliminarily certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed class iii the form and content of the proposed notice to the class are sufficient in order to afford class members the opportunity to object to a proposed classwide settlement reasonable notice must be provided to those class members durett v housing authority of city of providence  fd   st cir  where a proposed settlement is coupled with a request for class certification under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure class notice must meet the requirements of both rules c and e in terms of the form and manner of providing notice rule e instructs courts to “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal” while rule cb requires the notice to be the “best notice that is practicable  case cvrgs document  filed  page  of  under the circumstances including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort” “rule  does not require the parties to exhaust every conceivable method of identifying the individual class members” and “for those whose names and addresses cannot be determined by reasonable efforts notice by publication will suffice under rule c and under the due process clause” in re prudential ins co of am sales practices litig  frd   dnj  see also id at  “due process does not require actual notice but rather a good faith effort to provide actual notice” the content of a class notice in a securities class action is governed by rule cb and the private securities litigation reform act of  the “pslra” rule cb requires that the notice clearly and concisely state in plain easily understood language i the nature of the action ii the definition of the class certified iii the class claims issues or defenses iv that a class member may enter an appearance through an attorney if the member so desires v that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion vi the time and manner for requesting exclusion and vii the binding effect of a class judgment on members under rule c the pslra requires disclosure of the following additional information • the amount of the settlement proposed to be distributed to the parties to the action determined in the aggregate and on an average per share basis • if the parties do not agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged a statement from each settling party concerning the issue or issues on which the parties disagree • a statement indicating which parties or counsel intend to apply for an award of fees or costs from the settlement fund as well as the amount to be requested including on an average per share basis and a brief explanation supporting the fees and costs sought • the name

approval lead plaintiff has agreed to publish the publication notice in investor’s business daily to send the notice by firstclass mail to those members of the class whose addresses can be identified
