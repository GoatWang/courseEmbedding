page  of  in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts civil action no  ng magistrate judge judith gail dein l communications security and detection systems inc plaintiff v reveal imaging technologies inc defendant l’s objections to magistrate judge’s report and recommendation plaintiff l communications security and detection systems inc “l” respectfully objects to the proposed findings and recommendations set forth in the report and recommendation on plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and on defendant’s motion to stay andor quash di  in particular l objects to the recommendation that the summary judgment motion it filed on june  be denied without any consideration of its merits summary of argument l sued reveal imaging technologies inc “reveal” for patent infringement in august  after reveal engineered a series of procedural delays based on the unfounded assertion – ultimately withdrawn – that it had a dispositive defense discovery finally began in january on the merits of the infringement case the documentary evidence established without factual dispute the structure of reveal’s system as subsequently confirmed by reveal’s deposition testimony this system is covered by several claims in each of two l patents there is thus no genuine dispute that reveal infringes these patents accordingly l moved for summary judgment  case cvng document  filed  page  of  reveal refused to respond to the motion seeking instead to have it stayed its arguments for a stay were erroneous it argued first that it needed more discovery yet it failed to support this assertion with the required rule f affidavit or any equivalent information establishing what discovery it needed that could possibly alter the outcome indeed there is none inventor depositions would make no difference as the sole issue in dispute claim construction is one of law not fact which according the to the federal circuit turns on the patent’s own intrinsic evidence not on the inventors’ testimony secondly reveal erroneously claimed that a markman hearing must precede summary judgment motions on infringement both the federal circuit and the chief judge of this district have expressly held to the contrary accordingly there is no basis for further delay reveal should be required to respond to the dispositive motion so that the case can be expeditiously resolved on the merits procedural posture and background l instituted this patent infringement suit on august   di  originally asserting that reveal had infringed us patent no  by making and using a certain explosives detection system named “the ct” for use by airports and airlines in screening passenger baggage and cargo l served an amended complaint di  on september   alleging infringement of two additional patents us patent nos  “the ‘ patent” and  “the ‘ patent” these are the two patents that are the subject of  l subsequently served a second amended complaint di  on march   alleging infringement of three more patents us patent nos   and     case cvng document  filed  page  of  l’s june   motion for summary judgment of infringement rather than responding to the amended complaint reveal filed a motion to dismiss the entire action under rule b asserting that all of its infringing acts were immunized under  usc § see di  reveal refused to allow l to take any discovery on the § defense prior to filing an opposition even though virtually all facts concerning the defense were exclusively within reveal’s control see di  at ¶¶   in its opposition to the motion to dismiss di  l identified evidence of numerous uses of the ct that could not possibly be immunized under § reveal then backtracked and conceded that l was entitled to some discovery before the motion could be decided it refused to withdraw the motion to dismiss however and instead moved for a protective order that would effectively bring the case to a standstill except for discovery relating to its motion which it continued to claim would be dispositive of the entire case see di  in view of reveal’s representations and over l’s objections the magistrate judge allowed reveal’s motion and set a schedule for “limited discovery” and briefing on the motion di   on january   more than three months after reveal filed its motion to dismiss – and when l was finally poised to take its deposition reveal submitted a letter to the magistrate judge acknowledging that it had used the ct in a manner that was not immunized under § reveal had to have known of its own uses of the  a detailed discussion of the purpose and effect of  usc § is provided in l’s opposition to defendant’s rule b motion to dismiss di   for example reveal was engaged in sales efforts in europe yet admitted that its only manufacturing location was in the us thus reveal’s infringing acts in the us such as manufacturing the ct were plainly not solely for sale to the us government as reveal had claimed in its §  motion    case cvng document  filed  page  of  ct before it filed its motion and during the several months while the motion was pending since whether such uses occurred was the central issue raised by the motion in spite of this knowledge reveal had represented to the court that its motion to dismiss could be dispositive thereby delaying the start of discovery on the merits of the case for several months in january discovery finally opened on the core issue to be resolved in this case namely whether reveal’s product infringes as all the documentary evidence shows – and as reveal’s own deposition testimony confirmed – it plainly does indeed reveal’s deposition testimony concerning the structure and function of its ct system established that the aspects of the system relevant to the asserted claims of the ‘ and ‘ patents are not in dispute and are thus amenable to summary judgment l accordingly moved for partial summary judgment that reveal has infringed those patents see di  further confirming the absence of any genuine dispute l’s statement of undisputed facts di  relied exclusively on reveal’s own deposition testimony and documents to illustrate the relevant structure and manner of operation of the ct as noted in its memorandum di  at  the case law clearly holds that summary judgment should be granted one way or the other on infringement when the parties do not disagree about the structure of the accused product instead of responding to the motion however reveal filed a motion requesting that the summary judgment motion be stayed consistent with its ongoing strategy of attempting to delay the resolution of this case for as long as possible in the apparent hope of obtaining a foothold in the industry through the use of infringing technology  l had asked reveal in an interrogatory to state the basis for its noninfringement position if it had one reveal provided no substantive response    case cvng document  filed  page  of  reveal refused even to address the merits of the motion it did not identify any specific evidence whose discovery could or would help it show noninfringement or otherwise alter the outcome of the case it simply asked for leave to delay the day of reckoning until some much later time ironically reveal wrapped its request in rhetoric about l’s purported intent to use this litigation as a “tool” to harm a smaller competitor seemingly oblivious to the fact that it is l that is requesting that the case move promptly to a final resolution on the merits – a goal any party genuinely concerned with expense would presumably favor the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge was that reveal’s motion to stay be allowed it is respectfully suggested that this recommendation should not be adopted because it is based on reveal’s erroneous contentions regarding both federal circuit law regarding what is relevant to claim construction and first circuit law regarding the requirements for obtaining a delay under rule f the case is ripe for resolution and accordingly reveal should be required to file its opposition to l’s motion for summary judgment within a reasonable time so that it may be acted on argument for the reasons outlined below l’s summary judgment motion can and should be decided now if granted l’s motion would hasten the conclusion of this case obviating much time and expense reveal’s motion to stay rested on two legal errors first reveal argued that a lengthy markman claim construction process needs to be followed before the court can take up a dispositive motion addressing the issue of infringement onpoint case law both of the federal circuit and of this district is directly to the contrary    case cvng document  filed  page  of  second reveal suggested that a lengthy and complex discovery process needs to be followed before a summary judgment of infringement will be ripe again the law is unequivocally to the contrary the rule governing this issue – rule f – requires a party seeking to rely on its protections to first prove that a there is a particular item or category of evidence that it has been unable despite reasonable effort to obtain and b that this evidence would alter the outcome of the motion reveal neither met nor even attempted to meet either element of the test it did not even file a rule f affidavit as required to conform to that rule reveal’s entire argument on this issue was that it has not yet received some documents “from third party inventors” di  at  missing was any allegation let alone showing that such discovery could possibly change the outcome indeed it cannot since the question is not what the inventors might say in documents or even at their depositions but rather whether the product reveal makes is described by one or more claims set forth within the four corners of the patent itself reveal’s tactic once again is delay reveal had no answer when asked in an interrogatory why it does not infringe when confronted with a detailed summary judgment motion it still has no answer rule  exhorts the “just speedy and inexpensive determination” of actions and rule  is an important mechanism for doing so while rule f allows carefullydefined exceptions reveal’s motion failed to make even the most rudimentary attempt to meet the requirements of rule f i a markman hearing need not precede summary judgment rulings reveal argued that a formal markman claim construction hearing must precede resolution of l’s summary judgment motion on infringement markman itself is  reveal now has those documents    case cvng document  filed  page  of  directly to the contrary markman v westview instruments inc  fd   fed cir  en banc claim construction “ordinarily can be accomplished by the court in framing its charge to the jury but may also be done in the context of dispositive motions” emphasis added the federal circuit emphasized this more recently in ballard medical products v allegiance healthcare corp  fd  fed cir  in ballard the district court adjudicated the question of infringement on summary judgment because the intrinsic patent evidence resolved the key claim construction issues as a matter of law id at  on appeal the federal circuit rejected the argument that the district court was obliged to “conduct a detailed limitationbylimitation construction of each of the asserted claims” before issuing its summary judgment ruling contrary to ballard’s contention markman does not require a district court to follow any particular procedure in conducting claim construction it merely holds that claim construction is the province of the court not a jury to perform that task some courts have found it useful to hold hearings and issue orders comprehensively construing the claims in issue such a procedure is not always necessary however if the district court considers one issue to be dispositive the court may cut to the heart of the matter and need not exhaustively discuss all the other issues presented by the parties id emphasis added accordingly both the federal circuit and district courts – including the district of massachusetts – have repeatedly concluded that where there is no dispute about the structure or function of the accused product it is both appropriate and desirable to construe key claim limitations a matter of law for the court in the context of a summary judgment motion eg karlin technology inc v surgical dynamics inc  fd   fed cir  reversing district court’s grant of summary judgment of noninfringement and granting summary judgment of infringement after resolving    case cvng document  filed  page  of  disputed claim construction issue because structure of accused product was not contested biogen inc v berlex labs inc  f supp d   d mass  district court construed claims “in connection with” its decision on the parties’ summary judgment motions aff’d in part vacated in part on other grounds  fd  fed cir  indeed as chief judge young has explained a summary judgment motion on infringement is a “perfectly appropriate vehicle” for the task of resolving any claim construction issues that may arise mediacom corp v rates technology inc  fsuppd   dmass  noting that such issues are amenable to resolution “at a relatively early stage in the litigation” and that “from the standpoint of the litigants earlier is generally better” emphasis added thus although the court may indeed need to decide an issue of claim construction when it rules upon l’s motion assuming reveal’s defense is that the claims mean something other than what l believes they mean a whole separate markman process need not be followed to resolve these issues before a summary judgment motion is even briefed on the contrary the two are properly considered together reveal’s insistence that they must be broken out into separate phases is contrary to applicable law and seems calculated to delay reveal’s further arguments that l somehow “jumped the gun” on the case schedule by filing this motion were off the mark the motion was filed only after the parties had exchanged proposed claim constructions on the two patents at issue in accordance with the court’s april  order and after l had taken deposition testimony of reveal that established conclusively that the structure and function of the    case cvng document  filed  page  of  accused ct product met of the limitations of the asserted patent claims any claim construction issues relevant to this motion can be briefed as part of the motion and resolved in the court’s ruling on the motion ii l’s motion papers suffice to establish infringement reveal argued that l’s motion was not supported by affidavits but since the structure of reveal’s product is not disputed and since that structure is set forth in reveal’s documents and deposition testimony all of which are admissible evidence further affidavits are unnecessary as required by lr  l’s motion was accompanied by a concise statement of undisputed material facts that statement set forth the relevant details of reveal’s product and was fully supported by citations to the record neither the structure nor the function of the accused product the ct is contested the dispute is thus reduced to claim construction – a pure question of law see johnson worldwide associates inc v zebco corp  fd   fed cir  “because the relevant aspects of the accused device’s structure and operation are undisputed in this case the question of whether zebco’s autoguide product infringed the claims of johnson’s ‘ patent turns on the interpretation of those claims”  only after it was ordered to do so by the court see april  order ¶ and after leveraging a delay of more than a month reveal finally allowed l to take its deposition on the structure and function of its product the ct l obtained testimony at that deposition that established conclusively that all of the asserted claims of the ‘ and ‘ patents are infringed by the ct    case cvng document  filed  page  of  iii reveal has not made a rule f showing of need for further delay reveal argued citing rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure that it needs additional time to take fact discovery before it could respond to l’s motion infringement however is determined by comparing the structure or manner of operation of the accused product with the patents’ claims see eg johnson worldwide  fd at  reveal obviously needs no discovery as to the structure and function of its own product nor can reveal properly require discovery as to the meaning of the asserted patent claims the court should construe the claims by reference only to the “intrinsic” evidence of the patent which consists of the claims themselves the patent specification and the written prosecution history of the patent vitronics corp v conceptronics inc  fd   fed cir  only such evidence as is within the four corners of these documents all of which reveal has will bear on the meaning of the patent claim language it is thus inconsistent with applicable law for reveal to claim a need for discovery on this issue indeed reveal’s motion does not identify a single item of discovery that it would actually need from l to defend against l’s motion let alone do so in a sworn affidavit as required by rule f see fed r civ p f “should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the partys opposition the court may … order a continuance to permit … discovery to be had” under such circumstances the motion for a stay must be denied  the federal circuit yesterday reaffirmed the primacy of intrinsic evidence to claim construction in philips v awh corp  fd  july   en banc    case cvng document  filed  page  of  in the first circuit a party seeking additional time under rule f must be specific in explaining to the court not just what discovery it needs to adequately respond to a summary judgment motion but how that discovery would alter the outcome of the pending motion eg vargasruiz v golden arch dev inc  fd   st cir  “a petitioning party must offer the trial court more than optimistic surmise he must give the court reason to believe that undiscovered facts exist and that those facts if obtained would help defeat the pending motion” in addition the party must demonstrate a “realistic prospect that the facts can be obtained within a reasonable additional time and will if obtained suffice to engender an issue both genuine and material” patersonleitch co v mass mun wholesale elec co  fd   st cir  in this case reveal has met neither requirement reveal offered no explanation of what additional discovery might be needed it filed no affidavit as required by rule f critically it made no showing as to how any discovery it might obtain over the next several months would make any difference to the outcome of the summary judgment motion nor of course has it shown that it has made reasonable efforts to obtain such discovery and been unable to do so considering that it has not taken a single deposition in the nine months the case has been pending reveal could hardly meet that aspect of the test either as the first circuit has explained “a party departs from the plain language of rule f at his peril when a departure occurs the alternative proffer must simulate  reveal actually did notice over half a dozen depositions only to cancel them all at the last minute no doubt hoping to later argue – as it has now argued – that it needs more discovery    case cvng document  filed  page  of  the rule in important ways it should be made in written form and in a timely manner the statement must be made if not by affidavit then in some authoritative manner – say by the party under penalty of perjury or by written representations of counsel subject to the strictures of fedrcivp ” patersonleitch co v mass mun wholesale elec co  fd   st cir  reveal has done none of this the only hint it offers of what it could get from a rule f delay is that it says it plans to depose the inventors of the patentsinsuit but even if the court were to overlook the dispositive obstacle that rule f was not met notwithstanding first circuit authority to the contrary reveal has not even explained what evidence it hopes to discover by deposing individual inventors of the patentsinsuit let alone how that evidence would alter the outcome of the pending motion indeed such evidence cannot alter the outcome here the testimony of inventors is considered to be particularly irrelevant to the issue of claim construction markman  fd at  “the subjective invent of the inventor when he used a particular term is of little or no probative weight in determining the scope of a claim except as documented in the prosecution history” vitronics  fd at  “nor may the inventor’s subjective intent as to claim scope when unexpressed in patent documents have any effect” bell  howell document management products co v alteck systems  fd   fed cir  “the testimony of an inventor and his attorney concerning claim construction is … entitled to little or no consideration” in any event as l pointed out in its summary judgment brief at  the words in the    case cvng document  filed  page  of  patents are not so divorced from any plain meaning that extrinsic evidence would be needed to construe the claims finally reveal argued that summary judgment motions should not be filed “seriatim” but that is not what l is doing if the pending motion is granted and reveal is found to infringe the case could effectively be resolved indeed in the case reveal cites golden trade srl v lee apparent co  wl  sdny  the problem was that the movant waited too long until two years after the deadline to file a summary judgment motion here l has filed the motion promptly in the hope of expediting the final resolution of the action  if reveal actually could show that a particular deposition was critical to the outcome then at most the dispositive motion should be delayed long enough for that deposition to be taken l can make its witnesses available forthwith indeed it did so but reveal cancelled their depositions there is no need for a fourmonth delay    case cvng document  filed  page  of  conclusion for the above reasons l respectfully objects to the magistrate judge’s recommendation and requests that reveal’s motion to stay be denied and that reveal be ordered to respond to l’s motion for partial summary judgment forthwith july   respectfully submitted l
