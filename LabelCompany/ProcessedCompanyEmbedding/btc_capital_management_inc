customer as well as oracle’s opportunity in the saas market oracle’s opportunity in cloud and saas and valuation have been the main area of investor pushback since our upgrade as oracle continues to execute on its cloud transition we believe multiple expansion can continue key investment points oracle on average could see x the revenue from a customer who moves its workload from onpremise to the cloud transitions at autodesk and adobe showed lifetime customer value driven from the cloud is much higher than from onpremise as oracle moves its customers to the cloud it should gain a similar benefit for the customer migrating to the cloud can lead to significant overall cost savings based on labor and hardware costs needed to manage onpremise solutions   according to zacks investment research oracle has outperformed the sp  on a yeartodate basis the companys offerings in saas and paas have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters which improves competitive position
