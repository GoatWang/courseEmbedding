as described love glad i took a chance with this line will buy again date published  rated  out of  by snwwhit from batting balls up when washed the batting inside bunch all upvery disappointingi had hoped this wouldnt happen with a name brand item date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from very satisfied beautiful set very glad i ordered this it even made our old brass bed look good good quality soft and generously sized well have this set for many years thank you scott living and qvc date published  rated  out of  by love the mountains from soft but  pillows dont match very well ive waited for years to buy a new bedding set for my masters bedroom and for some reason i chose this one probably because the scott brothers were so entertaining during their segment this bedding set is very soft no smell issues like others said at all it is a light comforter which is perfect for this montana home during the warmer months the one issue i have with this is the two larger throw pillows do not really coordinate as they are more taupe and the rest of the set is more grey i will not be using these and will look for more grey pillows to complement the rest of the set and the one pillow in front truly not a biggy but it would have been nice if the two pillows matched more exactly grey and taupe are not my idea of complementary colors thanks scott brothers though for this nice bedding set though date published  rated  out of  by joy from absolutely beautiful i purchased the biolan in the king size for a queen size mattress i have a thick featherbed and wanted the comforter to look like a bedspread the fit is perfect living in the southwest i wanted touches of turquoise and dark coral but i didnt want a true southwest design the biolan design is classy with just the right amount of color for accent i was concerned the comforter may be too warm during the summer but with the air conditioning its comfortable i consider this a lightweight comforter and im happy with that because i hate having anything heavy on me while sleeping i will not use the navy throw pillows the material is like a faux suede and doesnt look good with the set the smaller pillow looks nice i have white walls in my bedroom and the biolan has a white background hard to tell from the pictures so this set looks like it was custom made for me thanks guysgood job date published  rated  out of  by bjglace from nice but underwhelming the comforter is very pretty material is thin will need to take it off at night as our dog sleeps with us has a funny smell but hope it goes away since it is now out of the plastic date published  rated  out of  by r in va from its ok the comforters fabric is very thin if you have a dog that lays on the bed dont get it i am sure it will rip i love the colors and wanted something very colorful for summer i was excited to get throw pillows with it but the navy background does not go with any color in the comforter i am not using them on the bed yes i am a libra and like things balanced lol i am not sending it back but not very thrilled about it i guess i expected more with these guys name on it but then again i guess i would be paying more too date published  y

community qa scott living  piece king coverlet set is rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by ncsmca from great coverlet love the fabric and design i just ordered a second color taupe to go with the coral tsv sheets the seaglass works well with the lattice sheets i too am disappointed in the shams hoping they were quilted as well  the zipper is difficult to use it is hard to find a good quality coverlet  date published  rated  out of  by pagerus from perfect beautiful coverlet i ordered the coverlet in two colors to see which one i like better with the seattle bedding from the scott brothers which is absolutely gorgeous by the way i got the creamy white and seablue green love them both but think i will keep the creamy white i would love to keep both but cant justify doing that the seablue green coverlet is gorgeous but doesnt exactly match the bedding as it does on the video the way i would like it too i know you dont have to match exactly but i kind of like to plus my curtains are white so it ties it all together the coverlets are fabulous quality and look expensive like hotel bedding but better im now a bigger scott brothers fan i have ordered their comforter coverlet sheets and towels and all high quality at much less cost doing the happy dance for the scott brothers date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from shams received the sea glass coverlet and shams i have a california king size bed and got the king size coverlet set and to my surprise it fit beautifully on my bed and around the sides its very generous all the other coverlet sets that ive purchased in the past barely cover the sides of my bed the shams are not quilted as the bed coverlet they feel very much like a pillow case thats why i gave it minus one star the cases for the pillow come with a zipper on the top or bottom depending on how you place it on the bed and its not noticeable they glide over nicely but you need to use both hands one to hold the other to zip i understand that these are pillow shams but was expecting it to match the coverlet quilt at least on one side date published  y m d h bvseobulk prodbvrr vnbulkhotfix cp bvpage cohasreviews tv tr loc sidh prod
