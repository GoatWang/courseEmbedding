acres of forestland in north america as of june    of this area is public land in canada managed through longterm forest management arrangements that include a public input process and regular

criticized by greenpeace and other organizations for advancing logging and road building in endangered species habitat in québec and ontario on  may  resolute forest products joined  other organizations including greenpeace canada and the david suzuki foundation to become a founding member of the canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa the agreement formalizes the members’ commitments to conserving vast areas of forests and enabling the legislated protection of largescale areas that are needed to preserve threatened species such as woodland caribou claiming a lack of progress on delivering results within the cbfa particularly on the creation of protected areas and caribou conservation plans greenpeace canada and canopy two founding signatories departed the agreement in december  and april  respectively other environmental organizations suspended work with resolute on may   announcing that resolute will not do the minimum that the science says is required to protect our forests and the threatened caribou that call them home greenpeace canada released a report examining resolutes sustainability claims in may  alleging that the company is deceiving customers about the sustainability of their forestry operations and their interactions with communities first nations and workers greenpeace withdrew an earlier criticism of resolute forest products on  march  noting that a december  campaign against the company “incorrectly stated that resolute had breached the canadian boreal forest agreement” on may   resolute filed a  defamation lawsuit against greenpeace canada and two of its staff in ontario superior court alleging the organization interfered with economic relations with their customers in response greenpeace launched a legal defense fund and characterized the lawsuit as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp in september  the ontario superior court dismissed resolutes defamation action on the grounds it was designed to greatly expand the scope of the litigation and transform the trial into an inquiry into greenpeace the logging company responded saying the court decision does not in any way diminish the claims against greenpeace of defamation and intentional interference with commercial relations in may  resolute filed a  milliondollar lawsuit in atlanta georgia using the united states rico act which is primarily for fighting organized crime and racketeering against greenpeace the complaint alleges that the environmental group is a global fraud that is tricking people in both the usa and around the world into donating millions of dollars based on materially false and misleading claims about its purported environmental purpose and its “campaigns” against targeted companies in january  greenpeace asked a court in georgia for the case to be dismissed on the grounds that rico is simply an intimidation tactic that would set a dangerous precedent if successful because resolute is trying to silence critics of its logging practices in canadas boreal forests in june  several major book publishers including penguin random house and harpercollins have had to respond to resolutes rico action after a petition which was signed by more than  authors in support of greenpeace was presented at bookexpo  the usas publishing trade show the petitions signatories are concerned that rico  in this particular

compared million in the fourth quarter of  our results were supported by higher prices in our wood product segment and significantly lower unplanned maintenance expenses when compared to the previous quarter on the other hand higher costs related to seasonally higher energy expenses sga adjustment and lower volume mainly in newsprints negatively impacted our financial performance by segment we generated adjusted ebitda of  million in market pulp an improvement of  million against the previous quarter  million from our tissue operations  million in wood products compared to  million in q  in newsprint down by  million and  million in specialty papers up by  million even as demand declines continue in our paper segments and unfair trade action on supercalendered paper negatively affected our cash position we will report improvements in segments focussed on growth markets namely pulp wood product and tissue which collectively generated an increase in ebitda of  million when compared to q in our pulp segments we experienced a reduction in unplanned downtime which allowed us to reduce cost despite several price increase announcements throughout the quarter pricing was only up slightly compared to the fourth quarter in tissue we had achieved important milestones first we successfully started out our new machine at calhoun nearly a month ahead of our original schedule we are now able to support our sales efforts with our own product samples and will be in a better position to compete in the retail business bidding cycle at atlas we are also making progress by delivering positive ebtida this quarter as for our wood product business it continued to demonstrate very solid results thanks to strong pricing in part due to market expectation of countervailing duties on export in our paper segments market conditions continue to deteriorate which led to the permanent closure of mokpo and the indefinite idling of thorold during the quarter nevertheless our speciality paper segment benefitted from lower maintenance and chemical cost which led to an increase in ebitda despite reduction in pricing let’s review our individual segments starting with market pulp world demand for chemical pulp grew by  in the quarter compared to the same period of  demand in china and north america rose  and  respectively while western europe declined by  specifically for softwood kraft demand increased by  globally with china rising  north america  and western europe declining  operating rates were solid in the quarter for softwood kraft mills reaching  for hardwood grades we saw global demand growth of  entirely due to china which recorded an increase of  during the quarter compared to q of  demand in north america and western europe both declined by  and  respectively after falling during the fourth quarter of  our realized pricing gradually increased from the lows of last december reversing the trend and resulting in a small increase over the fourth quarter average pricing our maintenance improvement efforts resulted in lower overall cost reduction in unplanned repair led to a  million reduction in costs for the segment however total shipments fell by  metric tons due in part to catawba annual maintenance shutdown taking place at the end of march in the first quarter total tissue consumption in the us grew by  against the same period last year away from home shipments increased  while at home volume grew  at atlas our volume growth of  was entirely driven by parent rolls and we achieved a positive ebitda for the segment in the quarter one of the highlights was the start up of our calhoun integrated tissue operation the facility started production in structure mode which not only represent a world first of this technology but also allowed us to produce premium products right from the start the tissue machine is manufacturing quality products from how to indiscernible internally supply pulp we are now focused on ramping up production and accelerating sales we have firm orders with important retailers which will be shipped in the coming quarters growth in the us housing market continued in the first quarter overall seasonally adjusted housing start in the us rose by  with single family starts increasing by  on average when compared to the fourth quarter new home sales also increased significantly rising  on average when compared to q influenced by market expectations on softwood lumber duties market pricing rose during the quarter our overall realized price in the segment increased by  to thousand board feet compared to the fourth quarter despite adverse weather condition our shipments exceeded half a billion board feet for the third consecutive quarter our profitability was impacted by higher log cost and production curtailment overall ebitda was  million for the quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter and only  million in the first quarter of  the us department of commerce imposed countervailing duties of  on the company’s export of softwood lumber effective april  we find this decision to be baseless ignoring the regulatory changes made in quebec forestry system in  making it the market base and that indiscernible nafta panel ruling confirming the absence of sub cities in ontario residual system we expect that the final duty of termination will recognize these elements north american demand from newsprint fell by  in the first quarter compared to the same period of  exports declined  over the same period as global demand went down  even as north american consumption continues to decline the industry production to capacity ratio was  our newsprint shipments fell by  metric tonnes when compared to the fourth quarter and this reduction is mostly explained by the permanent closure of mokpo and the definitive idling of thorold pricing slid by  per metric ton during the quarter which was mainly attributable to our export business and the weakness of global currencies against the us dollars the other root cause in the segment rose by  per metric ton compared to the previous quarter this was mostly the result of lower volumes and higher distribution and energy costs which were partially offset by lower maintenance and a reduction in fixed cost this led to a reduction in ebitda of  million down to  million north american demand for uncoated mechanical papers was down by  in the quarter compared to the same period last year markets for supercalendered papers led this decline dropping  while other uncoated grades fell  industry production fell  compared to  this resulted in a shipment to capacity ratio of  for the quarter market conditions in coated mechanical grades continue to deteriorate north american demand fell  during the quarter compared to the same period last year imports also fell by  over the same period and north american production declined by  resulting in a shipment to capacity ratio of  our overall segment pricing fell by  per short ton when compared to the fourth quarter of  impacted by a reduction in demand in supercalendered and coated grades however our shipment increased by  short tons compared to q mostly in white paper products the combination of this increased volume and a reduction in our delivered cost of  per short ton due to lower maintenance and chemical cost offset by seasonally higher energy expenses resulted in an increase ebtida of  million compared to the fourth quarter to  million i will now let joann discuss our financial performance before i conclude with our priorities and outlook joann longworth good morning everyone today we reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter or  per share excluding special items this compared to a net loss excluding special items of  million in the previous quarter and a net loss excluding special items of  million for the same period last year special items included startup costs of  million associated with the calhoun tissue project  million of closure cost for mokpo and  million in stores inventory write down associated with the closure total sales in the first quarter were  million  million below the fourth quarter overall pricing positively impacted our results by  million primarily in lumber where prices rose by  per thousand board feet while our market pulp pricing rose by  per metric ton our three other segments stock pricing declined of  per short ton in tissue primarily due to an increase in parent roll sales  per metric ton in newsprint and  per short ton in speciality papers shipments of wood products and speciality papers increased by  million board feet and  short tons respectively in tissue volumes rose by  short tons resulting from higher sales of parent rolls which represented  of our shipments in the quarter up from  in q more than offsetting these gains were reductions in pulp of  metric tons resulting in part from the annual outage at catawba and by  metric tons in newsprint mostly due to the capacity disclosure excluding foreign currency and volume impacts our costs of goods sold was essentially unchanged from q we saw a  million decrease in maintenance cost reflecting improved productivity and reduced repair a  million reduction in pension and other post retirement benefit expense mostly due to lower interest cost resulting from the decrease in discount rates at the end of  and a  million reduction in chemical cost which were mostly offset by a  million seasonal increase in energy pricing and consumption a  million rise in startup cost associated with the calhoun tissue project and a  million increase in log and recycled fiber cost market pulp all in delivered cost was down by  per metric ton largely because of lower maintenance expenses resulting in an increase in ebitda of  to  per metric ton our progress at atlas continued to yield results with increased shipments of short ton of parent roll and ebitda of  million for the quarter the increase in cost of  per short ton was due to favourable adjustments in depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter in wood products the delivered cost rose by  per thousand board feet due largely to higher log cost and production curtailments nevertheless higher prices pushed ebitda up  per thousand board feet to  newsprints delivered cost rose by  per metric ton to  this is mostly explained by lower production higher freight and energy cost which were partially offset by lower maintenance and fixed cost ebitda per metric ton fell from  to  in specialty papers the delivered cost fell by  per short ton mostly driven by lower maintenance and chemical costs partially offset by seasonally higher energy expense leading to an increased ebitda per short ton of  to  despite a reduction in realized prices we spend  million in capital expenditures in the quarter  million of which was dedicated to the calhoun tissue project we anticipate that the total cost of the project will be about  million nevertheless we will meet our overall  capex target of  million as previously disclosed during the quarter we used  million of cash in operations mostly due to an increase in inventories in our wood product segment when combined with our capital spending this resulted in additional net borrowings of  million from our revolving credit facility during the quarter our debt as on march  was  million with the cash position of  million and total availability under our credit facilities of  million liquidity at the end of the quarter remained solid at  million we made contributions to our pension and opeb plans totalling  million in the quarter which resulted in a  million reduction in the net pension and opeb liability on our balance sheet during the first quarter the company reached an agreement with the province of ontario with respect to capacity reduction contributions under that provinces special funding relief regulations we are no longer required to make any further contributions in respect of capacity reductions in ontario that occurred after april   consequently contributions to the affected pension plans will be lower by approximately  million in  and  million in  in addition estimated contributions to our québec pension plans from  to  are expected to be lower than previously disclosed by approximately  million including  million for this year based on the exchange rate in effect on march   our total pension contributions are expected to decline by approximately  million in  compared to  and a further  million between  and  slide  reflect these changes and provides greater clarity on the timing of our  contributions i will now turn it over to richard for concluding remark richard garneau so before we’ll discuss our market outlook i would like to report on our four priorities for this year but first we make progress business in our tissue business and we’re pleased with the startup of our tissue machine at calhoun starting equipment ph of this complexity can bring unexpected difficulties all employees have embraced the challenge in the product we currently manufacture meets our expectations at this point in the rampup in the case of atlas we’ve generated positive ebitda this quarter and have increased our focus to improve sales going forward we only made progress improving equipment reliability which translated into lower maintenance costs particularly in our market pulp segments our capital spending for  will be centered on maintenance of business and the completion of the calhoun tissue project we will meet our previously disclosed target of a  million for the year and finally as i pointed out that we are disappointed with the countervailing duties recently imposed on our softwood lumber exports we support the measures taken by the québec government who responded to industry and community needs we also applaud the principal statements made by canadian federal ministers freeland and carl who declared that the trade actions were unfair and unwarranted we look forward to continuing to work with interactive stakeholders to ensure that québec and ontario lumber industries are recognize as free subsidies and deserve unencumbered access to the us market our market outlook remains unchanged from last quarter in pulp we are confident that the favorable market we are experiencing will continue until at least mid year and possibly into the second half we also expect to see stronger price realizations in the coming two quarters as announce price – less price increases in excess of  per metric ton or realized net of discount in tissue our manufacturing focus will be to continue to ramp up production but the key to all success will be in our marketing and sales effort not that we can offer a full complement of our integrated tissue and powder products we believe that customer will be increasingly receptive to all offering we will continue to promote our green heritage and harmony brands and actively pursue bid cycle opportunities with us retailers in lumber we expect steady increases housing starts for the foreseeable future however we anticipate shortterm volatility in the market cause by the imposition of us trade barriers in our paper rates we expect the ongoing demand decline to continue at the similar pace both domestically and offshore where currencies will continue to handicap the competitiveness of all us mills we are committed to positioning our network to compete effectively this concludes our formal presentation operator we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question is from hamir patel cibc capital markets please go ahead hamir patel sure i want to get your thoughts on how lumber prices in canada might see relative to the us when duties are in effect because i under during lumber four there was discount of the benchmark but curious what you think that may be in this current environment richard garneau well there was no doubt that we’re going to  unfortunately i see a discount in the canadian market so the tax the countervailing tax imposed on the export is going to force more volume in canada and more volume in canada means that were going probably to see the canadian market to be oversupply and we knew when there was more supply and demand the impact on pricing hamir patel great thanks it’s helpful i know québec has spoken about giving loan guarantees and i may have missed this if this is kind of reported in the french press what exactly is the québec government going to be doing to support the sawmilling industry richard garneau well the program has been while the premier has indicated his intention to help the communities and the industry so we were expecting that we’ll have to see the loans that could be offered volume indiscernible québec at market conditions depending its what i heard depending of the credit how strong your credit is so i think that to make sure that its not countervailable that is not going to taxable so québec has put us in this program basically some strong production to make sure that its going to be recognized as market so it means that they continue with this weaker credit is going to be more like it is now with commercial bank so the premier has been very supportive and i think that indiscernible i think the premier has this strong position to held the communities and they has assisted also on the fact that québec has an auction system that is market and has been strongly critical of the benchmark that has been use by commerce to determine the duty rates hamir patel thanks for that richard thats all i had i’ll turn it over richard garneau thank you operator operator instructions and we have a question from the line of paul quinn with rbc capital markets please go ahead paul quinn yes thanks very much and good morning richard richard garneau good morning paul quinn just had a couple questions one on softwood lumber i know you expect the rate to be zero but given the politics of the file what was your expectation on the preliminary cvd did it come in the range that you thought and your discount offs some of the western producers is that the amount that you guys were kind of expecting richard garneau well the – i was expecting sort of a lower rate than that i was expecting that the auction system in québec would be use and as you’re probably aware they use nova scotia as a benchmark benchmark that apparently cannot be verified and its confidential what i knew at this point looking at the details of how they came to the margin commerce came to the margin they didn’t basically use – there is variance of  million so they have under estimated our stumpage and really that caused by  million so our margin should be lower than that and also they had also countervail power so green power that is not at all use into the manufacture of the lumber so i think that i’m confident while assuming that there is no politics i’m confident that our rate is going to be significantly lower by one they come with the final determination paul quinn okay and then from the last time that we saw this final determination rates came down through litigation over time but it seemed to take at least two years do you expect the same timeline on litigation on the file to be able to ultimately reduce the final rate richard garneau well i think that we have obviously to wait for the final determination so i think that certainly we will have an opportunity to verification to have discussion with the commerce auditors so the discrepancies that i just referred to are going to be taken into account i can tell you that it’s going to reduce the rate i think that we certainly going to have discussion on a green power in quebec it’s not related to lumber at all so when you look at trade laws ph and the statutes and regulations so i think that it’s not defensible and i think that the other one is the benchmark so nova scotia wood or timber is completely different from québec and ontario and i think that we have vetted ph system auction system more than royalty ph it’s in fact ahead slightly over  of the wood in québec that is sold through auction or brought from private timber land owner so i think that we should certainly see the final determine the reduction and i think that i would like to mention that back in  i knew it’s a long time ago but the residual value system in the field was to determine that they are were no subsidies so i think its matter of – certainly a matter of discussion certain discussions that we’re going to have between now and the final determination and before we talk about litigation so i think we have wait and final determination is probably going to november so we’ll have to live with these uncertainties for some months paul quinn okay and then if i can just move on to pulp here we were kind of disappointed with your realization in the quarter wondering if theres anything unusual and then second part is you described china growth is i think you had it at  i’m just wondering how sustainable you think that is going forward joann longworth hi paul it’s joann on the pulp pricing in q the issue there is it bit complicated but you had prices rising in the fourth  sorry decreasing in the fourth quarter rising in the first quarter so if you average them out the comparison unfortunately this is not a strong as what actually occurred during the first quarter and secondly you’ve got lags on the pricing in certain of our contract of a month to two months so we are expecting that the several price announcements we made in the first quarter we’ll see the bulk of that in the second and third quarter richard garneau and paul when i look at december and march so we saw an increase of  and its lag so i think that in the second quarter we’re going to basically get benefit of the price increase net of the discount paul quinn okay and then just a reference to that china growth almost  and the global growth that you pointed out over  how sustainable do you think that is going forward i mean a number of analysts including myself expected pulp pricing to come down to get to the capacity additions coming forward and that thing that we got sort of  we werent quite aware of is the significant growth in china and other places do you think thats sustainable richard garneau well it’s a very difficult to forecast as you know we all thought that we would see a very slow growth in china in the first quarter and we were all surprised so certainly trying to forecast what they  how much they’re going to buy and consume forward is very difficult but what i could say i think that there is certainly now we’re going to enter into more downtime annual maintenance downtime certainly in north america and i think the other factor paul that you aware is that our large new pulp mill didn’t start as fast and we know how difficult it on to startup equipment and to get up to the design capacity and get the quality so i think that and well certainly when i look at it for the second quarter and maybe the third that we’re going to continue to see a strong number so i think that there is probably its a subconscious optimism here if i can see but i think the pulp market is certainly increasing paul quinn okay and just lastly turning to newsprint  you described the operating array at  for the industry what is that for resolute and weve also seen because of the sort of weakening price at wescare weve seen a price increase announcement from norpac and others and whats the pricing situation in the east coast richard garneau well it’s certainly under pressure with the demand decline and i think that now with the price increase announcement in the west so i was getting closer in terms of pricing between the east and west i think that this  so what’s reflect the machine closure a permanent closure that happened indiscernible with all in other companies also that their capacity out and converted that to other products so i think that normally at  and the reason that we put that in our script is that  you should see stable pricing and well in the past at  ph we the industry enjoyed price increase but i think that to the indiscernible down what we had in the past and i think that with the decline its continue to decline  per year so its only going to force the industry to supply and demand – to adjust the supply to a demand paul quinn excellent thanks richard and joann and look forward to improvement in q thank you richard garneau sure thank you joann longworth thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i’ll turn the call back over to the presenters richard garneau thank you for joining us today

in québec and ontario on  may  resolute forest products joined  other organizations including greenpeace canada and the david suzuki foundation to become a founding member of the canadian boreal forest agreement cbfa the agreement formalizes the members’ commitments to conserving vast areas of forests and enabling the legislated protection of largescale areas that are needed to preserve threatened species such as woodland caribou claiming a lack of progress on delivering results within the cbfa particularly on the creation of protected areas and caribou conservation plans greenpeace canada and canopy two founding signatories departed the agreement in december  and april  respectively other environmental organizations suspended work with resolute on may   announcing that resolute

claims in may  alleging that the company is deceiving customers about the sustainability of their forestry operations and their interactions with communities first nations and workers greenpeace

lawsuit in atlanta georgia using the united states rico act which is primarily for fighting organized crime and racketeering against greenpeace the complaint alleges that the environmental group is a global fraud that is tricking people in both the usa and around the world into donating millions of dollars based on materially false and misleading claims about its purported environmental purpose and its “campaigns” against targeted companies in january  greenpeace asked a court in georgia for the case to be dismissed on the grounds that rico is simply an intimidation tactic that would set a dangerous precedent if successful because resolute is trying to silence critics of its logging practices in canadas boreal forests in june  several major book publishers including penguin random house and harpercollins have had to respond to resolutes rico action after a petition which was signed by more than  authors in support of greenpeace was presented at bookexpo  the usas publishing trade
