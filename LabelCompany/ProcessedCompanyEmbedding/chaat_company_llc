we are indian and american indian food has rarely been considered cool in a culture bursting with energy color and tradition we only tend to see it expressed in poorlylit taj mahalthemed restaurants slinging allyoucaneat buffets we’re on a mission to shock the standards of indian cuisine armed with its bold street snacks chaat is fresh it’s alive with crunch and spice and tang it hits with the flavor impact of a tornado it’s unlike any other cuisine in the world and it’s been around for thousands of years it’s a bite against boredom and we’d like to share it with you anshu dua cofounder my very first memory is of frantically running down the stairs of my home in chandigarh and squeezing my way onto a crowded rickshaw i was  years old and i had no fear along with fifteen other kids sitting on wooden boards hanging off the ends this was my school bus i was born in india but in the early ’s my parents packed all their possessions into eight very large suitcases and with my older sister we flew to america on a pan am jumbo jet my story anshu dua cofounder my very first memory is of frantically running down the stairs of my home in chandigarh and squeezing my way onto a crowded rickshaw i was  years old and i had no fear along with fifteen other kids sitting on wooden boards hanging off the ends this was my school bus i was born in india but in the early ’s my parents packed all their possessions into eight very large suitcases and with my older sister we flew to america on a pan am jumbo jet we learned to adapt to our new country and i became an american kid i watched mtv tried to understand the rules of football ate filetofish sandwiches no beef in our house drove everywhere in our light blue station wagon occasionally i forgot where i was during my kindergarten entrance test the teacher pointed to a number of objects that i had to vocally identify in english we got through the first few piece of cake then she pointed to a paper bag and i instinctively screamed out “lafafa” – the hindi equivalent – only to quickly correct myself hoping my chances of going to school weren’t dashed true story my parents still tell to this day with a laugh and a hint of pride i was clinging to my roots being immigrants meant we spent our summer vacations back in india our entire summer vacation my parents insisted it was important to keep in touch with our culture our heritage our language our extended family but to me it meant goodbye to icecream sundaes with extra hot fudge barbecues alldaynintendo marathons roller coasters at disney and sleepovers i wanted to be with my american friends and do summertime american things then suddenly i had a career business cards with a long title hippie startup tshirts stock options venture capital frenemies elevator pitches — many elevator pitches exit strategies yes life in the fast lane neurons started firing about those summers many years ago lazy chess matches with my grandfather frantically running up to the roof to clear the clothesline before the impending monsoon riding on my uncle’s scooter to pick up fresh samosas  jalebis for afternoon chai badminton endless badminton trying to speak hindi kite fights on the roof with the neighbors google it i missed it i needed to reconnect to climb back on that rickshaw this is my way shiraz noor cofounder my greatest memories are of food it wasn’t some sort of destiny it started if you can imagine with the launch of the food network which lured me away from cartoons at a young age i watched david rosengarten sara moulton and bobby flay i watched emeril lagasse religiously bam i knew better than any year old i’ve ever known who i was and what i wanted to be my story shiraz noor cofounder my greatest memories are of food it wasn’t some sort of destiny it started if you can imagine with the launch of the food network which lured me away from cartoons at a young age i watched david rosengarten sara moulton and bobby flay i watched emeril lagasse religiously bam i knew better than any year old i’ve ever known who i was and what i wanted to be my parents were good cooks and i always tried to help them as a means to bolster my education we cooked a lot of indian food though my mum from singapore also dabbled in chinese they were usually in a rush to get something on the table so for extra credit on weekends i would go over to my aunt’s house and cook with her my dad’s eldest sister did not cook mainly indian like her siblings she made lasagna fish even burgers on the th of july really crazy stuff like that my fate was sealed the first time i walked into the kitchen of a finedining restaurant in singapore that my cousin had an interest in she’d convinced the frenchtrained chef to babysit a year old who was technically on summer vacation on my first day i rolled out pasta on my second i shucked oysters by my third i never wanted to leave i forwent college in favor of culinary school with  restaurant summer jobs under my belt i secured an internship at then the  restaurant in the world the fat duck i came to new york city and cooked at the gramercy tavern i studied wine and cocktails and service working through eleven madison park and blue hill at stone barns i worked every restaurant position i possibly could all the way up to general manager and i realized that i didn’t know who i was or what i wanted to be soon after on a visit to my parents we ate an indian meal at the table i grew up at and for the first time in my life i devoured it not wishing there was also a steak or fries or sushi and i got to
