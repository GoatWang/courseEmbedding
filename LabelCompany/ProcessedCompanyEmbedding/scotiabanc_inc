semiannual update credit opinion bank of nova scotia rating action moodys downgrades canadian banks rating action moodys places bank of nova scotias ratings under review global credit research   nov  toronto november    moodys investors service has placed the long term ratings counterparty risk assessment and baseline credit assessment of bank of nova scotia bns aaaa negative a and its subsidiaries on review for downgrade and affirmed bnss prime shortterm deposit rating shortterm counterparty risk assessment and other short term ratings the impacted entities are listed below bank of nova scotia bank of nova scotia houston branch bank of nova scotia new york agency montreal trust company of canada scotiabank capital trust scotiabanc inc scotiabank europe plc scotiabank tier  trust ratings rationale moodys said the review was prompted by bns having taken significant measures to increase its profitability that signal a fundamental shift away from the banks traditionally low risk appetite these strategic actions are intended to enhance current profitability bns reports the lowest domestic net interest margin of the six largest canadian banks but in moodys view increase the prospect of future incremental credit losses when the credit cycle turns over the last two years bns has accelerated the growth in its credit card and auto finance portfolios in accordance with its strategic initiatives to expand these portfolios both of which are particularly prone to rapid deterioration during an economic shock and exhibit higher defaults and loss severities than mortgage portfolios personal and credit cards loans grew at a cagr of  over the past two years the highest among the six large canadian peer banks in addition bns has made a series of acquisitions away from its strong domestic franchise towards highergrowth but less stable international markets during the review period moodys will review the likelihood that bnss increased risk tolerance and strategic imperative to increase profitability by shifting the asset mix towards higher yielding categories of consumer credit both domestically and in international operations will persist moodys will also undertake further analysis of the operating environments of the regions outside of canada where bns operates and the banks strategy and performance in these regions moodys will also assess the implications of the shift in risk tolerance balanced against the strategic plan to enhance profitability and shareholder returns given the direction of the review upward pressure on the rating is

release was corrected as follows the following sentence was added to the first paragraph of the press release “the rationale for the affirmation of these ratings is the continuation of their key strengths superior asset quality and strong stable earnings capacity supported by a stable operating environment” the following was added as the second paragraph of the ratings rationale section “the canadian banks are very highly rated and there is little prospect for upward movement in their ratings at this time the following factors would result in downward ratings pressure i a significant deterioration in the operating environment ii a significant increase in consumer loan losses andor iii a significant change in business mix resulting in increased reliance upon capital markets earnings andor earnings from less well positioned international operations” revised release follows toronto april    moodys investors service has today affirmed the longterm ratings on the six largest canadian banks and two other deposittaking issuers as well as the negative outlook for the supported senior debt and uninsured deposit ratings of seven of those financial institutions the rationale for the affirmation of these ratings is the continuation of their key strengths superior asset quality and strong stable earnings capacity supported by a stable operating environment although moodys very high systemic support assumptions remain unchanged the negative rating outlooks reflect the possibility it may reduce its systemic support assumptions in the future ratings rationale the negative outlooks are based on moodys expectation that within the next several weeks the canadian authorities will provide more details on the resolution policy for domestic systemically important banks once the details of the bailin regime are announced moodys will evaluate the feasibility of the governments implementing a bailin of senior creditors while maintaining financial stability and limiting any damage to the broader economy the canadian banks are very highly rated and there is little prospect for upward movement in their ratings at this time the following factors would result in downward ratings pressure i a significant deterioration in the operating environment ii a significant increase in consumer loan losses andor iii a significant change in business mix resulting in increased reliance upon capital markets earnings andor earnings from less well positioned international operations for its own business reasons moodys has withdrawn the outlooks for all subordinated instrument ratings of the canadian banks please refer to moodys investors services policy for withdrawal of credit ratings available on its website wwwmoodyscom outlooks which indicate the direction of rating pressures are now only assigned to long term senior debt and deposit ratings moodys also assigned counterparty risk assessments cr assessments to eight canadian banks and deposittaking issuers cr assessments are opinions of how counterparty obligations are likely to be treated if a bank fails and are distinct from debt and deposit ratings in that they  consider only the risk of default rather than the likelihood of default and the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default and  apply to counterparty obligations and contractual commitments rather than debt or deposit instruments the cr assessments are an opinion of the counterparty risk related to a banks covered bonds contractual performance obligations servicing derivatives eg swaps letters of credit guarantees and liquidity facilities in most cases the starting point for the cr assessment  which is an assessment of the ability to avoid defaulting on its operating obligations  is one notch above the banks adjusted bca to which moodys then adds the same notches of support uplift as applied to deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings as a result the cr assessment for most canadian banks is one notch higher than their senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings reflecting moodys view that authorities are likely to honor the operating obligations the cr assessment refers to in order to preserve a banks critical functions and reduce potential for contagion however in the case of the torontodominion bank given its very high senior unsecured debt rating  at aa  moodys has also assigned a cr assessment of aacr the ongoing evolution of banking resolution tools that include debt bailin underscores the need to differentiate counterparty risk from bank debt ratings said david beattie a moodys senior vice president we believe that although debt obligations and other capital instruments may be subject to loss in a resolution counterparty obligations may be shielded in order to preserve the continuity of operations and avoid contagion a list of the affected credit ratings is available at httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf this list is an integral part of this press release and

the regulatory disclosures section was changed to include the correct list of issuers revised release follows toronto may    moodys investors service moodys has today downgraded the baseline credit assessments bcas the longterm ratings and the counterparty risk assessments cras of six canadian banks and their affiliates reflecting moodys expectation of a more challenging operating environment for banks in canada for the remainder of  and beyond that could lead to a deterioration in the banks asset quality and increase their sensitivity to external shocks the banks affected are torontodominion bank bank of montreal bank of nova scotia canadian imperial bank of commerce national bank of canada and royal bank of canada the bcas longterm debt and deposit ratings and cras of the banks and their affiliates were downgraded by  notch excepting only torontodominion banks cra which was affirmed the short term prime ratings of the canadian banks were affirmed all relevant ratings for these banks continue to have negative outlooks reflecting the expected introduction of an operational resolution regime in canada todays downgrade of the canadian banks reflects our ongoing concerns that expanding levels of privatesector debt could weaken asset quality in the future continued growth in canadian consumer debt and elevated housing prices leaves consumers and canadian banks more vulnerable to downside risks facing the canadian economy than in the past said david beattie a moodys senior vice president in the same action moodys affirmed the bcas longterm ratings and cras of cibc mellon trust cibc mellon the fédération des caisses desjardins du québec the fédération and caisse centrale desjardins in view of todays actions moodys does not expect any upward rating pressure on the affected banks in the near term however the canadian banks ratings could be revised upwards if macroeconomic conditions in canada improve and the canadian banks maintain sound financial metrics the affected banks ratings could be downgraded if their fundamentals weaken as evidenced by an even more challenging operating environment andor deterioration in their financial

and identifies each affected issuer httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbc macro profile change under moodys bank rating methodology the first stage of our credit analysis for banks starts with the macro profile our assessment of the macro environment within which a bank operates this reflects our view that bank failures are very often associated with systemic crises driven by macroeconomics rather than idiosyncratic factors our country level analysis focuses on economic strength institutional strength susceptibility to event risk credit conditions funding conditions and industry structure in todays action moodys has changed its assessment of canadas macro profile to strong  from very strong  this change was driven by our view that the credit conditions in canada have deteriorated high levels of debt and rapid credit expansion can signal credit quality problems that emerge later in assessing a given countrys credit conditions we consider the level of privatesector debt to gdp and the growth in private sector debt please refer to our sector indepth canada macro profile strong  httpwwwmoodyscomresearchdocumentcontentpageaspxdocidpbc for further detail please click on this link httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbc for the list of affected credit ratings this list is an integral part of this press release and identifies each affected issuer ratings rationale moodys considers that weakening credit conditions in canada  including an increase in privatesector debt to gdp to  as of the end of  up from  for   present increasing risk to canadian banks asset quality and profitability this increase has been led by household debt which is now at a record high of  of disposable income as at q  and accompanying house price appreciation despite macroprudential measures put into place by canadian policymakers in recent years  which have had some success in moderating the rate of housing price growth  house prices and consumer debt levels remain historically high business credit the other component of privatesector debt has also grown rapidly at a  cagr over the past  years we do note that the canadian banks maintain strong buffers in terms of capital and liquidity however the resilience of household balance sheets and consequently bank portfolios to a serious economic downturn has not been tested at these levels of private sector indebtedness torontodominion bank td aaaa negative a tds strong ratings are attributable to its very strong domestic retail franchise  which generates stable and recurring profitability and its business mix this strength is due to leading market share positions in many personal  commercial financial services products where td typically has market shares in the high teens and holds first or second positions td is the most retail oriented of its canadian peers with approximately  of earnings coming from retail combined canadian personal  commercial wealth management and us personal  commercial excluding corporate while cm income has increased over recent quarters and capital allocated to the wholesale business is rising we expect that reliance on this inherently volatile source of income will remain relatively modest through acquisition and organic growth td has increased its exposure to unsecured canadian consumer credit risk in recent years in our view however the strength and stability of the earnings from tds canadian personal and commercial banking franchise remain the primary credit strength supporting its ratings the ratings of tds us affiliates benefit from support from the parent and as such are also affected by this action bank of montreal bmo aa negative a bmo is one of the six major banks in canada which benefit from the protection of significant barriers to entry and the stability of a prudent regulatory environment although its canadian retail market shares are towards the lower end of the canadian peer group bmo has double digit market shares across all significant retail financial services and products providing scale and recurring earnings power in its home market in our view however the strength and stability of the earnings from bmos canadian personal and commercial pc banking franchise remain the primary credit strength supporting its ratings bmo has a strong and improving us regional banking presence through bmo harris which adds important diversification away from reliance on canadian pc earnings however bmo does not enjoy the same franchise strength and pricing power in the more competitive us market that it does in canada the ratings of bmo harris and affiliates benefit from support from the parent and as such are also affected by this action bank of nova scotia bns aa negative a bns is the most internationally active of the canadian banks with approximately half of its earnings generated outside of canada bns has taken significant measures to increase its profitability that signal a fundamental shift away from the banks traditionally low risk appetite while the banks strategic actions are intended to enhance current profitability  in  bns reported domestic net interest margin lower than the six largest canadian banks average in our view they increase the prospect of future incremental credit losses while bns had strategically grown its credit card and auto finance portfolios  both of which are particularly prone to deterioration during an economic downturn and exhibit higher defaults and loss severities than mortgage portfolios  in recent years growth in  was flat in addition the bank has made a series of acquisitions away from its strong domestic franchise towards highergrowth but less stable international markets bns has aspirations to continue to grow its international earnings which in moodys view adds to bondholder risk canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc aa negative a cibc is the most reliant of the canadian banks on domestic pc earnings which generate approximately  of total earnings excluding corporate in our view however the strength and stability of the earnings from cibcs canadian personal and commercial banking franchise remain the primary credit strength supporting its ratings cibc has the second lowest proportionate exposure to unsecured and nonreal estate secured consumer debt as a percentage of domestic consumer assets roughly  reflective of its very large book of insured mortgages cibc is one of the six major banks in canada that benefit from the protection of significant barriers to entry and the stability of a prudent regulatory environment although its canadian retail market shares are midrange relative to its canadian peers cibc has solid double digit market shares across all significant retail financial services and products providing scale and recurring earnings national bank of canada nbc aa negative baa nbcs dominant position in commercial banking and strong second place share of market in retail banking in québec are the primary credit strengths supporting its high ratings the stability of the recurring earnings power of nbcs regional retail franchise is in moodys view highly unlikely to be challenged that being said nbcs asset base cad billion as of q  and national deposit share roughly  are small relative to the other large canadian banks whose branch systems are more national in scale in our view however the strength and stability of the earnings from nbcs canadian personal and commercial banking franchise remain the primary credit strength supporting its ratings while each of the major canadian banks enjoys the benefits of superior pricing power due to sustainable large market shares in many significant retail and commercial products and services this is true for nbc only in the context of its regional market the province of québec as such the challenges in geographic diversification and earnings stability and the québec credit concentrations offset partially the strength in local market share and sustainability nbc is the canadian bank most reliant upon inherently less stable capital markets earnings which generated  of total earnings excluding corporate for   for  royal bank of canada rbc aa negative a  rbcs ratings reflect its profile as a strong and diversified universal bank with sustainable leading market shares across many retail products and services in its home market the stable earnings from rbcs domestic personal and commercial franchise are a key credit strength rbc has had very low earnings volatility supported by the stabilizing effect of the recurring profitability of rbcs solid domestic retail banking franchise however over the past four years rbc has demonstrated rapid growth in its capital markets business led by growth in its us corporate loan book and the repo and securities finance business we believe that rbcs usfocused capital markets growth strategy increases its exposure to risks that could more rapidly erode its creditworthiness in volatile or adverse market conditions and is therefore negative for the credit to date this risk has been well managed and its performance has been very stable maintaining this performance through more volatile markets will be key to rbcs longer term risk management track record we do not expect that this business will continue on this growth trajectory and in fact that capital committed to the capital markets business will be more constrained management plans to substantially grow the earnings of its recently acquired californiabased private and commercial bank city national bank deposits aa stable a both organically and through targeted acquisitions growth in the city national business presents less credit risk than continued growth in the capital markets area in our view the ratings of two affiliates rbc capital markets llc and rbc barbados trading bank corporation were also affected by this action in each case both long and short term ratings were downgraded fédération des caisses desjardins du québec aaaa negative a  the fédération is a cooperative entity responsible for governance and oversight activities for desjardins group the group it acts as a control and supervisory body over the individual member caisses the fédérations pivotal importance to the groups operations and performance the application of regulatory supervision to the group as a whole as well as the strong strategic and financial cohesion among member caisses with a welldeveloped mutualist support framework lead us to factor the strength of the group into the fédérations bca the group has a secure retail banking franchise in rural québec as well as strong capitalization and limited reliance on wholesale funding its regional banking concentration in québec is offset in part by the groups national insurance and wealth management business the fédérations ratings were affirmed despite the macro profile change because moodys believes its operations to be largely isolated to the province of quebec which has experienced lower house price appreciation than other provinces and because a large proportion of desjardins net income is derived from nonbanking sources such as life and property and casualty insurance cibc mellon trust cibc mellon aa stable a cibc mellon is a major player in the canadian custody market underpinning its franchise value the operations and technology platform provided by bny mellon lends a further competitive advantage bny mellon is the largest custodian globally and its operating platform allows cibc mellon to benefit from economies of scale and service not available to its primary domestic competitor cibc mellons risk management and control environment is strong with an appropriate emphasis on operational risk issues and effective supervision by the joint ventures owners cmt does not make loans other than shortterm overdrafts to custody clients but incurs credit risk through its securities portfolio the investment portfolio is made up largely of shortduration canadian government and provincial bonds as well as corporate debt cibc mellons ratings were affirmed despite the change in the macro profile because moodys believes its custody bank business model is directly unaffected by high consumer debt as it does not lend to consumers please click on this link

downgrades canadian banks rating action moodys downgrades bank of nova scotias ratings outlook negative global credit research   jan  toronto january    today moodys investors service downgraded the long term debt and deposit ratings of bank of nova scotia bns and its subsidiaries to aa from aa its long term counterparty risk assessment to aacr from aacr and its baseline credit assessment to a from a moodys also downgraded bnss senior unsecured shelf and deposit note program ratings to paa from paa and subordinate shelf ratings to pa from pa subordinated debt and noncumulative preferred share obligations are also downgraded according to moodys standard notching convention meanwhile moodys affirmed bnss prime shortterm deposit rating shortterm counterparty risk assessment and other short term ratings the outlook for all bns ratings is negative reflecting moodys view that the balance of risk related to government support has shifted to the downside the affected entities are listed below bank of nova scotia bank of nova scotia houston branch bank of nova scotia new york agency montreal trust company of canada scotiabank capital trust scotiabanc inc scotiabank europe plc scotiabank tier  trust ratings rationale moodys said the ratings change was prompted by bank of nova scotia bns having taken significant measures to increase its profitability that signal a fundamental shift away from the banks traditionally low risk appetite this risk positioning was a key part of the rationale for what had been its superior credit standing while the banks strategic actions are intended to enhance current profitability  bns reports the lowest domestic net interest margin of the six largest canadian banks  in moodys view they increase the prospect of future incremental credit losses over the last two years in accordance with its strategic initiatives bns has accelerated the growth in its credit card and auto finance portfolios  both of which are particularly prone to deterioration during an economic downturn and exhibit higher defaults and loss severities than mortgage portfolios in addition the bank has made a series of acquisitions away from its strong domestic franchise towards highergrowth but less stable international markets bns has aspirations to continue to grow its international earnings which in moodys view adds to bondholder risk moodys believes it is likely that bnss increased risk tolerance and strategic imperative to increase profitability by shifting the asset mix towards higher yielding categories of consumer credit both domestically and in international operations will persist what could change the rating updown given its very high ratings upward rating pressure on bns is unlikely downward pressure will depend upon future trends in business mix and asset quality significantly increased exposure to credit card and auto finance portfolios substantially increased reliance on earnings from international operations andor unexpected profitability erosion or control problems would be credit negative the principal methodology used in these ratings was banks published in january  please see the credit
