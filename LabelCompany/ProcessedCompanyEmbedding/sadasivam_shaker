the call over to shaker shaker sadasivam thanks chris good morning thank you all for joining the conference call today we continue to execute well with our revenue up modestly from the prior quarter and our cash position declined slightly to  million at the end of the first quarter in my prepared remarks last quarter i commented on us building good momentum with leading edge design wins on products for advanced nodes and for new products with our customers as a validation of my comments we received a  million customer deposit this quarter which will be used to invest in related production capabilities this investment will fund new leading edge production capability in our korean facility this customer believes our newest products have the best performance in the process and would like us to ship a higher mix of these wafers for the advanced products this improvement in mix is expected to increase the profitability of our korean operation starting in  for the quarter our factory utilization was about  especially for  millimeter which is higher than that for  millimeter pricing as always remains competitive however given the tightening supply demand picture in  millimeter inventories at seasonal levels and the strengthening yen we hope the competitive landscape becomes more disciplined with respect to our cost improvement plans we continue to be on schedule to close our ipoh malaysia facility end of september and to transfer all this manufacturing capacity to our factory in italy as a result of strong execution from our teams we expect to exceed the ebitda benefits related to the ipoh closure we forecasted earlier we will be in a better position to provide further details later in the year now switching topics we have received many questions regarding the recent chapter  filing of our former parent sunedison inc as you know we separated from them in a public offering nearly two years ago and since then we have been a fully independent company as such we are not a party to the chapter  filing as you also know they were our primary source of polysilicon in the past over the past  to  months we have been making changes to our crystal processes to allow the use of multiple forms of poly including both chunk and granular this enhances our flexibility to use poly from a wider variety of sources we have not been buying polysilicon from sunedison since yearend and we believe we are positioned to procure all the poly we need from other sources at good prices our polysilicon supply chain is as strong as it has ever been in conclusion we continue to execute well and improve our market position our cash position and current coverage are also good the review of strategic options we announced in february continues and there is nothing new to report today at this time we remain committed to meeting our longterm business profitability targets our unique global footprint with facilities located next to our biggest customers our industryleading technologies in epi and soi and our strong focus on operational execution all position us well now i will turn it over to jeff who will go through our q results in more detail jeff hall thank you shaker overall we executed a solid quarter in a market that while strengthening remained tough revenue rose modestly as higher volume more than offset slight price erosion gross margin was basically flat and as shaker said we received a  million customer deposit validating our strength on leadingedge technologies revenue for the quarter was  million up slightly compared to the prior quarter the slight increase was driven by higher unit volumes of  millimeter wafers which were partially offset by lower average pricing mostly in epi the foundrydriven inventory correction appears to be behind us and we are seeing positive signs in this segment again pricing for other product categories was basically flat gross profit was  million approximately flat with the prior quarter as increases in volume lower depreciation and amortization and manufacturing efficiencies offset headwinds from sx and sunedisonrelated charges sga and rd totaled  million for the first quarter this was up  million or  sequentially as spending increased from q levels but still well below prioryear’s  down interest expense was  million for the first quarter down  million compared to the prior quarter which included  million of nonrecurring expenses related to refinancing as i discussed on our last call first quarter  interest expense now reflects the new lower interest rate on the korean wondenominated financing we closed last year ebitda was  million down  million sequentially to a  of sales from  of sales in the prior quarter as a result of higher operating expenses and lower depreciations in may the smp poly facility in korea filed an application for rehabilitation under korean law which is similar to reorganization under us bankruptcy law the uncertainties resulting from this filing and the chapter  filing of sunedison smp’s largest investor and customer – triggered an interim impairment analysis resulting in the recording of an  million other than temporary impairment charge in the quarter this impairment charge is recorded in equity and loss of equity mechanism investments in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of this impairment our equity investment in sp is now recorded on our balance sheet at zero value cash flow from operations for the quarter was  million down from  million in the prior quarter primarily as a result of changing and working capital in the prior quarter capex for the first quarter was  million as shaker described in his comments we received a  million deposit from a customer to fund increased capability that will allow us to ship a higher mix of leadingedge wafers to this customer which we expect to increase profitability starting in  about  million of this deposit was used in the first quarter offsetting a large portion of our first quarter capex spend the remainder of the deposit is reflected on our balance sheet in other longterm assets and we plan to spend it over the course of this year the deposit will be credited against the wafer shipments over three years beginning in q of  and is specifically excluded from all debt covenant calculations despite the sequentially higher first quarter capex our cash balance decreased only  million to  million from  million in the prior quarter as we continue to manage our cash taking advantage of our strong market position and product portfolio when opportunities arise earlier this year we announced our board of directors has authorized a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives following the receipt of unsolicited preliminary indications of interest in the company we do not have an update or timeline at this point but we’ll issue updates as appropriate and as you might expect we are unable to provide additional comments on this topic today as i have mentioned before our top priorities in operating the business are to continue growing ebitda by executing on margin improvement initiatives including factory consolidation improving mix trying to drive price increases and balancing our capex spend with our sources of cash thank you for joining us today and we’ll now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question today will come from toshiya hari with goldman sachs please go ahead toshiya hari hi good morning and thanks for taking my question the first one is on pricing you guys talked about inventory being seasonal and how the appreciation of the japanese yen could potentially lead to more discipline at your competitors based on that what’s kind of your outlook in terms of pricing for both  millimeter and  millimeter going into q and perhaps going into the backhalf as well shaker sadasivam hey toshiya this is shaker toshiya hari hi shaker sadasivam sorry did you want to say something toshiya hari no no please shaker sadasivam okay so in my prepared remarks we talk about  millimeter supply demand getting tight again and we are in a similar situation in the first half of  and it weakened some in the second half but our customers continue to add capacity whereas i don’t really see suppliers adding any meaningful capacity so it is going to tighten as you look forward but unfortunately what we see is that the competitors seem to have lost the pricing muscle memory the industry used to – as supply tightened the typical cycle we’ve followed was increased pricing and as demand decreased and supply exceeded demand the pricing would go down but that that behavior has completely been forgotten and it’s important that the industry regains the pricing muscle memory and we expect the demand to continue to stay tight if the market demand does stay strong and there’s a good opportunity if the competitive landscape stays disciplined while price increases in the second half toshiya hari okay so is it fair to say that base case pricing is flattish in q and into the back half or could there be a scenario where you could actually see a pricing increase in the back half or too early is that… shaker sadasivam we don’t specifically give forecast but what i will say is we are not as bearish as what maybe some of the other comments have been out there in terms of pricing expectations toshiya hari okay thank you and quickly as my followup i had a question on capex as well so you spent about  million in q and i appreciate that you had received a deposit from your customer to partially pay for that  million but i was wondering what the new steadystate is for you guys in terms of capex going forward i think you had spent somewhere between  million and  million per quarter over the past couple of years is the  million a oneoff number or are we kind of in a new steadystate thank you jeff hall yes well we certainly don’t think  million is steadystate just to make that clear the way i look at q is you’ve got to subtract from the  million the approximately  million that we spent on – related to the specific customer deposit which we look at as a great investment for us we’ve got a customer that loves how our product is yielding they think it’s the best they’ve seen as a result they want us to increase the mix for them and drive a higher mix of that leadingedge product and they are willing to put their money where their mouth is by basically giving us the capital essentially five years for use of money to drive a profitability improvement product – project for us that also is going to increase theirs so it’s a great case of winwin in that case so i subtract that from the  million – that gets me to about  million of capex we said that in a normal environment we think  million to  million is what we’ve been running and that we manage that kind of up or down depending on balancing it with our uses of – sources of cash and with the ability to invest in high roi projects we’ve said it was a little higher than that over  as a result of spending on soi which is certainly coming to an end and i think in general you see that capex tends to be a little bit more frontendloaded so we continue to as we look forward trying to balance our sources and uses of cash with capex but certainly would not think that  million is the new run rate you’d have to subtract the prepayment capex from that toshiya hari very helpful thank you so much shaker sadasivam thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of david wong with wells fargo david wong thank you much so on the question of cash your cash and equivalents balance – i think it was  million – nearly  million – do you have any plans to boost that balance above anything that might come in from operation and cash flows are there any other sources of cash that you are looking into jeff hall we have no plans today david to do anything to raise cash other than through operations as we’ve said many times our goal is to drive ebitda growth we think we have a lot of good opportunities to do that we’re happy with how we’re executing on those priorities and as ebitda grows the cash is going to go along with it right now no other plans david wong right and jeff do you have a minimum number for cash and equivalents that you are comfortable with what can that drop to and still be okay and when would you actually take some action to boost the balance jeff hall it’s always hard to be specific on a question like that i think on one hand you can never have enough cash but on the other hand you’ve got to balance how you invest that and what kind of returns you make we feel good with the levels we have today and as i said we don’t have any plans to go out and raise capital at this point david wong okay and one final clarification so the customer deposit you mentioned you put the balance of that in longterm assets and that can be used for some form of capex are there any other parts of your other assets balance on your balance sheet that are essentially cash which you can use for capex or any other types of cash expenses jeff hall no is the simple answer to that david wong great thanks very much operator thank you next we will go to the line of sidney ho with deutsche bank sidney ho good morning thanks for taking my questions so let me start out with a clarification given the impairment charges that you have to record for sp do you still plan to procure a majority of polysilicon from sunedison at the contracted price when the facility is up and running or is that plan completely suspended and if you do decide to procure from other sources do you still expect the price to be competitive compared to if you were to buy from smp down the road shaker sadasivam so in terms of what we have done pretty since the ipo in the last  to  months has significantly improved our flexibility to use alternative sources of polysilicon and where we are today is we have the capability to use any one of the industry standard electronic grade polysilicon suppliers and the way we are managing our own polysilicon supply situation is we’ve built sufficient inventory of granular polysilicon to last us well through  and some into  and we have also secured supply agreements with key electronic grade polysilicon suppliers to take care of our supply and from a pricing perspective there is some headwind but we hope to mitigate a lot of it through cost reduction actions and the factory consolidation actions we are taking but generally the team has done a good job of negotiating good prices for us on the polysilicon contracts that they have gone to from upsell and smp today is no more a viable alternative sidney ho okay that’s clear maybe a longerterm question you have a semiconductor market growth seems to have kind of stalled with smartphones growing slower and pcs actually declining for a few years now and those two markets account for roughly  of wafer demand understanding no one is building new wafer capacity but does that actually make sense to start cutting unproductive assets and kind of related to that is there any other facilities other than at ipoh that you currently operate has suboptimal cost structure and is it a possibility to convert some of them to soi facility where the pricing and profitability probably is better shaker sadasivam i think if you could clarify your comments about cutting productive are you talking about us cutting product capacity or… sidney ho yes you but also the industry as a whole but more focused mainly on you shaker sadasivam yes you know if you look at the industry in terms of supply demand and utilization perspective where there is really weakness is in  millimeter but  millimeter and  millimeter continue to be strong and our customers are adding incremental capacity definitely more capacity than what’s being added by the silicon wafer supplier so i don’t really see a real opportunity for taking away productive capacity either for us or from a competitive perspective as long as they feel like they have the right profitability and for us the ipoh consolidation like we have talked about before is really taking two subscale factories and creating one scale factory to achieve the profitability that we want to achieve on our longterm profitability and we continue to do the same with that other factory – there is really no further consolidation plan we’re just improving the profitability of existing facilities to get to the  to  longterm goal that we’ve talked about in terms of ebitda sidney ho great and if i could squeak in one more question with the yen and the won both strengthening lately how should we think about the impact on you is there like a rule of thumb to help us think about – for example a  move equates to roughly a certain impact in gross margin operating margin jeff hall it’s hard to be that precise because really i would say the impact is twofold obviously we have operations in japan and korea so as kind of a first order there is some headwind from those currencies strengthening as a result of conversion of those costs but that’s a smaller impact quite frankly we saw the same thing in reverse last year right where we have a tailwind from those currencies devaluing but in our view that was more than offset by the price reductions it allowed our competitors in japan to take so we look at it what shaker said earlier is yes we’ve got a little bit of a headwind we’re working hard to mitigate that but what we’re – if we wanted to be optimistic about it we would say that the strengthening of those currencies is going to help us significantly in a pricing standpoint sidney ho okay perfect thanks so much shaker sadasivam thank you operator operator instructions we will go now to jagadish iyer with redstone jagadish iyer yes thanks for taking my question i have one clarification and two questions so first on the smp joint venture i just wanted to clarify should we anticipate no more polysilicon from that in the event that this asset is being taken over by somebody do you think that you guys can get your percentage of stake in terms of cash from that venture and then i have two questions please jeff hall yes so as we said at this point we do not expect to source any poly – we’re not counting on any sourcing any polysilicon from smp we’re comfortable with both the inventory we have and the changes we’ve made to our process to allow different forms that we’re comfortable we can get the poly we need from other sources the fact that we wrote it down to zero – i would look at that as – that’s purely an accountingbased decision there’s a bunch of uncertainty related to the sunedison bankruptcy there’s also uncertainty – they are the biggest shareholder the biggest customer there is not an lot of uncertainty of the rehabilitation filing of smp so as we looked at those two uncertainties and the fact that we are not expecting to source polysilicon from it we felt like the best answer from an accounting standpoint was to write the asset down to zero whether we’ll be able to realize some value from that in the future or whether they will be able to get it up in production remains uncertain quite frankly certainly if they’re able to produce poly and it meets our spec and it’s a good price we would be happy to use it jagadish iyer that’s helpful so shaker you talked about the pricing situation for  how should we think about volumes as we progress through the year shaker sadasivam you know… jagadish iyer for both  millimeter and  millimeter shaker sadasivam i don’t want to give any forecast but if look at just the silicon wafer volumes yearonyear typically the growth has been more robust than the revenue for example  to  the unit growth was closer to about  to   to  it was in the other  to  so typically unit growth is a lot less cyclical and a lot more robust than revenue growth so i would say from a units perspective relative to what the revenue forecasts are – because a lot of it is covered by what’s happening with pricing and memory et cetera unit growth should be much better than what industry revenue forecasts are jagadish iyer fair enough and also can you just guys let us know what the soi sales were in the first quarter and how should we think about soi sales for  versus  thank you shaker sadasivam so jagadish for soi definitely had a strong year last year with significant doubledigit growth yearonyear and we expect a similar growth in  we are not breaking it out in  for competitive reasons but the market continues to be strong and even though smartphone sales have slowed down the amount of content tied to soi is still strong and so we expect it to continue to be a good growth opportunity for our business jagadish iyer would it be fair to say that they could be  of your sales this year shaker sadasivam yes about jagadish iyer okay fair enough thank you shaker sadasivam thank you operator thank you speakers at this time there are no further questions in queue shaker sadasivam okay thank you thank you all for joining the call so to summarize the quarter i’d like to say we have continued to execute well and improve our market position we’re also making good progress with our factory consolidation plans that will add incremental  million to our ebitda starting in  with  million of that coming in  and with that i turn it

statementswith that i’d like to now turn the call over to shakershaker sadasivamthanks chris good morning everyone and thank you all for joining our conference call our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations while revenue for the fourth quarter was down following a stronger second and third quarter demand held up better than last year and we continue to make good progress on our key goal of improving profitabilityunit volumes were essentially flat for the quarter but average pricing was lower compared to last quarter due to customer and product mix despite lower revenue we grew our ebitda sequentially we reduced operating expenses continue to drive operational improvements in our factories and generated positive operating cash flowour  millimeter factories continue to operate close to full capacity and  millimeter utilization increased in the quarter our view remains that the continued tightness in the  millimeter market and some segments of the  millimeter market will lead to price increases in  and we are continuing our efforts to raise priceswhile we see signs of improved pricing we do not see meaningful increases at this point and expect lower pricing to continue in the first half of  despite our efforts to raise prices improved pricing is an important step to meet our goals and to allow us to continue investing in rd and the capacity needs of our customers we made rapid progress in soi during the fourth quarter our volumes grew  sequentially and our capacitys fully booked for the remainder of the year we continue to see high interest in our soi capabilities and expect to complete a significant capacity expansion in the first half of this year to serve demandearlier this year we received the best partner award from samsung one of our largest customers this award is presented to the supplier that provides the most outstanding products and service  was the second time in the last three years that we have received this award also in october we were awarded the preferred supplier award from infineon in recognition of outstanding supplier performance in the frontend material wafer category id like to take a moment to thank our customers for this recognition and our employees whose dedication and hard work enabled these achievements  was a transition year for our business we went public in may concluded a three year longterm agreement with samsung to grow our business secured new business opportunities and soi in other product segments and improved our ebitda margins by  we remain focused on improving the profitability of

to get us these flash numbers at year end in only seven days thank yourevenue for the quarter was  million down  compared to the prior quarter this decline was primarily the result of lower pricing as demand remained strong but our mix was skewed towards lower end products rapidly growing and higher asp products such as epi and soi are expected to improve our sales mix later this yearread the rest

forwardlooking statements with that ill now turn the call over to shaker shaker sadasivam thanks chris and thank you all for joining the call this morning i would like to begin by highlighting some of the key areas where we made good progress in  first we successfully completed a partial refinancing of our debt lowering future interest payments enhancing our capital structure flexibility and improving covenant coverage we also maintain closed to a flat position on cash throughout the year while making significant investments in soi and enhancing factory capability to make advanced products and finally we improved our gross margin and ebitda margins year on year despite tough market conditions into second half of  turning now to the fourth quarter our revenues were down sequentially driven by market weakness impacting volumes of smaller diameter wafers and pricing in general although our total volume were sequentially lower our overall utilization is high and our  millimeter utilization continues to be over  our fourth quarter ebitda margins grew with to  from  in the prior quarter due to good controls of our marketing and administration and rd expense we are continuing to make good progress with our previously announced closure of our ipoh malaysia facility and they transfer of this manufacturing capacity to our factory in italy we expect to see meaningful benefit to our ebitda following the closure we have a high degree of confidence in our estimates of a  million benefit in  and an incremental benefit of another  million into  that is an annual ebitda benefit of  million per year starting in  i would also like to highlight the work we have done since our ipo in may  to secure our polysilicon supply chain we have improved our manufacturing flexibility to use various types of electronic grade polysilicon while also diversifying a supply base also this year we will begin to qualify polysilicon from smp our joint venture in korea with all these actions we believe that the recent announcement from sunedison on closing the polysilicon plant in texas will have little to no impact for our poly supply actually our poly contingency plan is a best it has ever been and as i highlighted in my opening comments weve finished the quarter pretty close to flat on cash and completed refinancing a portion of our debt i strongly feel that we are much better positioned today across the entire business financial operations customer positioning and research and development compared to where we were at the same time last year we continue to build good momentum with design wins on products for advanced nodes and for new product with our customers a few weeks ago we announced that we were beginning the process of evaluating a range of strategic alternatives which include among other things a merger or sale of the company or continuing to pursue our existing operating and growth plan we have talked consistently about a need for industry consolidation we continue to believe this makes sense with the right partner while we evaluate these options we remain committed to executing to our current business plan and making good progress in  towards our longterm ebitda margin goals of  to  we believe our unique global footprint with facility located next to our biggest customers our industry leading technologies at fe and soi and our strong focus on operational execution and cost all position us well now i will turn it over to jeff who will go through our q and yearend results in more detail jeffrey l hall thank you shaker overall a better sales mix and tough expense management helped us to execute a good quarter despite the difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter we were able to mostly offset a  decline in revenue with better product mix and tough decisions on sga and rd expenses as a result our ebitda declined only  and our ebitda margin grew from  from  in the prior quarter in addition we were able to refinance a portion of our debt lowering our interest expense while significantly improving our flexibility and covenant coverage revenue for the fourth quarter was  million down  compared to the prior quarter this decrease was primarily the result of lower volumes of smaller diameter wafers combined with slightly weaker pricing gross profit in the fourth quarter was  million or  of revenue down sequentially primarily due to lower pricing volume fullyear gross margin grew to  in  compared to  in  despite a  decline in revenue as we were able to offset price erosion with manufacturing cost reductions sga and rd total  million for the fourth quarter down about  million after excluding the  million pension charge in the third quarter this is an addition to the  million reductions in operating expenses we achieved in q for the fullyear we reduced sga and rd cost by about  compared to  ebitda for the quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to  million and  in the prior quarter for the fullyear ebitda was  million up  despite to  decline in revenue cash flow from operations for the quarter was  million up from  million in the prior quarter as a result of improvements in working capital capex for the fourth quarter was  million down from the  in the third quarter for the fullyear our capex totaled  million and we made significant investments in leading edge products as i mentioned earlier we successfully refinanced a portion of our debt through a prepayment of our us denominated term loan using fund from a new loan facility in korea the nominated in korean won the new debt carries a lower interest which will save us about  million annually in interest expense in addition the new debt allows for better currency matching enhances our capital structure flexibility and improves our covenant coverage as part of the refinancing process we also improved the definition of indebtedness and now exclude unfunded letters of credit debt to ebitda under the new calculation was well below our covenant of  times in q interest expense was  million for the fourth quarter include two nonrecurring expenses related to the refinancing  million prepayment premium and  million from the writeoff of unamortized deferred loan cost and discounts our cash balance decreased  million in the quarter to  million from  million in the prior quarter for the fullyear cash declined  million despite spending  million on capex as shaker said earlier on february  we announced our board of directors has authorized the process to explore a range of strategic alternatives following the recite unsolicited preliminary indications of interest in the company we do not have an update or timeline at this point but we will issue update as appropriate and as you might expect we are unable to entertain questions or provide additional comments on this topic today as i have mentioned before our top priorities are to continue to grow ebitda by executing on the margin improvement initiatives we have including factory consolidation improving mix and trying to drive pipe increases driving industry consolidation and balancing our capex spend with our sources of cash thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instruction our first question today comes from a line of sidney ho with deutsche bank please go ahead sidney ho thanks for taking my questions i understand there is a little bit of amount you can talk about the strategic alternatives but the idea of consolidation has been out there for while just curious why you choose now to disclose the discussion and related to that do you think there is anything you can do internally from a manufacturing or op expense point that can help improve your position in these negotiations jeffrey l hall sure i said a few minutes ago the reason we disclosed discussion now is because we received two indication of interest on solicited are there things we can do of course there are things we can do we are aggressively managing our costs we are driving towards ebitda targets we got an aggressive factory consolidation initiatives underway that shaker said is going to save us  million in  and  million a year starting in  we are driving our business to grow an fe and soi we are working on price increases we continually focus on taking cost out of opex so we are working very hard to improve our business overall sidney ho okay great my followup question is that there are some constrains that your former parent company may have some liquidity issues can you walk us through your thoughts if that does happen what it means to your equity stake in smp and what is the impact on your longterm poly agreement with smp is there any clause in the supply agreement that protects you guys and lastly is there like a change of control provision in supply agreement jeffrey l hall overall as we talked about related to smp in poly since our ipo weve been working very hard to improve our contingency plans in the rate of poly and as shaker said we feel our contingency plans are better today than they have the ever been in the past so we feel pretty good about that in the supply agreement if we end up using supply other than sunedison or smp we are confident that we will be able to negotiate prices that approximate the pricing to get there so we feel good about our contingency plan and feel good about the ongoing ability to operate in our business sidney ho thanks so much operator and we do have a question from the line of david wong with wells fargo please go ahead david wong thanks very much in the quarters what will your capex run rate be jeffrey l hall we have sense specific about forward guidance on capex as we continue to say we are focused on balancing our sources and uses of cash we achieved this balance pretty well in  as we are only used  of cash while investing about  historically run rates about  million spent higher recently due to the spending on soi if we felt like we need to take capex down to keep the balance of cash we could come well below the  million number the other side of that is if we got more prepayments or cash in from customers to fund specific capability initiatives then capex could go up so we are trying to keep our flexibility open weve got a pretty wide range of possibilities but really the top goal for us is to balance sources of cash with uses of cash while continuing to grow the profitability of our business david wong great and do you expect to reduce operating expenses rather other from the december quarter levels or what we see in december reflects your cost cutting efforts jeffrey l hall yes i dont see a lot more downward possibility i actually said the same thing back in q and we managed to squeeze a little more out in q so i dont think there is a lot more downward possibility we feel reasonable at these levels every year as you crossover yearend there is always upward pressure on opex that as a management team you got to go in and try to overcome the effect of inflation and et cetera so were working hard on that right now trying to see if we can hold at these levels we think we can at this level if we saw pricing increase or revenue increase there might be a little bit of upward pressure but i dont think there is lot of downward possible at this point david wong great thanks my final question i mean putting all of that together from what you see a current business and expense trends do you expect net debt will grow over the next few quarters or will you be able to hold it at the current levels jeffrey l hall its hard to comment specifically on that without having forward guidance out there right i mean the headwinds and tailwinds of the business as we go through that we will continue to manage our business and really as i said our focus is balanced david wong great thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of jagadish iyer with redstone please go ahead jagadish iyer shaker what is your best estimate for msi growth this year for the industry and how should we think specifically for sunedison semi in terms of msi growth for this year given what all has happened last year so i just wanted to get your thoughts on that shaker sadashivam okay we dont do our own internal forecasting for the markets so we pretty much rely on forecasts that you look at and you definitely have a better angle on those but just in terms of how we are looking at the market for  look at to a primary thing one is our general view of the market and two is our positioning in the market that is with respect to customers and as we look into  we feel comfortable about both both our positioning of customers and we feel comfortable with how the market is shaping up so far so i would leave it at that jagadish iyer okay so just generally and this is might be even relevant for jeff as well so i just wanted to understand how do you manage in terms of the pricing situation here because three of your competitors have a favorable currency on their back so how should we think about the fx impact on pricing as we look at the next couple of quarters and also some thoughts on general i know you laid out something but i wanted to get your thoughts on how the volume pricing dynamics is going to play out particularly if there is going to be still the us dollar is going to be stronger shaker sadashivam i think so far what weve seen is that the pricing is  i mean the foreign exchange advantage for our key competitive has definitely been a headwind for the pricing in general for the industry because from a supply demand perspective  millimeter has really been at capacity and in some cases at quarters where demand has exceeded capacity so we were actually expecting price increases in  didnt play out if the market and like i said before stay strong in the first half of  and when we go into negotiation with second half it definitely puts us in a better position and i think there has been some weakening or strengthening in the yen recently which should help and i think everybody uniformly has been talking about wanting to increase pricing in order to be able to justify investment currently with the current pricing it doesnt make sense for any of us any of the competitors even with the weakening currency to make investments in capacity and our customers are continuing to add capacity so the situation from a supply and demand perspective should only get worse and i think first step there would be all of us has discipline prices go up and go up sufficiently for us to be able to just by adding capacity but we will be careful about from our perspective very careful in how we add capacity and our indiscernible jagadish iyer okay finally just wanted to understand this better why can’t you completely liquidate your position in smp and get the cash if the polysilicon market seems to be reasonably stable in your opinion in terms of pricing so why can’t you just get out of there completely of the smp and get the cash from that so that you can make that strategic investments that you need going forward thank you jeffrey l hall we did as we said we sold a portion of our investment we did comment in the k which im sure most of you didn’t had a chance to read yet but that transaction has now closed we did received a thirdparty approval so weve closed on that sale we would certainly be willing to consider additional sales of smp but obviously any sell takes a buyer on the opposite side so we haven’t announced anything at this point and its hard to really comment on any more detail than that jagadish iyer thank you shaker sadashivam thank you operator and we do have a question from the line of toshiya hari with goldman sachs please go ahead toshiya hari hi good morning my first question is regarding volume trends and pricing trends could you maybe give us some idea as to have both volumes and pricing trended by different diameters in q and what your outlook is for q and perhaps q and beyond jeffrey l hall yes so we don’t breakout volume changes by diameter we think that’s getting too close to competitive information and we don’t really want to provide that level of detail to all of our competitors and customers as shaker said volume remains tight we saw some inventory correction in the back half of  it now appears to us that inventory corrections over we are seeing demands strengthen overall a little bit and it looks pretty tight across certainly  and into  but other than that we don’t really comment specifically on that diameters toshiya hari okay thank you my second question is regarding your strategy going forward you mentioned in your prepaid remarks that industry consolidation would make sense with the right partner could maybe point to specific characteristics you would look for in a potential partner jeffrey l hall well i mean if you think about industry consolidation i mean you look at just the overlap of what we do right we all sell to the same customers we all make the same product we do a lot of the same research and development and we do a lot of the same marketing so just by consolidating that we would see potential large synergy in opex in addition there is the potential to further optimize scale right we look at the two bigger guys in our industry and they defiantly have scale benefits from being much larger that go beyond just opex buying more of the key supplies that we buy gives us more purchasing power so we think there is lots of synergy just from putting company together and getting to a bigger scale and it also gives us the bigger percentage of share with our customers to allow us to have better standing in those negotiations as well so that’s the simple reason why we think it makes sense toshiya hari okay helpful and finally is there is strict deadline at which you would inform us your customer and your employees of your future plans i ask because i’m sure the current situation adds a bit of uncertainty to i guess everyone jeffrey l hall no there is no deadline we going to work through it carefully and thoughtfully and make the right decision and when we are at a point to tell you more we will tell you more we may end up doing nothing we may end up with other alternatives so its hard to say at this time toshiya hari very clear thank you very much shaker sadashivam thank you operator and we do have a question from the line of amanda scarnati with citi please go ahead amanda scarnati hi thanks for taking the questions just on order linearity throughout the quarter we saw cuts indiscernible late in the quarter which impacted the suppliers and indiscernible supply chain did you see any sort of order followup towards the end of the quarter or your lead time a little bit different where you would see more of a fall of this quarter instead of your fourth quarter thank you shaker sadashivam we don’t get into detail on a monthly basis but in general majority of our volume and revenue for the quarter we have a pretty good feel going in to the quarter and there is not big changes once we know what the numbers are at the start of the quarter but its not a case where  there can be some minor changes in terms of ups and downs but not significantly amanda scarnati and then what are your typical lead times in terms of order to shipment shaker sadashivam order to shipment we typically have a backlog and a forecast at the start of the quarter and if demands come in beyond that to the quarter depending on how much open capacity we have we can accommodate those with shorter lead times but where we have to go do some adjustments to the mix that will take a longer lead time so there is no  people where we have the backlog clearly book its done and depending on capacity utilization it can affect the lead times for the rest of the demand that comers in amanda scarnati and then you mentioned that mix was better this quarter assuming then it would be indiscernible mix that was a little bit stronger what has helped to kind of offset the weakness in  millimeter is that the correct way of thinking that shaker sadashivam yes so essentially the product mix you talk about is primarily fe and soi and we have talked about those two being key advantages for us and we continue to use that to leverage our mix and our pricing in the margins amanda scarnati great thank you shaker sadashivam thank you operator and we have a question from the line of yoshi azuma with jefferies please go ahead yoshi azuma hi shaker the first question regarding the china do you have any plan to supply ingot or bare wafer to chinese wafer manufacturer or like provide some technologies shaker sadasivam today we supply all the key customers and china yoshi azuma no no i’m talking about the supply ingot or bare wafer to chinese wafer manufacturer not chinese chip makers shaker sadasivam yes i think its pretty unlikely that we would supply work in process kind of material to chinese wafering houses and it’s probably even more unlikely that we would supply intellectual property to chinese wafering guys yoshi azuma okay got it the second question is regarded polysilicon you mentioned that smp going to produce polysilicon a semiconductor grade polysilicon but as far as i know that smp cannot produce semiconductor grade polysilicon so now you are procuring polysilicon from indiscernible at a much cheaper cost than your competitors from now on you cannot take advantage of a cheap polysilicon anymore in the future is that correct shaker sadasivam no i would like to correct at misconception smp has actually got a better technology across the whole factory both the front end for making silane and also the back end with a crude bed reactors and the factory is designed to also make semiconductor grade polysilicon the silane actually will have purity equivalent if not better than what we get at pasadena and the reactors have higher productivity but in terms of quality they have the same capability as pasadena so we already do have initial samples of semiconductor grade polysilicon from smp and we have so design wise its designed for making some of the grades we also have samples and technically its a design for a much better technology than what we had pasadena jeffrey l hall and i would say and as for a longterm supply we have a year contract for polysilicon supply which has pricing lower than we had in  and continuing lower over the course of that year contract so we feel pretty good about that as well yoshi azuma let me go on with that year contract with smp jeffrey l hall a year contract with sunedison yoshi azuma okay but the sunedison is going to close all the polysilicon facilities right or how can they procure or how can they provide you jeffrey l hall through smp yoshi azuma okay got it indiscernible so how can you make free cash flow into positive your free cash flow has been negative for four years and this year is likely to be rough than last year given that the price already indiscernible and the volume probably roughly the same i dont think to  millimeter  millimeter soi alone can increase cash flow by indiscernible so what is your game plan jeffrey l hall so its the things you have been talking about right as weve got a factory consolidation and optimization project underway thats going to when complete have  million a year of free cash flow or sorry of ebitda we have the poly supply contract i just talked about we continue to drive manufacturing and opex efficiencies volume actually looks tighter now than it has been going forward so well look at that i think those are pretty good set of tailwinds shaker sadasivam yes and since you have gone through our ipo even in tough market conditions weve shown our ability to improve profitability and manage our cash so i dont see any reason why we cannot execute to the same level going forward and thats how we will execute yoshi azuma but if you so confident that you can improve your free cash flow why you are thinking about strategic alternatives jeffrey l hall yes its what i have said i think twice now on the call so far which is the reason were considering strategic alternatives because we received unsolicited preliminary indications of interest from outside parties yoshi azuma okay so it means that it is not your intention jeffrey l hall no it means unsolicited yoshi azuma okay jeffrey l hall we have said what our intention is at the end of the day weve been talking about industry consolidations since our ipo that we think industry consolidation makes a lot of sense and can create a lot of value for the industry the reason we are now talking about strategic alternatives publically is because we received indications of interest unsolicited and that made us feel like we needed to disclose that yoshi azuma okay got it understood thank you shaker sadasivam thank you operator and we do have a followup question from jagdish iyer with redstone please go ahead jagdish iyer thanks for taking the followup a quick question jeff or shaker how should we think about gross margins going into  do you think that essentially your gross margins has troughed at q and you should start to see some uptick graduals going through the rest of the year thank you jeffrey l hall well i mean unfortunately there is lot of moving parts we can talk about headwinds and tailwinds i just talked about a lot of the tailwinds we see its hard to anticipate is where pricing us going to go we did a nice job we think over the course of  offsetting the negative price impact through manufacturing efficiencies certainly thats our goal for next year and certainly we see a lot of tailwinds and were working on a lot of initiatives but its impossible to predict where pricing would go although as we said earlier we feel like the industry is very tight jagdish iyer thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions in queue please continue shaker sadasivam well thank you everyone for taking the time to listen to our call today we look forward to talking to you again next quarter thank you

  by the boeing center in order to reduce operational costs and maximize beer freshness anheuserbusch inbev is constantly identifying new tracking technologies to help them stay on top of their shipments many carriers have their own digital portals showing the location and route of their trucks but since abi contracts with hundreds of different carriers the time and complexity needed to manage shipment logistics requires a different solution as a result they’ve developed an application that allows logistics managers to log into a single portal and see realtime tracking on all trucks  unlike other existing portals abi’s aggregates many different carriers’ data feeds in a single user interface in addition to seeing where the trucks are they can also see what routes they’ve taken to get there the contents of each truck and the estimated time of delivery the application is available to wholesalers as well allowing them to plan ahead for the unloading process navigation in phone isolated d image the technology also allows abi to utilize a tracking technology called “geofencing” as soon as a truck crosses these virtual fences a sensor pings their distribution centers and lets them know its exact location and the time it arrived at that location it also gives them insight into their operational efficiency ie how quickly the trucks are being unloaded and turned around by using these technologies abi is able to have greater visibility of its supply chain on a granular level they can then take this information to identify the most efficient carriers and negotiate rates in the video above dan hazlett and matt gordon of abi describe some of the innovative technologies they are employing to improve the visibility of their payloads this is a highlight of their

flavor and texture to your mixed drinks if you want to step beyond the traditional olive garnish for your regular martini opt for a cocktail pick stacked with pickled peppers instead or if you prefer

transform the space from bland to beautiful protect wooden table surfaces from hot serving dishes drips and spills williamssonoma features a great selection of designs and colors from neutrals to vibrant prints our collections also include other linen essentials to mix and match with your tableclothmixing and matching tablecloths with your other dining room decor can be fun and easy to start take stock of the other colors in the space if your walls furniture and curtains are neutral you can choose nearly any color or print if your walls or drapes feature a bold hue you can opt for a print that picks up on one of the colors in the room or features a contrasting shade white and neutral tablecloths work in virtually any space so these are a safe option whites and neutrals work well in small kitchens and dining nooks as they do not overwhelm smaller spacesthe occasion can also play a role in your color and print choice white and neutral tablecloths are great choices for formal events as they let the food and centerpieces play a central role in your tabletop decor prints and bright colors are appropriate for casual dining and everyday dinners and they show off your personality when guests come over florals and countryinspired patterns work well with traditional decor schemes whereas bohemian and geometric prints look great with contemporary room decor styles you can also get festive with a holidayinspired linen design when halloween thanksgiving or winter rolls aroundif you want to protect the surface of a wood table consider adding a table pad underneath your linens pads are usually made from waterresistant materials which help keep liquids away from your wood a thick fabric coasters and a few trivets can provide some additional protectiontablecloths come in several different sizes so measure your table before choosing new linens pair square cloths with round and square tables if your table is rectangular measure both the length and the width the amount of drop over the edge depends on both your personal tastes and the occasion longer tablecloths lend a formal aesthetic to your dining area so these work well for fancy dinner parties and special occasions shorter drops have a casual and easygoing look and they tend to be more practical for everyday dining if your table features unusual measurements play around with different linens to decorate your table layer a square tablecloth diagonally over a rectangular one or get creative with table runnersto complete your tabletop design add other linens to your decor if you opt for a printed tablecloth add solid napkins pick up on the colors in the cloth to create a cohesive design small prints can sometimes have the same effect as solid shades so these can also work with printed tablecloths if you choose a solid or neutral piece add a table runner to bring some color to the table runners are narrow strips of fabric that run along the center of your table so these work well for adding some personality without overwhelming your dining space printed place mats are also great for adding some accents to a neutral tableclothwe offer plenty of tabletop accessories to complete your dining area although tablecloths offer some protection from spills and drips they do not protect wood surfaces from heat if you want to serve hot platters serving dishes or saucepans on your table add a few trivets for protection lazy susans are useful accessories for family dinners and dinner parties simply add small platters or appetizers to the sides and spin it around to serve your delicious dishes to your guests choose serving bowls and platters in colors that pick up on the shades in your printed tablecloth if your linens are neutral choose dramatic hues to make your tabletop
