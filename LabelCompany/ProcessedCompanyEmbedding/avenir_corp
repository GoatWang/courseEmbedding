avenir corporation welcome  about aveniravenir is a value oriented investment management firm located in washington dcthe firm was founded in  and functioned primarily as a family office until the late ’s at which point we began accepting new accounts today avenir manages over  billion in separate accounts for individuals families and institutions including limited partnerships foundations pensions and endowments avenir is owned by its principal managers who combined have over five decades of investment management experience through numerous market cyclesour missionavenir’s mission is to preserve and enhance the purchasing power of the capital entrusted to our careour philosophyavenir’s investment philosophy is best characterized as “discounttointrinsic value” investing and centers on an ability to determine a company’s true net worth which we establish by evaluating the longterm free cash flows generated by the business we then assess a management team’s ability to compound intrinsic value on a per share basis over timeour philosophy is derived from the work of benjamin graham as further refined by warren buffett and charlie munger among others and is based upon the premise that no one can consistently predict the direction of the stock market or interest rates which leads us to focus solely on a “bottomup” analysis of an investment opportunitywe are patient longterm investors and seek to earn an attractive return with a margin of safety further we go wherever we see value and are not limited by market capitalization or country of domicile avenir portfolios are generally concentrated and are managed for total return over a long period of time  disclaimer — avenir corporation avenir corporation is registered as an investment advisor with the

corporation applying our philosophy  applying our philosophywe seek out companies that possess three characteristicsa lasting franchise honest shareholderoriented management with excellent capital allocation skills and a bargain valuationcompanies fitting this description are typically fairly valued in the marketplace  while financial markets are usually efficient they will from time to time present opportunities to buy good businesses at bargain priceswe do our own research performing indepth fundamental analysis of any company that attracts our attention we avoid the concept of relative valuation and do not believe that a stock is cheap simply because it is selling at lower multiples than its peers furthermore if we are earning an attractive internal return on our investment then we will continue to hold that investment until a more attractive opportunity ariseswe avoid being influenced by shortterm volatility except to take advantage of an opportunity to sell a stock if it becomes overvalued or buy more if it becomes undervalued the speed at which a company’s business success will be recognized by the market is difficult to estimate therefore we do not attempt to time the market and often invest contrary to conventional wisdom if we are right in our analysis a company’s value will be realized over the long termour portfolios are relatively concentrated reflecting a high level of conviction based on our understanding of the businesses we own and the margin of safety incorporated in our analysis  alignment of interestsavenir’s client relationships are based on trust and are best characterized as partnerships our own investments mirror those of our clientsin short “we eat our own cooking”  avenir corporation  top money managers avenir paper craft tools kids
