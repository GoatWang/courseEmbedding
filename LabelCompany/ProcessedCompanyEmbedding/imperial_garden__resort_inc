construction of a premium hotel that will feature a full service hot spring spa and outdoor swimming pools as well as a courtyard garden and a river view that will house water falls restaurants and

period ihg has agreed to provide technical services to us including a review of the hotel building plan for phase i and phase ii in accordance with ihg’s holiday inn standards we have paid the first

channel management for hire service fee licensing fee and system fund contributions          we expect that upon the completion of the two phases described above we will begin to generate higher revenues      the mockup of the natural hot spring spa that is planned to be built in phase i   upon completion of the first two phases discussed above we plan to            · expand clientele for the royal country club spa  resort by undergoing a marketing effort for our additional amenities we intend to focus on marketing to people of different age groups and gender   · provide more services and expand sources of income we intend to increase sources of revenue from  hotel rooms conference centers and wedding venues  charging nature park admission fees  charging admission fees for the floral garden and  providing dining service at the restaurants and bars   · form strategic partnerships in addition to the collaboration with ihg we anticipate developing strategic partnerships on a selective basis for example we have had discussions with several established entertainment companies that have extensive experience in our target markets and have indicated interest in jointly developing the resort   · leverage relationships we are the first to develop and operate a golf resort featuring hot spring spas and natural habitation in taiwan we will continue creating unique or special features to attract customers and increase our market share in the hospitality industry in order to do so we intend to continue to leverage our development expertise existing platform and

december   respectively the net losses attributable to shareholders of our ordinary shares were  and  for the six months ended june   and  respectively as of june   we had  in current assets and  in

the longterm bank loans and notes payable are overdue and currently under negotiation with the lenders as of june   we had liabilities owed to related parties of an aggregate of  including  owed to the shareholders of the company based on the cash flow statement for the six months ended june   we estimate that we are using our funds at a rate of approximately  month we anticipate that at such burning rate our current capital is likely to last two months without further funding   our independent auditor has issued a going concern opinion which means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve  months the financial statements included in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business   our strategy   we plan to shift our business emphasis from the existing golfcentered model to a tourismfocused model we believe that upon the completion of phase i as described above we will be able to attract a broader range of visitors to our resort as a part of our marketing strategy we anticipate designing campaigns and marketing materials that target both domestic and international visitors if we are successful in developing and operating the royal country club spa  resort we intend to apply the same management and operations model to other chain resorts that we may build and operate in the future   competition   in the hospitality and recreation industry we are facing and expect to continue facing extensive competition from competitors of a similar scale in the same or similar industries and sectors we have to keep innovating and upgrading our products and services to maintain our existing clientele and attract new customers to the royal country club and the planned royal country club spa  resort for instances currently the snack bar at the royal country club provides delicious hakka food to our golf customers when the contemplated royal country club spa  resort opens the customers will be able to enjoy the view of the largest garden in taiwan while playing golf therein although our current and future services and products provided at the royal country club and to be provided at the planned royal country club spa  resort are and will be special as compared to the services at traditional golf courses and hotels we may not have effective measures to prevent others imitating our services and products we will be likely to lose customers to other competing golf venues and hotels if those competitors offer similar or more services and products at lower prices   competitive strengths   our competitive strengths in the golf business   we believe the royal country club is one of the leading golf venues in taiwan our strengths in this sector include   ·established scenic golf course and country club we have completed significant renovation of our hole golf course which was

all of the other information included in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our adss we believe the risks and uncertainties described below represent all the material risks known to us that are related to our business and this offering if any of the following risks actually occur they may harm our business financial condition and results of operations in this event the market price of our adss could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment   risks relating to our early stage development and our operations in general   we are in the early stages of our planned expansion and as such we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties the operating history of the golf course that we currently operate and manage may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results upon the completion of our contemplated royal country club spa  resort   while yaoteh has been operating our golf course since  our planned expansion entails the construction development and operations of two hotels and other recreational facilities however we have not had any direct experience in operating hotels retail stores gardens conference centers wedding venues nature hot spring spas and other recreational facilities as a result you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and challenges attendant to the operations of a new business these risks and challenges include   ·the uncertainties associated with our ability to continue our growth while trying to achieve and maintain our profitability ·our ability to establish our competitive position in the high end hotel segment of the lodging industry in taiwan ·our ability to offer innovative products to attract recurring and new customers ·implementing our planned strategy and modifying it from time to time to respond effectively to competition and changes in customer preferences and needs ·increasing awareness of our brand in the resort business and continuing to develop customer loyalty and ·attracting training retaining and motivating skilled and devoted personnel   in addition we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by earlystage companies and those risks and difficulties may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as taiwan some of the risks relate to our ability to   ·complete our construction projects within their anticipated time schedules and budgets ·attract new and retain existing customers and obtain qualified employees ·operate support expand and develop our new and existing projects and facilities ·maintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses ·raise additional capital as required ·develop and maintain internal personnel systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the hospitality business as well as regulatory compliance as a public company ·respond to changes in our regulatory environment and ·respond to competitive market conditions   if we are unable to complete any of these tasks we may be unable to complete all of the royal country club spa  resort that are currently under development operate our golf business in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues from such projects in the amounts and by the times we anticipate if any of these events were to occur it would cause a material adverse effect on our business and prospects financial condition results of operations and cash flows          we have incurred losses in the past and may incur losses in the future   we incurred net losses of  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively we had a total deficit of  and  as of december   and  respectively we expect our costs to increase as we start expanding our business and operations in the hospitality and entertainment industries for instance we estimate that the completion of the royal country club spa  resort requires an investment of approximately  million which will be raised in the form of equity andor debt also the operations of the royal country club may be impacted by the construction of the royal country club spa  resort and therefore negatively influenced the revenue and profits of the golf operations as a result we may incur larger losses in the future we do not think it is reasonable to expect the company to make substantial profits during the construction and initial operation of the royal country club spa  resort we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future   failure to comply with privacy regulations and maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or harm to our reputation and subject us to additional costs fines or lawsuits   certain information regarding our customers including personally identifiable information and credit card numbers is collected and maintained for a period of time for various business purposes including maintaining records of customer preferences to enhance our customer service quality the efficiency of billing and the effects of our marketing and promotional efforts additionally we maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of our customer employee and company data is critical to our business our customers expect that we adequately protect their personal information   the regulations applicable to cyber security and privacy are increasingly demanding privacy regulation is an evolving area and may subject us to various compliance requirements compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to serve our customers and market our golf course and ancillary services to our customers theft loss misappropriation fraudulent or unlawful use of customer employee or company data including cyberattacks could harm our reputation resulting in loss of customers business disruption or increased costs including remedial costs lawsuits or fines in addition noncompliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances noncompliance by third parties engaged by us could result in fines or restrictions on our use or transfer of data any of these matters could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations   the highly concentrated ownership and voting power of the company may impact shareholders’ interests in the company   as of the date hereof mr lo owned approximately  of our ordinary shares and the voting power of the company it is anticipated that mr lo will continue to own a majority of the ordinary shares of the company and correspondingly will have the majority of the voting power of the company as such you may not be able to influence the strategies management or policies of the company as you could at a company where the equity ownership is widely distributed   risks relating to the completion and operation of the royal country club spa  resort   we could encounter problems that substantially increase the costs to develop our royal country club spa  resort and delay or prevent the opening of one or more of our contemplated facilities   the current estimated budget for the phase i and phase ii of the royal country club spa and resort is based on preliminary projections initial conceptual design and schedule estimates that we have prepared with the assistance of our independent architecture and design consultants as of the date of this prospectus the estimated cost to complete the construction and development of the royal country club spa and resort is approximately us million consisting primarily of construction costs design fees professional service fees consulting and management contract fees and the initial operating costs however completion of the resort as envisioned is subject to significant development and construction risks which could have a material adverse impact on our timetables cost budgets and our ability to complete the projects these risks include the following   ·changes to plans and specifications   ·engineering problems including defective plans and specifications   ·shortages of and price increases in energy materials and skilled and unskilled labor and inflation in key supply markets   ·delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary permits licenses and approvals          ·changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to leisure residential real estate development or construction projects and tourists’ permits for people from mainland china   ·labor disputes or work stoppages   ·disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors   ·environmental health and safety issues including site accidents   ·weather interferences   ·fires typhoons and other natural disasters   ·geological construction excavation regulatory and equipment problems and   ·other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases   the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs cause delays prevent the construction or opening of any of our contemplated facilities or otherwise affect the design and features of the planned royal country club spa  resort   we may be required to incur significant additional indebtedness or other equity or equitylinked securities in order to complete construction and development of the royal country club spa  resort our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited which could delay or prevent the opening or completion of our royal country club spa  resort   we think that it is highly likely that we will require additional funding to complete the construction and development of the royal country club spa  resort as well as to fund initial operating activities and to service existing debt payments we estimate that we would need approximately  million to complete the construction and start the initial operations of the entire royal country club spa  resort as contemplated in addition to the funds raised in this offering assuming that we succeed in raising the maximum amount of capital through this offering if delays and cost overruns are significant the additional funding required could be substantial which we will need to obtain either through equity issuances or debt financing the raising of additional debt by us if required could result in the imposition of operating and financing covenants or liens on our assets that could significantly restrict our operations in addition the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders’ interest in the company   further our ability to obtain required capital on acceptable terms when required is subject to a variety of uncertainties including   ·limitations on our ability to incur additional debt including as a result of prospective lenders’ evaluations of our creditworthiness and pursuant to restrictions imposed by our existing and anticipated credit facilities   ·limitations on our ability to raise capital from the credit markets if the credit markets decline due to any large scale defaults originating from overleveraged chinese companies in taiwan and china   ·investors’ and lenders’ perception of and demand for debt and equity securities of leisure and hospitality companies as well as competing offerings of financing and investment opportunities in taiwan by our competitors   ·whether it is necessary to provide credit support or other assurances for our subsidiaries yaoteh and tatehfu   ·conditions of the us taiwan china hong kong and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise additional funds   ·our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows   ·taiwan and chinese regulations on transferring funds between taiwan and china and   ·economic political and other conditions in taiwan china and the great asian region          as such we cannot assure you that the necessary financing if and when required by us will be available in the future in the amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all if we fail to raise additional funds in such amounts and at such times as we may need we may be forced to reduce our expenditures and stay at a level that can be supported by our cash flow and delay the development of the royal country club spa  resort without necessary capital we may not be able to   ·develop and complete any new projects contemplated by our board of directors   ·acquire necessary rights assets or businesses   ·expand our operations in taiwan   ·hire train and retain employees for the resort to be constructed   ·market our services and products or   ·respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated funding requirements   even if the royal country club spa  resort is completed as planned it may not be financially successful which would limit our cash flow and would adversely affect our operations   even if all of the planned facilities contemplated within the royal country club spa  resort are completed as planned no assurance can be given that its operations will be financially successful or generate the cash flows that we require to sustain its operation we may not attract the level of patronage that we anticipate if we are unable to attract sufficient business it would limit our cash flow and adversely affect our operations our financial condition and our ability to service payments under any of our loan facilities   our future resort operating results are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry in general and our returndriven development model is subject to certain risks   our operating results of the contemplated resort are subject to conditions typically affecting the lodging industry which include   ·changes and volatility in general economic conditions ·our ability to maintain or increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers ·competition from other hotels and fullservice resorts ·natural disasters or travelers’ fears of exposure to contagious diseases and social unrest ·seasonality of our business ·changes in travel patterns or in the desirability of particular locations such as miaoli ·increases in operating costs and expenses due to inflation and other factors ·local market conditions such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms ·the quality and performance of the future managers and other employees of our planned hotels ·the availability and cost of capital to allow us to fund construction and renovation of and make other investments in our hotels entertainment facilities and ancillary equipment and ·the possibility that our leased properties may be subject to challenges as to their compliance with the relevant government regulations   in addition our returndriven development model is subject to the following risks   ·we may not be able to control our costs effectively as anticipated and ·lack of resort operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations of the planned resort   changes in any of the conditions typically affecting the lodging industry in general and the materialization of any risks applicable to our returndriven development model could adversely affect our occupancy rates average daily rates and revenues generated per available room “rev par” or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   we expect to incur significant preopening expenses at the development stage and generate relatively low revenues at the rampup stage which may have a significant negative impact on our financial performance   we mainly utilize a buildandoperate model under which the operation of our hotel goes through three stages development rampup and mature operations during the development stage hotels and the accommodations generally incur preopening expenses during the rampup stage when the occupancy rate is still relatively low revenues generated by hotels may be insufficient to cover their operating costs which are relatively fixed in nature as a result our contemplated hotels may not achieve profitability until they reach mature operations this may have a significant negative impact on our financial performance during the development and rampup stages          our business is sensitive to global or regional economic crises a severe or prolonged downturn in the global taiwanese or asian economy could cause a sharp reduction of expenditure on our planned resort and therefore materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations   the recent  economic recession in china has been challenging uncertainty in credit availability rising unemployment and slow recovery from sluggish corporate operating and earning performance in certain major economies have continued in  capital market volatility remains at high levels as a result of investors’ continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential longterm and widespread recession geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and the housing and mortgage markets the weak economic outlook has negatively affected business and consumer confidence and contributed to slow recoveries and low growth rates in most industries around the world   our contemplated resort is located in miaoli where the local economy heavily depends upon tourism including international visitors from china south korea japan united states and other southeastern asian countries although there have been signs of recovery since the global financial debacle in  originated in united states there are still great uncertainties regarding economic conditions and the demand for luxurious hotels and golf courses in our targeted markets such as taiwan and china such uncertainties may adversely impact our results of operations of the planned resort continued turbulence in the international markets may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including our ability to access capital markets to meet our liquidity needs and fund the construction and development of our contemplated resort   we have not entered into any construction contracts or negotiated with any construction companies regarding the construction of the royal country club spa  resort which may increase the risk of delay   we have not entered into any construction contracts or negotiated with any construction companies regarding the construction of the royal country club spa  resort which may increase the risk of delay we currently have not made any plans regarding hiring construction companies such other engaging with a general contractor that will be responsible for finding subcontractors or directly with separate contractors that will build different parts of the royal country club spa  resort if we did not find competent and diligent construction companies for a reasonable price or found such companies after an extended period of time longer than we expected it would increase the risks of delaying the construction and operation of the royal country club spa  resort   our contractors may face difficulties in finding sufficient labor at acceptable cost which could cause delays and increase construction costs of the royal country club spa  resort   the contractors we intend to retain to construct our royal country club spa  resort may face difficulties in finding qualified construction laborers and managers as many projects commence construction in taiwan and as substantial construction activities continue in china immigration and labor regulations and political tension in taiwan may cause our contractors to be unable to obtain sufficient laborers from china to make up any gaps in available labor in taiwan and to reduce costs of construction which could cause delays and increase construction costs of our projects   we may encounter common risks associated with construction of hotel buildings and facilities of similar scales   we expect to be exposed to general risks associated with construction of buildings and facilities for resorts including but not limited to failure to obtain or not obtaining in a timely manner the necessary government licenses permits and approvals construction delays budget overruns and construction contract disputes in addition we might experience increased holding costs as a result of delays we have not yet entered into all of the definitive contracts necessary for the construction and development of the resort such as construction contracts and recreational facility management contracts we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into definitive contracts with contractors and consulting companies with sufficient skills financial strength and experience on commercially reasonable terms or at all we have not and may not be able to obtain guaranteed maximum price or fixed contract price terms on the construction contracts for the resort which could cause us to bear greater risks of cost overruns and construction delays if we are unable to enter into satisfactory construction contracts for the royal country club spa  resort or are unable to closely control the construction costs and timetable for the projects our business financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected          our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses that we may suffer from our planned royal country club spa  resort in addition our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future   we plan to purchase insurance policies providing coverage for construction risks that we believe we may be subject to regarding the construction of the royal country club spa  resort the insurance policies that we expect to purchase will include the life insurance for the construction workers and executive officers construction materials as well as buildings and fixtures under construction however this insurance coverage may exclude certain types of loss and damage such as loss or damage resulting from acts of terrorism or liability for death or illness caused by contagious or infectious diseases if loss or damage of those types were to occur we could suffer significant uninsured losses further the cost of coverage may in the future become so high that we may be unable to maintain the insurance policies we deem necessary for the construction and operations of our projects on commercially practicable terms or at all or we may need reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage we cannot assure you that any such insurance policies we may obtain will be adequate to protect us from material losses   construction at our projects is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses which may not be covered by our contemplated insurance policies   the construction of large scale properties such as our royal country club spa  resort can be dangerous construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life thereby subjecting the contractors and us to liabilities possible losses delays in completion of the projects and negative publicity we believe that we and our contractors take safety precautions that are consistent with the industry practice but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injury or loss of life damage to property or delays if any accidents occur during the construction of our projects we may be subject to delays including delays imposed by regulators liabilities and possible losses which may not be covered by our insurance and therefore our business prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected   we need the development permit construction license and operation license to develop and operate the royal country club spa  resort if we do not obtain the appropriate licenses and permits we would not be able to construct and use the facilities as contemplated and therefore would not be able to open and operate the resort as planned   we are required to comply with real property and zoning law to ensure that we can build and operate the royal country club spa  resort as intended according to the letter issued from chang chenbin architecture firm dated october   we need to file our development plan of the royal country club spa  resort the land and water reservation plan and the environmental impact report with the miaoli county to obtain the development permit for our contemplated resort   chang chenbin architecture firm plans to file the development plan by december   and estimates that it may take approximately eight months to get the development permit the risks involved in obtaining the development permit are that the review process by a committee from the miaoli county may take longer than what the architecture firm has expected if for any reason the royal country club spa  resort operates without the proper licenses and permits it would be subject to fines ranging from  to  of the contract price and be further required to obtain the necessary licenses and permits   upon obtaining the development permit chang chenbin architecture firm will apply for the construction license to allow us to begin building the resort while yicheng huang the company’s consultant simultaneously assists us in reclassifying our land as a special golf district for entertainment purposes the land reclassification allows construction on our land and the construction license allows us to begin construction as explained below our consultant estimates that it may take up to eighteen months from february  to reclassify the land failure to obtain any of the development permit land reclassification or the construction license would prevent us from constructing any part of the resort as contemplated   once the resort is completed chang chenbin architecture firm will on behalf of the company apply for the operation license which will allow us to operate the resort as currently contemplated   we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the development permit construction license and operation license or obtain such permits and licenses in a timely manner if we did not successfully obtain any of the licenses or permits described herein in a timely manner we would have to make abrupt changes to our business plan and development strategy which would negatively impact our business and operations          the simultaneous planning constructing and developing our royal country club spa  resort and operating the golf course may strain our management time and resources which could lead to delays increased costs and other inefficiencies in the development of the resort or operation of the golf course   the planning designing and construction of phase i and phase ii of the royal country club spa  resort will proceed simultaneously with our operation of the golf course this construction timetable enables us to maintain certain cash flow and revenue while the royal country club spa  resort is being constructed however this would entail a significant amount of time and resources from members of our management which may divert their attention from overseeing the daytoday operations of the golf course   we will need to recruit a substantial number of new employees before each of our projects can open and competition may limit our ability to attract qualified management and personnel   we require extensive operational management and staff to open and operate the resort accordingly we need to undertake a major recruiting program before the opening of the hotels and other comprising the royal country club spa  resort the pool of experienced hospitality and other skilled personnel in taiwan is limited many of our new personnel will occupy sensitive positions requiring qualifications sufficient to meet high standards in the hospitality industry or will be required to possess other skills which entail substantial training and experience moreover competition to recruit and retain qualified hospitality and other personnel is likely to intensify further as competition increases in the hospitality market in taiwan other major resort hotels such as a renaissance hotel of the marriott family in taipei are expected to open in taiwan at or around the same time as our resort we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to operate our recreational and entertainment facilities or that costs to recruit and retain such personnel will not increase our inability to attract and retain qualified employees and senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future business operations   our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and ihg’s expertise and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose any of their services or if their other responsibilities cause them to be unable to devote sufficient time and attention to the company   we place substantial reliance on the project development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the taiwan and great asia markets possessed by members of our senior management team including chairman mr funming lo and ihg which agrees to provide hotel management technical support and operational services to our hotel to be completed first the loss of the services of one or more of these members of our senior management team could hinder our ability to effectively manage our current business and implement our growth and development strategies as planned finding suitable replacements for mr funming lo or other members of our senior management could be difficult if not impossible and competition for personnel of similar experience could be intense   we plan to with assistance from ihg start recruiting hotel management and operation teams in the fourth quarter of  we or ihg may fail to employ suitable or competent talents to operate and manage any of our contemplated hotels and recreational facilities the unsuccessful or less than satisfactory operations of any of our planned business lines would exert adverse effect on the financial performance of our entire company   the lodging industry in taiwan is highly competitive and growing rapidly in the past few years and if we are unable to compete successfully our financial condition and results of operations may be harmed   the lodging industry in taiwan is intensively competitive in  as the supply for lodging exceeded the demand according to a news article published on win shang news one of the real estate industry publications in china in the past three years since  more than one hundred brand new hotels have been constructed per year in taiwan many of the existing hotels in our targeted markets may be more fully developed and have more revenue to finance ongoing operations than us upon opening of our hotels we will compete primarily with other high end hotels as well as fullservice resorts where the competition is mainly based on location room rates entertainment facilities brand recognition the quality of the accommodations and service levels in addition we may face competition from new entrants in the upscale hotel segment and the golf resort segment in taiwan furthermore we compete with all other hotels for guests primarily from taiwan china and southeast asian countries our typical business customers and leisure travelers may change their travel spending and consumption patterns and choose hotels in different segments new and existing competitors may offer more competitive rates more comprehensive accommodation packages greater convenience services or amenities or superior facilities which could result in a decrease in occupancy and average daily rates of our hotel rooms any of these factors may have an adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations and financial condition          our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics natural disasters and other catastrophes   our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics natural disasters and other catastrophes particularly in the location where we plan to operate the resort   our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of swine influenza avian influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” or other epidemics in  reports surfaced regarding occurrences of swine influenza and fears of a global pandemic cases of swine influenza were later confirmed in numerous countries including taiwan and china in early  several economies in asia including taiwan were affected by the outbreak of sars taiwan adopted certain hygiene measures including quarantining visitors from places where any of the contagious diseases described above were rampant those restrictive measures adversely affected the performance of the tourism and hospitality industries during that period any prolonged recurrence of such contagious disease or other adverse public health developments in taiwan or our targeted markets may have a material and adverse effect on our business operations for example if any of our employees or customers was suspected of having contracted any contagious disease while he or she has worked or stayed in our hotels we might have been under certain circumstances required to quarantine our employees or customers that were affected and the affected areas of our premises losses caused by epidemics natural disasters and other catastrophes including earthquakes or typhoons are either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against in taiwan in the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel or recreational facility as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel or facility in that event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any financial commitments related thereto   similarly wars including the potential of war terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity social unrest and heightened travel security measures instituted in response travelrelated accidents as well as geopolitical uncertainty and international conflict will affect travel and may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we may not be adequately prepared in contingency planning or recovery capability in relation to a major incident or crisis and as a result our operational continuity may be adversely and materially affected which in turn may harm our reputation   if we are unable to access funds to maintain our hotels’ condition and appearance as planned the attractiveness of our hotels and our reputation could suffer and our hotel occupancy rates may decline   in order to maintain outstanding conditions and appearance of our planned hotels ongoing renovations and other leasehold improvements including periodic replacement of furniture fixtures and equipment will be required such investments and expenditures require ongoing funding and to the extent we cannot fund these expenditures from our existing cash or cash flow generated from operations we must borrow or raise capital through financing we may not be able to access capital or willing to spend available capital when other higher prioritized projects require the investment if we fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties that we plan to build our resort’s attractiveness and reputation could deteriorate we could lose our market share to our competitors and our hotel occupancy rates and rev par may decline   interruption or failure of our information systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our services that are planned to be provided at the royal country club spa  resort which could damage our reputation   our ability to provide consistent and highquality services and monitor our operations on a realtime basis for our resort including the hotels restaurants golf course conference centers and other facilities depends on the establishment and operations of our information technology systems such as our web property management central reservation and customer relationship management systems any damage to or failure of our systems could interrupt our inventory management affect the manner of our services in terms of efficiency consistency and quality and reduce our customer satisfaction          our technology platform will play a central role in our management of inventory revenues and loyalty programs furthermore we will rely on our website and call center to facilitate customer reservations our systems will be vulnerable to damages or interruptions as a result of power loss or telecommunications failures and operations relying on the system such as reservation and billing will have to be conducted offline or manually computer viruses fires floods earthquakes interruptions in access to our tollfree numbers hacking or other attempts to harm our systems and other similar events will potentially interfere with our normal business operations some of our systems will not be fully redundant and our disaster recovery plan does not account for all possible scenarios furthermore our systems and technologies including our website and database could contain undetected errors or “bugs” that could adversely affect their performance or could become outdated and we may not be able to replace or introduce upgraded systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs for such upgrades if we experience system failures our quality of services customer satisfaction and operational efficiency could be severely harmed which could also adversely affect our reputation   if the value of our products and services or image thereof diminishes it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations   we plan to offer two hotels amenities and entertainment facilities that are designed to target elite customers our success in establishing maintaining and enhancing our brand and image depends to a large extent on our ability to satisfy customer needs by further developing and maintaining our innovative and distinctive products and maintaining consistent premium quality of services across our resort as well as our ability to respond to competitive pressures if we were unable to do so our occupancy rates might have declined which could in turn have adversely affected our results of operations our business might have also been adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be diminished by the insufficient or ineffective operations of any part of our resort whether due to unsatisfactory service accidents or otherwise if the value of our products or image was diminished or our products did not appeal to customers our results of operations might have been materially and adversely affected   we are subject to various hospitality construction hygiene safety and environmental laws and regulations that may subject us to liability   our contemplated resort business is subject to various compliance and operational requirements under taiwanese laws for example see “regulation — regulations on hotel operations” furthermore new regulations may be adopted in the future to increase our compliance efforts at significant costs if certain of our hotels were not in full compliance with all of the applicable requirements such as environmental health and safety laws we might have been subject to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or the suspension of operations and development activities of the company   the growth of thirdparty online and other hotel reservation intermediaries and travel consolidators may adversely affect our margins and profitability   ihg or other hotel management teams may have some of our hotel rooms booked through thirdparty online and other hotel reservation intermediaries and consolidators to whom we pay commissions for such services they may be able to negotiate higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us we believe that such intermediaries and consolidators would attempt to develop and increase customer loyalty toward their reservation systems rather than ours as a result the growth and increasing importance of these travel intermediaries and consolidators may adversely affect our ability to control the supply and pricing of our room inventory which would in turn adversely affect our margins and profitability   risks relating to our golf operations   economic recessions or downturns could negatively affect our golf business financial condition and results of the golf operations   a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary or leisure spending by golfers and such spending can be particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions an economic downturn in taiwan could result in slower business activities increased unemployment concerns about inflation and energy costs and lower consumer confidence any such downturn is likely to result in reduced spending on leisure activities such as golfing as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by such an economic downturn with reduced number of golfers on our golf course during an economic downturn we may be unable to increase our fees which may contribute to decreased revenues and financial losses          we may not be able to attract and retain golfers to utilize our golf properties when we start construction of the royal country club spa  resort which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations   the level of attractiveness of our golf course to the market is critically important to our success our success heavily depends on our ability to retain existing players and attract new customers to our golf properties changes in consumer tastes and preferences particularly those affecting the popularity of golf dining options and other social trends could adversely affect our business in addition the contemplated phase i and phase ii construction could dissuade our clients because transporting construction resources and the construction itself may generate the noise untidy environment and interruption to the golf activities although phase i construction will be conducted away from the golf course and the golf course will be closed during the phase ii construction period   certain factors beyond our control may change consumer spending patterns particularly in the area of discretionary expenditures for leisure and recreation resulting in potential reduced demand for our golf services   certain factors beyond our control may change consumer spending patterns particularly in the area of discretionary expenditures for leisure and recreation resulting in potential reduced demand for our golf services these factors include   ·natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes typhoons wild fires and floods ·outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as avian or swine flu and ·terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events   these factors and other global national and regional conditions may adversely affect individual golf properties or certain regions or industries as a whole any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce the demand for our services and in turn could harm our business and results of operations   unusual weather patterns and extreme weather conditions as well as seasonality could adversely affect the demand for our golf services or impact our business and results of operations and our ads price   our operations of the golf course are susceptible to seasonal and severe weather patterns extreme weather conditions such as heavy rains extremely high temperature and droughts could reduce our revenues by interrupting or interfering activities on our premises which could negatively impact our business and operations our golf course business usually declines during winters when the daytime is short and temperature is low with respect to seasonality april under which the strawberry season falls accounts for a higher percentage of our revenues than other months of the year   particularly our golf course is sensitive to availability of water a significantly large quantity of water is needed to maintain the condition of turf grass at a satisfactory level to entertain golfers despite of access to natural lakes our ability to irrigate our golf course could be adversely impacted by a drought or water shortage caused by human such as government imposed water restrictions a severe drought over an extensive duration could adversely affect our business and results of operations   competition in the golf industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations   we will operate in a significantly competitive industry and will compete primarily on the basis of reputation featured facilities location quality and breadth of product offerings and pricing as a result competition for market share in the golf industry is intensive to succeed we must have a strong position respecting the market share of golfing and develop new golfers in the taiwan market the number of golf properties in our geographic region may exceed the demand thereof which could significantly impact our ability to attract and retain golfers   increases in our cost of goods water utilities and taxes could reduce our operating margins and harm our business financial condition and results of operations   increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors may not be directly offset by increased revenue we anticipate that our operating costs will include labor cost of goods water utilities and taxes many and in some cases all of the factors affecting these costs will be beyond our control if we are not able to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices or others our operating margins would suffer which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          the prices of utilities are volatile and shortages of utilities occur sometimes in particular our golf properties may be subject to restrictions regarding the use of water for irrigation significant increases in the costs of our utilities or any shortages could interrupt or curtail our operations and lower our operating margins which would have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   we are in the process of amending our licenses and permits for the formal golf operation the denial of or delay of obtaining any of which would cause disruptive impact on our current business operation and therefore harm our business and result of operations   we received the development permit and five construction licenses to build a hole golf course and three operation licenses for the hole golf course which has been in operation since its establishment due to policy changes and ownership disputes over certain lots of land inside the territory of the planned hole golf course we had to switch from the original plan of a hole golf course to the plan of an hole golf course as a result of the change of plan we applied and obtained the new development permit for the hole golf course which had been completed as part of the planned hole golf course we are currently in the process of amending the construction license and the land and water reservation plan in order to reclassify the land as golf special district for entertainment purposes after reclassification of the land we will apply for the operation license from the miaoli county to operate the hole golf course on a full scale   presently we are operating the golf course on a test basis and as such we are not permitted to host golf tournaments yicheng huang a consultant who is in charge of obtaining all the licenses and permits for the hole golf course estimates that it would take approximately  months from february  to reclassify the land we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain all the license and permits to operate the existing golf course on a full scale failure to obtain or obtain in a timely fashion all necessary licenses and permits will prevent or delay the process of operating our golf course with all of its functionality   the construction of phase i of the royal country club spa resort may interrupt the regular operation of the golf course and therefore is likely to cause adverse impact on the operation results of the golf course   the management of our company plans to construct the hotel and other facilities for phase i of royal country club spa resort during which the golf course remains in operation although the construction site of phase i is located to the north of the golf course and does not have any overlapping area with the golf course there is possibility that the construction will cause disruptive or interruptive impact to golfing activities on the royal country club the noise extra traffic dust dirt and waste caused by the construction project will likely have adverse impact on our golfing activities we cannot guarantee that the construction of phase i will not harm our operation results of the golf course during the period thereof   accidents or injuries at our golf properties or in connection with our operations may subject as to liability and accidents or injuries could negatively impact our reputation and play at our golf properties which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations   there are risks of accidents or injuries on our golf properties or in connection with our operations and activities including but not limited to injuries caused by slips and falls on our premises if accidents or injuries occur on our golf properties we may be held liable for costs related to the injuries although yaoteh has purchased liability insurance against injuries caused by accidents occurred on the golf course property insurance against damages to the properties on the premises and insurance against terrorist attacks for the year ended june  there can be no assurance that the coverage will be sufficient to pay off all or any of its liabilities during the insured period or yaoteh will obtain any such insurance at a reasonable price after the insured period our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed to the extent that claims and associated expenses resulting from accidents or injuries exceed our current insurance coverage if there is any          our operations will subject us to environmental regulations which create uncertainty regarding our future environmental expenses and liabilities   our golf properties are regulated by certain environmental laws we may be required to incur costs to comply with these laws such as laws related to water resources discharges to air water and land the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and possibly the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials pursuant to the environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances on or chemical releases from our golf properties environmental laws may impose on us the cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants we may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic pursuant to such laws and in the future we may incur costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historical uses of our golf properties and for our treatment storage or disposal of wastes on any of our golf properties when they were owned by other preceding entities the costs of investigation remediation or renewal of regulated materials may be substantial and the presence of any such substances or the failure to remediate any golf property properly may impair our ability to use our golf properties we may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards mitigate environmental risks in the future or comply with other environmental requirements   our insurance on the golf business may not be adequate to cover all the losses that we may suffer from our golf operations   we currently have property insurance on the golfing machinery and equipment accidental fire insurance on our real property and fixtures and accident insurance on all of our personal and real property if we incur losses or damages for which we are held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our insurance coverage our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected for example certain casualty events such as labor strikes nuclear events acts of war loss of income due to cancellation of golf reservations deterioration or corrosion of the golf course land insect or animal damages and pollution may not be covered under our policies as a result certain acts and events could expose us to significant uninsured losses in addition to the damages caused directly by a casualty loss such as acts of war or terrorism we may suffer a disruption of our business as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties who may be injured or harmed while we intend to obtain business interruption insurance and general liability insurance such insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and in any event may not be adequate to cover all losses that may result from such events   our costs and expenses may remain constant or increase even if our revenues decline which would adversely affect our net margins and results of operations   a significant portion of our operating costs including leases and employee base salaries is fixed accordingly a decrease in revenues could result in a disproportionately higher decrease in our earnings because our operating costs and expenses are unlikely to decrease proportionately for example winter time before the chinese new year generally accounts for a lower portion of our annual revenues than other time of the year but our expenses do not vary as significantly with changes in occupancy and revenues as we need to continue to pay equipment leases and employee salaries make regular repairs maintenance and renovations and invest in other improvements throughout the year to maintain the attractiveness of our contemplated hotels furthermore our property development and renovation costs may increase as a result of an increase in the cost of materials however we have limited ability to pass the increased portion of the costs to customers through golf admission fee or membership fee increases therefore our costs and expenses may remain constant or increase even if our revenues decline which would adversely affect our net margins and results of operations   risks relating to doing business outside of the united states   because our headquarters are located outside of the us and our business will be conducted outside of the us we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including periodic foreign economic downturns and political instability which may adversely affect our revenue and cost of doing business in taiwan          foreign economic downturns may affect our results of operations in the future additionally other facts relating to the operation of our business outside of the us may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including   ·international economic and political changes ·the imposition of governmental controls or changes in government regulations including tax laws regulations and treaties ·changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements regarding golf properties and resort properties ·compliance with us and international laws involving international operations including the foreign corrupt practices act and export control laws ·difficulties in achieving headcount reductions due to unionized labor and works councils ·restrictions on transfers of funds and assets between jurisdictions and ·china taiwan geopolitical instability   as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks the impact of any one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   we face substantial political risks associated with doing business in taiwan particularly due to domestic political events and the rigid relationship between the roc and the prc that could negatively affect our operations and the value of your investment   our principal executive office and substantially all of our assets are located in taiwan and substantially all of our revenues are derived from our operations in taiwan accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our adss may be affected by changes in governmental policies taxation inflation or interest rates social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting taiwan   for example in  a mass movement formed calling for the resignation of the president of taiwan over a series of alleged corruption scandals and staged dramatic protests in addition taiwan has a unique international political status since  taiwan and mainland china or prc have been separately governed by different political parties the prc claims that it is the sole government in china including taiwan while some political parties in roc claim roc’s independence or roc as the only legitimate government of china including taiwan and china there was a time when the two governments prohibited all and any of trades transactions and trips crossing the taiwan strait although significant economic and cultural relations have been established in the recent years between the roc and the prc relations have often been strained the prc government has refused to renounce the use of military force to regain control over taiwan furthermore the prc government has passed an antisecession law in march  which has authorized the government to use all necessary measures including nonpeaceful means against taiwan’s independence movement in the event of such declaration in february of  the then president of taiwan ceased all activities in the country’s national unification council a committee established to assist taiwan in its efforts to reunite with the prc such cessation is commonly viewed as having a detrimental effect on the relations between the two sides some of past development of the relationship between the roc and the prc has depressed the market prices of the securities of several taiwanese companies the recent situation of no dialogue between taiwan and mainland china is followed by an approximate  decline of arrivals from mainland china to taiwan in  such unstable relationship between the roc and the prc could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our securities    ralph jennings taiwan sees  decline in tourists from china here’s the impact forbes jul   httpwwwforbescomsitesralphjenningsasnapshotoftaiwanafterthecutbackinchinesetouristsed          adverse changes in the political and economic policies of china could have a material and adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china which could adversely affect our competitive position   chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including the level of governmental involvement the growth rate control of foreign exchange rates and the methods of allocating resources for instance the prc government exercises significant control over its economic growth through the allocation of resources control of incurrence and payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations establishment of monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries changes in any of these policies laws and regulations could adversely affect the overall economy in the prc including the golf industry in which we operate and the hospitality industry into which we plan to enter while the chinese economy has grown significantly in the past thirty years the growth has not been consistent recently chinese economy is going through a significant downturn which has had negative effects on other economies in the world   approximately  of our customers are from the prc accordingly our business results of operations financial condition and prospects are subject to economic political and legal developments in china although the chinese economy is no longer a planned economy the chinese government continues to exercise significant control over its economic growth through direct allocation of resources monetary and tax policies restrictions on foreign investment in certain industries limitations on foreign currency exchanges and restrictions on the development of specific industries or markets   in response to the economic downturn the prc government has adopted certain policies to stimulate the economic growth in china if the chinese policies fail to achieve any of the goals and any aspect of the policies limits the growth of our industries or otherwise negatively affects our businesses our growth rate strategy or results of operations could be adversely affected   we cannot assure you that any of the various monetary policies and economic stimulus actions adopted by the chinese government will be effective to bring back the chinese economy on a fast growth track as it was   we may be exposed to liabilities under the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and chinese anticorruption law   we are subject to the fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments foreign government officials and political parties by us persons as defined by the statute for purposes of obtaining or retaining businesses we are also subject to chinese anticorruption law which strictly prohibits bribes to government officials we may have agreements with third parties who may make sales in china and us during the process of which we may be exposed to corruption activities in taiwan create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by an employee consultant or agent of the company because these parties are not always subject to our control   although we believe to date we have complied in all material aspects with the provisions of the fcpa and chinese anticorruption law our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and any of our employees consultants or agents may engage in corruptive conduct for which we might be held responsible violations of the fcpa or chinese anticorruption law may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions against the company and individuals and therefore could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition the taiwanese government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or which we acquire   if we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny criticism and negative publicity involving uslisted chinese companies we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matters any unfavorable results from the investigations could harm our business operations this offering and our reputation   recently us public companies that have substantially all of their operations in china have been subjects of intense scrutiny criticism and negative publicity by investors financial commentators and regulatory agencies such as the sec much of the scrutiny criticism and negative publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities lack of effective internal control over financial accountings inadequate corporate governance and ineffective implementation thereof and in many cases allegations of fraud as a result of enhanced scrutiny criticism and negative publicity the publicly traded stocks of many us listed chinese companies have sharply decreased in value and in some cases have become virtually worthless or illiquid many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and sec enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations it is not clear what effects the sectorwide investigations will have on our company our business and this offering if we become a subject of any unfavorable allegations whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and defend the company if such allegations were not proven to be groundless the company and our business operations would be severely hampered and the price of your stock of the company could decline substantially if such allegations were proven to be groundless the investigation might have significantly distracted our management’s attention          international operations expose us to currency exchange and repatriation risks and we cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operating results   we have substantially all business operations in taiwan we have exposure to currency fluctuations because our sales and purchases are denominated in new taiwan dollars we cannot assure you that the effect of currency exchange fluctuations will not materially affect our revenues and net income in the future   if taiwan’s transportation infrastructure does not adequately support the development of taiwan’s hospitality industry visitation to taiwan may not increase as currently expected which may cause our projects to be unsuccessful   taiwan is an island and separated by taiwan strait a strait of  kilometers  miles in width from china therefore air transportation plays a critical role in its external relations there are many civilian airports in taiwan two of which are international taoyuan international airport “tpe” and kaohsiung international airport “khh” serving approximately  international air routes with coverage of china united states japan singapore philippines thailand indonesia and hong kong three main railway lines in taiwan west line east line and south circle line together with branch railway lines form a complete circle on the island numerous long distance buses and local bus lines serve the need for ground transportation   to support taiwan’s planned transformation into a massmarket tourism destination the frequency of bus plane and ferry services to taiwan must increase significantly in addition taiwan’s internal road system is prone to congestion and collapses or landslides under severe weather conditions and therefore must be substantially improved to support projected increases in traffic while various projects are under development to improve taiwan’s internal and external transportation links these projects may not be approved financed or constructed in time to handle the projected increase in demand for transportation or at all which could impede the expected increase in visitation to taiwan and cause our royal country club spa  resort to be not as successful as expected   risks relating to our indebtedness   our current projected and potential future indebtedness could impair our financial condition which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage   we expect to incur based on current budgets and estimates secured or unsecured longterm indebtedness including a portion of approximately us  primarily for the development and construction of phase ii of the royal country club spa  resort   our significant indebtedness could have important consequences to you for example it could   ·increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions   ·impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes   ·require us to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the funds available to us for our operations or investment in operations          ·limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our golf and hospitality businesses and the industries thereof   ·subject us to higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates to the extent a portion of our debt will bear interest at variable rates   ·cause us to incur additional expenses by hedging interest rate exposures of our debt and exposure to hedging counterparties’ failure to pay under such hedging arrangements which would reduce the funds available for our operations and   ·in the event we or one of our subsidiaries were to default over secured indebtedness result in the loss of all or a substantial portion of our and our subsidiaries’ assets in which our lenders would take security interest   servicing the debt of our subsidiaries requires a significant amount of cash and our subsidiaries may not generate a sufficient level of cash flow from their businesses to make scheduled payments on their debt   on july   yaoteh entered a fouryear loan agreement with taiwan business bank to borrow an amount of ntd approximately  to purchase land for the development and construction of the royal country club in turn taiwan business bank held a mortgage on yaoteh’s land to secure its loan the loan went into default on july   on june   yaoteh entered into a fiveyear repayment schedule with taiwan business bank to repay the principal and interest of the loan in an amount of  as of june   and december   yaoteh’s remaining loan balance with taiwan business bank were  and  respectively in addition yaoteh had three defaulted loans with aggregate unpaid outstanding balances of  and  as of june   and december   respectively with respect to notes payable yaoteh had two notes outstanding due to two individuals in an aggregate amount of  as of december   one of the individual lenders held liens on the golf course to secure its loan which is overdue and currently under negotiation   on december   tatehfu renewed its fiveyear term loan balance with taiwan cooperative bank and converted it into revolving line of credit subject to annual renewal which is secured by twentysix parcels of land owned by tatehfu in aggregate of  acre and guaranteed by shuhui chou the sole managing members of tatehfu and ms chou’s brother as of june   and december   tatehfu had outstanding balances against taiwan cooperative bank in amounts of  and  respectively   each of our subsidiaries’ ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance their indebtedness depends on our subsidiaries’ future performance which is subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our subsidiaries may not generate enough cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service their debt and make necessary capital expenditures if they are unable to generate such cash flow our subsidiaries may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling the secured assets restructuring debt incurring additional indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our subsidiaries’ ability to refinance their indebtedness will also depend on the financial markets and their financial condition at such time our subsidiaries may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our subsidiaries’ debt obligations and a material adverse effect on the value of our adss   default of any loans that are secured by any of our subsidiaries’ land could materially and adversely affect our operations development plans and our financial condition   if there is a default under one of our subsidiaries’ secured debt facilities the holder of the debt on which we defaulted may cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately as the terms of the loan permit further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness at our subsidiaries that own or operate our properties the lenders with those secured debt facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in that event the change of the ownership or control of such land will adversely impact or disrupt our business operations   our ability to continue as a company depends on the availability of future financing and the success of our future operations   our auditor has issued a going concern opinion on our combined financial statements for the years ended december   and  which is premised on our ability to recover the company’s assets and satisfy the liabilities in the ordinary course of business this basis presumes that funds will be available to finance ongoing research development operations expansions and capital expenditures and permit the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of operations for the foreseeable future   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully secure sources of financing and attain profitable operations however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing on reasonable terms and operating profitable businesses   we have accumulated a large amount of debts owed to its shareholders which are due upon demand   our two subsidiaries yaoteh and tatehfu have advanced funds from certain shareholders for working capital purposes both subsidiaries have not entered into any written agreement with these shareholders in respect of the advances which as of december   were  the advances are due upon demand by the shareholders although they bear no interest we would face financial hardship if any of the shareholders who advanced funds to us demanded repayments of a substantial amount at the same time or within a short period of time in order to repay the advances if demanded we may divert part of our working capital to pay off the debts due and as a result our financial operations will be substantially interrupted due to lack of operating capital          the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations and harm our ability to complete our projects and grow our business operations to compete successfully against our competitors   we may enter into security documents that contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the operations of the golf course andor the resort contemplated the common covenants in security documents generally restrict or limit among other things our and our subsidiaries’ ability to   ·incur additional debt including guarantees   ·create security or liens that are senior to the security or encumbrances created thereby   ·dispose of assets without proper consents   ·make certain acquisitions and investments   ·pay dividends including to our shareholders and ads holders during the construction of the royal country club spa  resort   ·make other restricted payments or apply revenues earned in one part of our operations to fund development costs or operating losses in another part of our operations   ·enter into sale and leaseback transactions   ·engage in new businesses   ·issue preferred stock and   ·enter into transactions with shareholders and affiliates   in addition the covenants may include some of the following financial covenants including requirements that we satisfy certain tests or ratios such as maximum capital expenditures test a maximum leverage ratio minimum interest and debt service coverage ratios these covenants described herein may restrict our ability to operate and restrict our ability to incur additional debt or equity financing and impede our growth   risks related to this offering   there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or adss prior to this offering and you may not be able to resell our adss at or above the price you will have paid or at all   prior to this initial public offering there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or adss we have applied to have our adss listed on the nasdaq market our ordinary shares will not be listed or quoted for trading on any exchange if an active trading market for our adss does not develop after this offering the market price and liquidity of our adss will be materially and adversely affected   the initial public offering price for our adss will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriter and may bear no relationship to the market price for our adss after the initial public offering we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our adss will develop or that the market price of our adss will not decline below the initial public offering price   we will incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company which may adversely affect our profitability   our profitability may be affected as a result of our becoming a public company we anticipate incurring a significantly greater amount of legal accounting and other expenses than we did as a private company including costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and investor relations activities independent registered public accounting firm fees registrar and transfer agent fees incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market has required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs and to make certain corporate activities more timeconsuming and costly we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs which may adversely affect our profitability          if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud   upon completion of this initial public offering we will become a public company in the united states and subject to the sarbanesoxley act section  of the sarbanesoxley act “section ” will require that we include a report from management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form f beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending december   in addition our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls are not effective moreover even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us either of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our reporting processes which could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our adss   in addition our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources and systems in the foreseeable future prior to this offering we have been a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting we prepared financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” as of and for the two years ended december   and december   we may identify control deficiencies as a result of the assessment process we will undertake in compliance with section  we plan to remedy any identified control deficiencies before the deadline imposed by the requirements of section  but we may be unable to do so our failure to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting processes which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our adss   the market price for our adss may be volatile   the market price for our adss may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following   ·actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results ·changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts ·conditions and restrictions in the golf and lodging industries ·changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other lodging companies ·announcements by us or our competitors of new products acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments ·addition or departure of key

other transfer restrictions on our outstanding adss or ordinary shares or sales of additional adss and ·general economic conditions in taiwan and political tension between taiwan and china    in addition the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our adss          because the initial public offering price is substantially higher than our net tangible book value per share you will incur immediate and substantial dilution   the initial public offering price per ads is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per ads prior to the offering accordingly if you purchase our adss in this offering you will incur immediate dilution of approximately  in the net tangible book value per ads from the price you pay for our adss representing the difference between   ·the assumed initial public offering price of per ads the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus and   ·the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per ads of as of december     if we issue additional adss in the future you may experience further dilution in addition you may experience further dilution to the extent that ordinary shares are issued upon the exercise of the underwriter warrants you may find additional information in the section entitled “dilution” in this prospectus   we may need additional capital and the sale of additional adss or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our ads holders and the incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase our debt obligations   we can give no assurance that our current cash and cash equivalents anticipated cash flow from operations and the proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity and equitylinked securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all particularly in the aftermath of global economic crisis   future sales or issuances or perceived future sales or issuances of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or adss could adversely affect the price of our adss   if our existing shareholders sell or are perceived as intending to sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares or adss following this offering the market price of our adss could fall such sales or perceived potential sales by our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate the adss offered in this offering will be eligible for immediate resale in the public market without restrictions and shares held by our existing shareholders may also be sold in the public market in the future subject to the restrictions contained in rule  and rule  under the securities act and the applicable lockup agreements if any existing shareholder or shareholders sell a substantial amount of ordinary

individual basis holders of our adss will appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by the adss you may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote and it is possible that you or persons who hold their adss through brokers dealers or other third parties will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote   you may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result   we may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders including rights to acquire our securities under the deposit agreement for the adss the depositary will not offer those rights to ads holders unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ads holders are either registered under the securities act of  as amended or exempt from registration under the securities act with respect to all holders of adss we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective in addition we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions from registration under the securities act accordingly holders of our adss may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result          you may be subject to limitations on transfer of your adss   your adss are transferable on the books of the depositary however the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties in addition the depositary may refuse to deliver transfer or register transfers of adss generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or under any provision of the deposit agreement or for any other reason   as a foreign private issuer we are permitted to and we will rely on exemptions from certain nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to us issuers including the requirement regarding the implementation of a nominating committee this may afford less protection to holders of our ordinary shares and adss   the nasdaq marketplace rules in general require listed companies to have among other things a nominating committee consisting solely of independent directors as a foreign private issuer we are permitted to and we will follow home country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the nasdaq marketplace rules including among others the implementation of a nominating committee the corporate governance practice in our home country the british virgin islands does not require the implementation of a nominating committee we currently intend to rely upon the relevant home country exemption in lieu of the nominating committee as a result the level of independent oversight over management of our company may afford less protection to holders of our ordinary shares and adss   you may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited because we are incorporated under british virgin islands law conduct substantially all of our operations in taiwan and the majority of our officers reside outside the united states   we are incorporated in the british virgin islands and conduct substantially all of our operations in taiwan through our wholly owned subsidiaries in taiwan most of our officers reside outside the united states and some or all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult if not impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the british virgin islands or in taiwan in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind outside the british virgin islands or taiwan the laws of the british virgin islands and of taiwan may render you unable to effect service of process upon or to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce a nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits a judgment of a court of another jurisdiction may be reciprocally recognized or enforced if the jurisdiction has a treaty with taiwan or if judgments of the taiwanese courts have been recognized before in that jurisdiction subject to the satisfaction of other requirements for more information regarding the relevant laws of the british virgin islands and taiwan see “enforceability of civil liabilities”   our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the bvi business companies act as amended the “bvi act” and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and provides significantly less protection to investors moreover british virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the united states          as a result of all of the above our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states   our management will have considerable discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from this offering   our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds received by us you will not have

subsidiary through loans the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between the entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and its registered capital such loans must be registered with state administration of foreign exchange “safe” or its local branches which usually takes up to  working days to complete we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis if at all          dividend policy   our board of directors has discretion on whether to distribute dividends subject to certain restrictions under british virgin islands law namely that our company may only pay dividends out of profits and provided that immediately following payment of such dividend the value of the company’s assets would exceed its liabilities and our company is able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends the form frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings capital requirements and surplus general financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant   we do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares and adss in the foreseeable future after this offering we currently intend to retain most if not all of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business   we are a holding company incorporated in the british virgin islands we may rely on dividends from our subsidiaries in taiwan to provide liquidity including any payment of dividends to our shareholders taiwan regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us see

difference between the initial public offering price per ads and our net tangible book value per ads after this offering dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per

a combined basis as of june   was approximately us  million or us  per ordinary share as of that date and us  per ads net tangible book value represents the amount of our total combined tangible

         enforceability of civil liabilities   we are incorporated in the british virgin islands to take advantage of certain benefits associated with being a british virgin islands exempted company such as   •political and economic stability   •an effective judicial system   •a favorable tax system   •the absence of exchange controls or currency restrictions and   •the availability of professional and support services   however certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the british virgin islands these disadvantages include but are not limited to   •the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and these securities laws provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the united states and   •british virgin islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states   our constitutional documents do not contain provisions requiring that disputes including those arising under the securities laws of the united states between us our officers directors and shareholders be arbitrated   substantially all of our operations are conducted in taiwan and substantially all of our assets are located in taiwan a majority of our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and most of their assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the united states upon these individuals or to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the united states in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states   we have appointed maples corporate services bvi limited as our agent in the british virgin islands upon whom process may be served in any action brought against us under the securities laws of the united states          maples and calder our legal counsel as to british virgin islands law and sha hung law firm our legal counsel as to taiwanese law have advised us respectively that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the british virgin islands and taiwan respectively would   •recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states or   •certain original actions brought in each respective jurisdiction against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states   there is uncertainty with regard to british virgin islands law as to whether a judgment obtained from the united states courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the british virgin islands as penal or punitive in nature if such a determination is made the courts of the british virgin islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a british virgin islands company because the courts of the british virgin islands have yet to rule on whether such judgments are penal or punitive in nature it is uncertain whether they would be enforceable in the british virgin islands maples and calder has advised us that although there is no statutory enforcement in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the united states a judgment obtained in such jurisdiction will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the british virgin islands at common law without any reexamination of the merits of the underlying dispute by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the court of the british virgin islands provided such judgment   •is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction   •imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given   •is final and there was no fraud on the part of the person in whose favor judgment was given or on the part of the court   •is not in respect of taxes a fine or a penalty or similar fiscal revenue obligations and   •was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the british virgin islands   sha hung law firm has further advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the civil law of taiwan taiwan courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of section  of the civil procedure of taiwan and article  section  of the enforcement act of taiwan based either on treaties between taiwan and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions taiwan does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the united states or the british virgin islands that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in addition according to the section  of the civil procedure of taiwan law courts in taiwan will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of taiwan law or national sovereignty security or public interest as a result it is uncertain whether and on what basis a taiwan court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the united states or the british virgin islands under the civil law foreign shareholders may originate actions based on civil law against us in taiwan if they can establish sufficient nexus to taiwan for a taiwan court to have jurisdiction and meet other procedural requirements including among others the plaintiff must have a direct interest in the case and there must be a concrete claim a factual basis and a cause for the suit however it would be difficult for foreign shareholders to establish sufficient nexus to taiwan by virtue only of holding our adss or ordinary shares          corporate structure   we own  of the issued and outstanding

mainland china visitors to taiwan visitation to taiwan between  and  increased  during the sevenyear period jumping from approximately  million to approximately  million per year according to the data from the tourism bureau of motc visitors from china comprised  of the taiwan market we believe that visitation and tourism revenue growth for the taiwan market have been and will continue to be driven by a combination of factors including liberalization of restrictions on travel to taiwan from china ease of currency restrictions to permit chinese citizens to take larger sums of foreign currency out of china when they travel a growing middle class in asia with more disposable income and infrastructure improvements that are expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within taiwan the recent cease of talk between china and taiwan has contributed to the abrupt  decline of visitation from china to taiwan the change of relationship between china and taiwan is a crucial and

including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets impairment of long lived assets contingent assets and revenue recognition judgments are based on historical experience terms of existing contracts industry trends and information available from outside sources as appropriate however by their nature judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates   our significant accounting policies are detailed in “note  summary of significant accounting policies” in the company’s combined financial statements for the

currently own approximately  acres of land located in the miaoli county taiwan republic of china “roc” where we operate a golf course known as “the royal country club” which occupies approximately  acres of land the royal country club has a renovatedhole golf course golf shop snack bar and locker rooms the golf course is designed by robert t jones a world renowned golf architect   miaoli is approximately three times the size of singapore with approximate  inhabitants and is located in western taiwan which is approximately  miles south of taipei the capital of taiwan roc miaoli is contiguous with the hsinchu city to the north the taichung city to the south and borders the taiwan strait to the west known as the mountain town miaoli is a popular destination for hiking owing to a large number of mountains natural hot springs in miaoli and the aboriginal culture hakka attract tourists all year round   in addition to operating the golf course we aim to build the “royal country club spa  resort” a premier resort that will include two hotels as well as a collection of recreational activities the architecture and gardens in our resort will be designed and arranged to recreate a scene reflecting japan in the th century we believe that our officers’ and strategic partners’ managerial expertise in hospitality entertainment and construction and resources in resort and golf course development management marketing and financing in taiwan will be an integral part in fully executing our business plan   we have entered into a binding letter of intent with and made an initial payment of  to ihg pursuant to which ihg has agreed to manage the two hotels to be constructed on our site our current plans include changing the landscape of the golf course to include a floral garden with the end in view of making it one of the most scenic golf venues in taiwan for this purpose we have engaged cuningham as the designer for our entire resort in addition we are currently in preliminary discussion with various leading consulting companies regarding the management of various entertainment activities to be built in the resort at the present time we intend to engage bayshore pacific leisure ltd a wellestablished entertainment consulting company that focuses on activity and park design equipment supply and entertainment center management in china hong kong and taiwan   it is anticipated that upon the completion of this offering and assuming that the proceeds of at least  is received we will be able to complete the first phase of our current plan which consists of the construction of a premium hotel with an aggregate of two hundred and fifty  rooms or units a full service hot spring spa and affiliated hot spring therapy center several courtyard gardens pools in addition to the existing golf course upon raising another  of equity andor debt we anticipate that although we cannot guarantee we will be able to complete the second phase of our construction plan which contemplates the construction and development of a second luxurious hotel with an aggregate of one hundred and fifty  rooms or units another full service hot spring spa and affiliated hot spring therapy center three upscale restaurants serving chinese american and european dishes pools and water slides a large japanese garden hosting the golf course a multipurpose center for weddings and conferences and a shopping and entertainment village the resort contemplated by the management team comprise of these two phases of the construction the designs for this resort have been completed by cuningham   we anticipate completing the two initial phases according to the following timeline assuming we can raise    •complete phase i by the third or fourth quarter of  •complete phase ii before the third quarter of  •launch the resort with full function by the third quarter of    phase i will include construction of a hotel with full service hot spring spa facilities inside courtyard gardens and pools we plan to start the construction from the north side of the resort land in order that we can continue to operate the golf course which is located on the south side of the construction site phase ii will include construction and development of the second hotel which will feature a full service hot spring spa a multipurpose event center a shopping and dining village and other venues for recreational purposes           our target customer base includes golfers corporate executives business people and families upon completion of phase ii we will provide comprehensive recreational and business services all year round in the resort where our guests can enjoy various indoor and outdoor amenities we believe that upon the completion of the two phases of the royal country club spa  resort we will become more competitive in the taiwan resort and entertainment space we also believe upon completion of the two phases of the new construction our royal country club spa  resort will be one of the wellknown attractions in asia that will draw more tourists from around the world   hospitality and entertainment industries in taiwan   background   taiwan’s hospitality sector is thriving buoyed by the island’s transformation into what is deemed to be an upandcoming destination for asian travelers in november  the national geographic traveler a popular travel magazine in the united states published a page special report to introduce taiwan’s diverse sights and cultural features acclaiming that “taiwan is asia’s bestkept secret” after the taiwanese government eased some of the restrictions on chinese visitors in  the tourism in taiwan grew and the boom has been consistently changing the face of taiwan’s hospitality sector ever since from  to  the number of foreign tourists jumped from  million to  million per year reflecting a  increase for the sevenyear period particularly from  to  the number of international travelers increased by  according to the data from the tourism bureau of ministry of transportation and communications “motc” the statistics from the tourism bureau of motc revealed that the numbers of visitors from china japan south korea and malaysia all rose by doubledigits tourists from south korea form taiwan’s fastest growing foreign tourist market in  alone the number of south korean arrivals rose by  yearonyear to more than  moreover visitors from mainland china now comprise  of the taiwan tourist market since  the number of tourists from hong kong has more than doubled from  to  million in  the number of tourists from japan has also risen from less than  million in  to  million in  in  the tourism bureau of motc disclosed that the number of visitors coming to taiwan totaled  in  we anticipate that the development of this worldclass resort will attract not just foreign visitors but local taiwanese visitors as well   while taiwan’s leisure travel market is growing at a rapid pace the percentage of business travelers to taiwan decreased from onethird of all tourist arrivals in  to just one tenth in  according to the government data in  approximately  business travelers arrived in taiwan compared to  business travelers in  studies made by cbre research “cbre” attribute such a decline to the trend that a number of international companies are shifting their business operations to china   we believe that the development and launch of new luxury hotels would herald a turnaround for the business travel sector that had been stagnant for the first decade of the new millennium recently top global hospitality brands which ignored taiwan for years as they expanded their territories in mainland china and southeast asia are now considering taiwan as a viable location for new luxury hotels the overall hospitality business has become bullish in taiwan and investor appetite has appeared strong some of global hospitality companies are changing the landscape in taipei’s fivestar hotel segment which plays a critical role in attracting highend leisure travelers and business people as of  taipei had four internationally branded fivestar hotels the grand hyatt the shangrila’s far eastern plaza the westin and the regent which while locally owned had an international presence    edwin hsiao taiwan is “asias bestkept secret” acclaimed travel magazine states taiwan today nov   httpwwwtaiwantodaytwctasp xitemctnode  the tourism bureau motc republic of china taiwan httpadmintaiwannettwstatisticsyearenaspxno  id  id  id  id  id  id  id  id          after the chinese civil war in  the relations between china and taiwan were characterized by tensions and instability after the  presidential election in taiwan the relationship between mainland china and taiwan improved and thereafter the crossstrait business has grown rapidly ever since as a result the number of business travelers from china to taiwan has increased gradually which in turn benefited a number of fivestar hotels in taiwan as business travelers usually choose to stay in luxurious hotels   our market opportunity   we believe that our resort as envisioned will be able to surpass other recreational resorts and golf courses in taiwan including existing theme parks amusement parks resorts and hotels that are near places of interest   hospitality and recreational businesses are generally evaluated by the following criteria location occupancy rates reputation uniqueness perceived quality of the attractions and amenities such as golf courses spas and theme parks atmosphere and cleanliness of the attractions and amenities quality of the accommodations quality of food and beverages service levels and reservation systems   based on the criteria mentioned above we believe that we face minimal competition from local businesses due to the fact that there is currently no upscale hotel or resort in the miaoli county that is comparable to the resort we intend to build hotels or motels in miaoli are generally small for example the sunrise country club in taoyuan has only  rooms another medium sized hotel nearby has  rooms with few amenities other than the hot spring facilities in addition there is another hotel  miles away from our golf course which although managed by a reputable management team is located at least  minutes off of the zhongshan highway the rest of hotels and resorts in miaoli do not have any amenities other than golf courses and as such we believe they are not comparable to our resort that we intend to construct   location and transportation   we through yaoteh own and occupy a parcel of land of approximately  acres in miaoli taiwan where the royal country club is and the royal country club spa  resort will be located the property includes  lots in dataoping section zaoqiao township and laotianliao section touwu township yaoteh’s land is currently categorized as hill land which we are in the process of turning into a golf special district for entertainment purposes in addition to yaoteh’s hill land tatehfu owns another parcel of land of approximately  acres consisting of  lots in gongjing section miaoli tatehfu holds the land for real

country club the golf course   originally built and opened for business in  the golf course was renovated in  after the major renovation the golf course has continued its operation since  it is an hole tournament golf course designed by robert trent jones jr a world renowned golf course architect the fairways are not long but the undulating terrain and various obstacles make this venue very challenging professional golf players in taiwan consider the course moderately to highly challenging as on average golfers are forced to take eight to ten more strokes to finish a game there are approximately  rounds of golf played on average every year on this golf course the royal country club golf course is also recognized one of the most beautiful golf venues in taiwan to avoid loss of soil caused by severe weather conditions the golf course has adopted an underground drainage system of high quality japanese pipes which are about  kilometers  miles in length also the golf course is planted with tifdwarf a type of grass that grows very quickly and is popular among professional golf courses so far the golf course has not suffered any irreversible loss or damage due to severe weather or other controllable causes the golf course is currently in operation and opens to the public additionally golfers have the option to become members of the club which provide certain benefits including but not limited to reduced fees to play golf            our golf course has been at the testing operation stage for the past  years during the fiscal year ended december   and  we have generated revenue of approximately  and  respectively and after foreign currency adjustment comprehensive income of and loss of  respectively as for the six months ended june   and  the company and its subsidiaries have produced revenue of approximately  and  respectively and after foreign currency adjustment comprehensive loss of  and  respectively   the licenses and permits for the royal country club   yaoteh originally planned to build a hole golf course and obtained the establishment permit in  the development permit in  five miscellaneous construction licenses between  and  yaoteh completed the construction of the first eighteen holes of the hole golf course in  and thereafter received three miscellaneous operation licenses however due to land ownership disputes and certain land classification unsuitable for golfing purpose yaoteh was forced to abandon the plan of building a hole golf course and instead settled with the hole course which was completed at that time because the hole golf course does not comply with the description on the permits and licenses obtained for the hole golf course yaoteh needs to amend all the permits and licenses and thereafter reclassify the land as golf special district we currently operate the golf course on a testing basis upon finishing the land reclassification it will probably take us three months to receive the operation license for the hole golf course we have engaged mr yicheng huang to obtain all the necessary licenses and permits for the golf course in order to make the golf course run in its full capacity and with full functionality yicheng huang estimates that he will probably finish the entire application process and obtain the operation license for the royal country club in  for more

during phase i the golf course will remain in operation until the opening of the first hotel and hot spring spa after that during phase ii of the construction we may close the golf course periodically to facilitate the construction of the second hotel and affiliated amenities upon completion of phase ii the golf course will serve its golfing function for a few days in a week and as a garden for the rest of the week the resort will continue generating revenues throughout the two phases and thereafter from various sources including golfing lodging hot spring spa services shopping and admission

inside one of the existing ponds in our golf course upon which a wedding chapel will be constructed                nature reserves   the hot spring spas   we also plan to build a full service hot spring spa the “enchanted water fairy retreat spa” which will provide both indoor and outdoor facilities as well as massage rooms hot spring therapy pools body treatment and facial  skincare services the enchanted water fairy retreat spa will reflect the traditional japanese hot spring spa style which has been proven popular in asia therefore we expect a significant amount of revenue generated from the spa services   various minerals dissolved in hot springs have been credited with specific health benefits for example sulfur in hot springs is said to relieve nasal congestion and calcium and sodium bicarbonate are said to enhance circulations a report made in  by the geological survey team of china national petroleum corp stated that the underground hot springs in the royal country club spa and resort were rich in sulfur carbonic acid and other minerals according to this report the temperature of the hot springs ranged from °c to °c °f to °f and the average amount of spring water coming up to the ground was between  to  tons our resort plans to provide hot springs in winters cold springs in summers and hot and cold springs all year round to cater different needs for guests staying at our hotels they will have access to hot spring water in their rooms meanwhile nonstaying visitors will be able to use two huge outdoor spring water pools one isolated nude bath pool for each gender and fifteen private spring water pools for families guests may find the mirror pool ideal for meditation and the water rides perfect for adventures for small children and teenagers we hope our various water rides will be able to cater their needs and give them exciting and joyful experience that is beyond their imagination   the shopping and entertainment village       the design of the shopping and entertainment village site   the shopping and entertainment village will aim at mirroring a th century japanese village we plan to have an exceptional retail and dining area   which shall be linked with village–like streets and yards woven together in a sequence of unfolding architectural spaces allowing for our guests to enjoy the pleasant and relaxing environment for this village cuningham has specified the layout of seating water scenery and plants in order to blur the line between the commercial shops and the nature groups of bamboos and evergreens will contour the walkways inside the village on the bridge connecting the end of the main walkway and the hotel area visitors shall be able to take in the majestic view of the entire gardengolf course          our clients   we currently operate the royal country club which is a golf course that is open to members of the club and general public   once the contemplated construction is completed our targeted customers will comprise not only golfers but also corporate executives general business people and leisure travelers we believe that the new retail stores entertainment facilities gardens hotels conference center hot spring spas bars and restaurants will appeal to both business people and leisure visitors who want to enjoy the natural beauty moreover we will design several tour packages from which our visitors may choose to serve their different visiting purposes   seasonality   golf operations are seasonal in nature and our golf course is also subject to the seasonality in miaoli revenues generated from our golf club decline when temperatures are low and when days are short the rainy season in taiwan is may july august and september however the weather during the rest of a year is generally ideal for golf the average rainy days in taiwan are  days per year during which our golf operations decline generally extreme weather patterns such as droughts could also adversely affect a golf course’s operation because water may become unavailable or overly expensive for the purpose of maintaining the grass at a satisfactory level however there are currently five lakes inside the resort which serve as reservoirs to provide irrigation resources for the golf course   although the golf business can be cyclical and seasonal we anticipate that our tobeconstructed resort would to a limited extent be affected by weather conditions based on the occupancy rates of major hotels in taiwan people tend to stay at hotels and eat at restaurants in their hosting hotels during the summers and during major holidays major holidays in taiwan are founding day of the republic of china january st labor day may st dragon boat festival in june and national day october th we also give important consideration to major holidays in mainland china because visitors from mainland china constitute a large percentage of visitors to taiwan the important holidays in mainland china include chinese new year late january or early february labor day may st and national day october st each of which is referred to as the “golden tourism week” because workers usually have one week off for each holiday in addition with the well observed chinese new year during winters we do not expect a dramatic downturn of our hotel and retail business in the resort during such time   furthermore miaoli has what is known as the “strawberry season” and “spring blossoms” in april and historically the number of visitors to miaoli increases   because the resort’s nongolfing operations are not as prone to weather conditions compared to the golf club we anticipate that the new business operations would help increase our overall revenues winters and the rainy seasons are the slow seasons for the golf course but constitute peak seasons for tourism because of the chinese new year and summer vacations as a result we believe that the inclusion of the nongolf related operations such as the hotels and other amenities is an integral aspect of our growth   marketing   as described above we plan to grow a large amount of plants including trees bushes and flowers of various kinds in the golf course to make it one of the most beautiful golf venues in taiwan as part of the marketing efforts for the contemplated resort the scenic golf course inside the resort will be highlighted on different platforms and through various channels such as social media highend leisure publications and visits by travel agencies additionally we intend to host international golf tournaments on our golf properties and advertise them through all sorts of channels such as social media radio television magazines and appropriate billboards   we intend to initiate and maintain an extensive marketing campaign that will maximize our resort’s visibility in our targeted markets our sales and marketing strategy will primarily consist of hosting press conferences and inviting media personnel to visit our resort during the construction phases as well as upon completion thereof            our marketing objectives include but are not limited to   •enhancing brand awareness utilizing the ihg’s portfolio plus our current establishment to generate a strong brand   •building a stronger sales network establishing relationships with both domestic and international travel agencies   •promoting corporate image with a broadbased public relations firm targeted towards high end travel publications   in addition pursuant to the letter of intent with ihg both of the hotels to be constructed will be marketed by ihg in a manner that is consistent with their current marketing efforts for other hotels which they operate   employees   as of date when this statement is made we have eightyfive  employees all located in

that there is any pending lawsuit or legal proceeding brought by or against us or threatened   however due to certain land use regulations in taiwan yaoteh was a party in a real estate lawsuit the land use regulations in taiwan prescribed that only individuals could be lawful owners of farmland it was unclear whether the land upon which the royal country club had been planned to be built was farmland or nonfarmland when yaoteh purchased the real property as a solution to this uncertainty yaoteh asked a few individual yeomen at that time to be record owners of the above described land on behalf of yaoteh which actually paid the full purchase price after the real property was classified as nonfarmland all but one individual yeomen returned their titles to the real property respectively without any difficulty that individual yeoman mr langsheng lin insisted on getting compensation in exchange for the transfer of the title of the real property he was holding for yaoteh on november   yaoteh filed a complaint against langsheng lin the “defendant” at taiwan miaoli district court in taiwan for not transferring the title of land that was purchased by yaoteh pursuant to the trust registration agreement entered by yaoteh and the defendant on february   the court found that yaoteh’s evidence did not sustain its claim during the appeal on september   yaoteh and the defendant settled the case pursuant to the settlement yaoteh agreed to pay approximately  to the defendant who in return agreed to transfer the title of land back to yaoteh after receiving the full payment as of december   yaoteh has paid approximately  to the defendant for more details please refer to exhibit  the legal opinion on land dispute issued from sha hung law firm our counsel in taiwan   research

relevant to specific us investors in light of their particular circumstances or to us investors subject to special treatment under us federal income tax law such as banks or other financial institutions insurance companies taxexempt organizations retirement plans partnerships regulated investment companies dealers in stock securities or currencies brokers real estate investment trusts certain former citizens or residents of the united states persons who acquire adss or ordinary shares as part of a straddle hedge conversion transaction or other integrated investment persons that have a “functional currency” other than the us dollar persons that own directly indirectly or constructively  or more of our company’s shares persons that are resident in or hold adss or ordinary shares in connection with a permanent establishment outside the united states or persons that generally mark their securities to market for us federal income tax purposes          as used in this summary the term “us investor” means a beneficial owner of adss or ordinary shares that is for us federal income tax purposes i an individual citizen or resident of the united states ii a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source or iv a trust a if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more “us persons” within the meaning of the code have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or b if a valid election is in effect for the trust to be treated as a us person   if an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds the adss or ordinary shares the tax treatment of such partnership and each partner thereof will generally depend upon the status and activities of the partnership and such partner a holder that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes should consult its own tax adviser regarding the us federal income tax considerations applicable to it and its partners of the purchase ownership and disposition of the adss or ordinary shares   prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the particular tax considerations applicable to them relating to the purchase ownership and disposition of adss or ordinary shares including the applicability of us federal state and local tax laws and nonus tax laws   •taxation of dividends   subject to the passive foreign investment company “pfic” discussed below a us investor will be required to include in gross income the gross amount of any distribution paid on the adss or ordinary shares including any amount of taxes withheld by our company out of our company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes distributions in excess of our company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the us investor’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares and adss and thereafter will be treated as a gain from the sale of the ordinary shares and adss consequently a us investor should treat the entire amount of any distribution received as a dividend   in case of a us investor that is a corporation dividends paid on the adss or ordinary shares will be subject to regular corporate rates and will not be eligible for the “dividends received” deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends received from us corporations subject to the discussion below dividends paid on the adss or ordinary shares to individuals and certain other noncorporate persons will generally be subject to tax at ordinary income rates   certain dividends received by noncorporate us investors including individuals in taxable years beginning before january   generally will be subject to a maximum income tax rate of  this reduced income tax rate is applicable to dividends paid by “qualified foreign corporations” and only if certain holding period requirements and other conditions are met a nonus corporation other than a corporation that is classified as a pfic for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation i if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the us and which includes an exchange of information program or ii with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the us unless legislation is enacted extending the favorable tax treatment of dividends dividends received by noncorporate us investors in taxable years beginning after december   will generally be subject to tax at ordinary income rates   a us investor may be eligible subject to a number of complex limitations to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on the adss or ordinary shares a us investor who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax withheld may instead claim a deduction for us federal income tax purposes in respect of such withholding but only for a year in which such investor elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation dividends paid by our company will depending on the circumstances of the us investor be either general or passive income          •taxation of sale exchange or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares   subject to the pfic discussion below a us investor generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale exchange or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference if any between the amount realized on the sale exchange or other disposition and the us investor’s adjusted tax basis in such adss or ordinary shares this capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us investor’s holding period in the adss or ordinary shares exceeds one year longterm capital gain of a noncorporate us investor is generally taxed at preferential rates the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations the gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the united states for us foreign tax credit purposes us investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on the disposition of adss or ordinary shares including the availability of the foreign tax credit under an investor’s own particular circumstances   a us investor that receives nonus currency on the disposition of the adss or ordinary shares will realize an amount equal to the us dollar value of the foreign currency received on the date of disposition or in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis taxpayers the settlement date whether or not converted into us dollars at that time very generally the us investor will recognize currency gain or loss if the us dollar value of the currency received on the settlement date differs from the amount realized with respect to the adss or ordinary shares any currency gain or loss on the settlement date or on any subsequent disposition of the foreign currency generally will be us source ordinary income or loss   •passive foreign investment company   in general a foreign corporation will be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which either i at least  of its gross income is “passive income” or ii at least  of the average value of its total assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income passive income for this purpose generally includes among other things dividends interest certain royalties rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income in determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic a proportionate share of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns directly or indirectly at least a  interest by value is taken into account   we do not expect to be a pfic for the current taxable year or any future year the pfic determination however depends upon the application of complex us federal income tax rules concerning the classification of our assets and income for this purpose and the application of these rules is uncertain in some respects under the income and asset tests whether our company is a pfic will be determined annually based upon the composition and nature of our income and the composition nature and valuation of our assets all of which are subject to change for purposes of the asset test any cash including proceeds from the public offering will generally be treated as a passive asset and the amount of cash held by our company in any year will depend in part on when our company spends the cash raised from the public offering and generated in its operations in addition the determination of our company’s pfic status will depend upon the nature of the assets acquired by our company moreover the determination of the value of our company’s assets may depend on its market capitalization and that market capitalization may fluctuate accordingly there can be no assurance that we will not be a pfic in the current or any future year in addition there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determination by our company that it does not constitute a pfic          if our company was classified as a pfic for any taxable year during which a us investor held adss or ordinary shares the us investor absent certain elections including a marktomarket election would generally be subject to adverse rules regardless of whether our company continues to be classified as a pfic with respect to i any “excess distributions” generally any distributions received by the us investor on the adss or ordinary shares in a taxable year that were greater than  percent of the average annual distributions received by the us investor in the three preceding taxable years or if shorter the us investor’s holding period for the adss or ordinary shares and ii any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of adss or ordinary shares   under these adverse rules a the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the us investor’s holding period b the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which our company was classified as a pfic will be taxed as ordinary income and c the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years during which our company was classified as a pfic would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayers for that year and an interest charge would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such taxable year   if our company was a pfic for any taxable year during which a us investor held the adss or ordinary shares our company would continue to be treated as a pfic with respect to that us investor for all succeeding years during which the us investor held the adss or ordinary shares the us investor may terminate this deemed pfic status by electing to recognize gains which would be taxed under the special tax rules discussed above as if the us investor’s adss or ordinary shares had been sold on the last day of the last taxable year for which our company was a pfic if our company holds or acquires an interest in an entity which is itself a pfic such an interest may be treated as owned by a us investor us investors should consult their own tax advisers regarding the consequences to them if our company holds or acquires an interest in an entity which is itself a pfic   although the pfic rules permit a us holder of stock in a pfic in certain circumstances to avoid some of the disadvantageous tax treatment described above by making a “qualified electing fund” or qef election a us investor will not be able to elect to treat our company as a qef because our company does not intend to prepare the information that the us investor would need to make a qef election   if our company was a pfic in any year with respect to a us investor the disadvantageous tax treatment described above may in part be avoided with respect to our company if a us investor validly made a marktomarket election as of the beginning of such us investor’s holding period if such election was made such us investor generally would be required to take into account the difference if any between the fair market value of and its adjusted tax basis in the adss or ordinary shares at the end of each taxable year as ordinary income or to the extent of any net marktomarket gains previously included in income ordinary loss and to make corresponding adjustments to the tax basis of such adss or ordinary shares in addition any gain from a sale exchange or other disposition of the adss or ordinary shares would be treated as ordinary income and any loss would be treated as ordinary losses to the extent of any net marktomarket gains previously included in income a marktomarket election is available to a us investor only if the adss or ordinary shares are considered “marketable stock” generally shares will be considered marketable stock if the shares are “regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations   if our company was a pfic in any year with respect to a us investor the us investor would be required to file an annual return on irs form  regarding distributions received on the adss or ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of the adss or ordinary shares in addition under recently enacted us legislation and subject to future guidance if we were a pfic us investors would be required to file for taxable years beginning after march   an annual information return with the irs relating to their ownership of the adss or ordinary shares although expected no guidance has yet been issued about such return including on the information required to be reported on such return the form of the return or the due date for the return          us investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the pfic regime including eligibility for and the manner and advisability of making a marktomarket election   •certain reporting requirements   certain us investors are required to file information returns with the irs including irs form  return by us transferor of property to a foreign corporation reporting transfers of cash or other property to our company and information relating to the us investor and our company substantial penalties may be imposed upon a us investor that fails to comply   subject to specified exceptions and future guidance recently enacted us tax legislation generally requires a us investor that is an individual or to the extent provided in future guidance a us entity to report to the irs such us investor’s interests in stock or securities issued by a nonus person such as the company for taxable years beginning after march   although expected no guidance on this reporting requirement has yet been issued us investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the information reporting obligations that may arise from their acquisition ownership or disposition of adss or ordinary shares   •backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements   under certain circumstances us backup withholding tax andor information reporting may apply to us investors with respect to dividend payments made on or the payment of proceeds from the sale exchange or other disposition of the adss or ordinary shares unless an applicable exemption is satisfied us investors that are corporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a us investor’s us federal income tax liability if any or will be refunded if such us investor timely furnishes required information to the irs          republic of china taxation   this

december   and  respectively the accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern this basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the company’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business this presentation presumes funds will be available to finance ongoing research and development operations and capital expenditures and permit the realization of assets and the payment of liabilities in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future   there can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to the company and the combined financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plans to obtain such resources for the company include  obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities  shortterm and longterm borrowings from banks and  shortterm borrowings from stockholders or other related partyies when needed however management cannot provide any assurance that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations   note  summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation — the accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the financial statements include the combined accounts of yaoteh and tatehfu these companies are under common control and ownership all significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated    f      the functional currency of yaoteh and tatehfu is the new taiwan dollars however the accompanying combined financial statements have been translated and presented in united states dollars  in the accompanying combined financial statements and notes “” “us” and “us dollars” mean united states dollars and “nt” and “nt dollars” mean new taiwan dollars   segment reporting — the company follows the provisions of asc  formerly referred to as sfas no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments which uses a “management” approach for determining segments the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company’s reportable segments asc topic  “segment reporting” also requires disclosures about products or services geographic areas and major customers the company’s management reporting structure provided for only one segment in  and  and accordingly no separate segment information is presented   accounting estimates — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents — the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents   accounts receivable and other receivable — accounts receivable and other receivables are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables an allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful such receivable becomes doubtful when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy or financial reorganization and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired the amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income as are subsequent recoveries of previous impairments   property and equipment — property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred expenditures that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized when property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of the related gain or loss is included in operating income leasehold improvements are depreciated on the straightline method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset depreciation is calculated on the straightline method including property and equipment under capital leases generally based on the following useful lives      estimated life in years  land improvements     buildings and building improvements     machinery and equipment     office equipment        f      impairment of longlived assets — the company has adopted accounting standards codification subtopic  property plant and equipment “asc ” asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell management has determined that no impairments of longlived assets currently exist   land held for sale and investment — the company recorded the land held for sale and investment at the original land acquisition costs   fair value measurements — fasb asc  “fair value measurements” formerly sfas no  defines fair value for certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price it establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value this hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows   ·level  – inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available   ·level  – inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   ·level  – valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data the fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability    f      this guidance applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements on february   the fasb finalized fasb staff position fsp no  effective date of fasb   statement no  asc  this staff position delays the effective date of sfas no  asc  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the adoption of sfas no  asc  had no effect on the companys financial position or results of operations for the year  and    we also analyze all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under asc  formerly sfas  “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” and asc  formerly eitf  “accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock” we have determined asc  formerly sfas  and asc  formerly eitf  had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year  and    revenue recognition — the following describes the composition of revenues for the company   ·greens fee is charged to play on the golf course from members and nonmembers the revenues are recognized when the services are rendered   ·revenue from nonrefundable membership initiation fees is recognized over the estimated life of the facilities on a straightline basis upon inception of the club as of december   and  the weighted average remaining period over which nonrefundable membership initiation fees will be recognized is approximately  years and  years respectively see note    advertising costs — advertising costs are expensed at the time such advertising commences advertising expense for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively   income taxes — income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized there were no significant deferred tax items as of december   and    the company applied the provisions of asc  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the company’s liability for income taxes any such adjustment could be material to the company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based in part upon the results of operations for the given period at december   and  management considered that the company had no uncertain tax positions and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future    f      concentration of credit risk—the company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash the company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions but these investments may be in excess of taiwan central deposit insurance corporation’s insurance limits the company does not enter into financial instruments for hedging trading or speculative purposes concentration of credit risk with respect to trade   and notes receivables is limited due to the wide

assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   foreigncurrency transactions — foreigncurrency transactions are recorded in new taiwan dollars “nt” at the rates of exchange in effect when the transactions occur gains or losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when cash in foreign currency is converted into new taiwan dollars or when foreigncurrency receivables or payables are settled are credited or charged to income in the year of conversion or settlement on the balance sheet dates the balances of foreigncurrency assets and liabilities are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under stockholders’ deficit   statement of cash flows—cash flows from the companys operations are based upon the local currencies as a result amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet   translation adjustment — the accounts of the company was maintained and its financial statements were expressed

permit the realization of assets and the payment of liabilities in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future   there can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to the company and the unaudited combined financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plans to obtain such resources for the company include  obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities  shortterm and longterm borrowings from banks and  shortterm borrowings from stockholders or other related partyies when needed however management cannot provide any assurance that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability

standards for reporting information about operating segments which uses a “management” approach for determining segments the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company’s reportable segments asc topic  “segment reporting” also requires disclosures about products or services geographic areas and major customers the company’s management reporting structure provided for only one segment for the six months ended june   and  and accordingly no separate segment information is presented   accounting estimates — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents — the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents   accounts receivable and other receivable — accounts receivable and other receivables are stated at carrying value less estimates made for doubtful receivables an allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful such receivable becomes doubtful when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter into bankruptcy or financial reorganization and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired the amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income as are subsequent recoveries of previous impairments   property and equipment — property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred expenditures that improve the functionality of the related asset or extend the useful life are capitalized when property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of the related gain or loss is included in operating income leasehold improvements are depreciated on the straightline method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or estimated useful life of the asset depreciation is calculated on the straightline method including property and equipment under capital leases generally based on the following useful lives    f         estimated life in years  land improvements     buildings and building improvements     machinery and equipment     office equipment       impairment of longlived assets — the company has adopted accounting standards codification subtopic  property plant and equipment “asc ” asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell management has determined that no impairments of longlived assets currently exist   land held for sale and investment — the company recorded the land held for sale and investment at the original land acquisition costs   fair value measurements — fasb asc  “fair value measurements” formerly sfas no  defines fair value for certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price it establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value this hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows   ·level  – inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available   ·level  – inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities    f      ·level  – valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data the fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability   this guidance applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements on february   the fasb finalized fasb staff position fsp no  effective date of fasb statement no  asc  this staff position delays the effective date of sfas no  asc  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the adoption of sfas no  asc  had no

liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized there were no significant deferred tax items as of june   and december      f      the company applied the provisions of asc  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which provides clarification related to the process associated with

uncertain tax positions and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future   concentration of credit risk — the company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash the company places its cash and temporary cash investments in high quality credit institutions but these investments may be in excess of taiwan central deposit insurance corporation’s insurance limits the company does not enter into financial instruments for hedging trading or speculative purposes concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and notes receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the company transacts business as well as their dispersion across many geographical areas the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral but does require advance deposits on certain transactions   use of

when foreigncurrency receivables or payables are settled are credited or charged to income in the year of conversion or settlement on the balance sheet dates the balances of foreigncurrency assets and liabilities are restated at the prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current income except for those foreign currencies denominated investments in shares of stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under stockholders’ deficit   statement of cash flows — cash flows from the companys operations are based upon the local currencies as a result amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet

should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with subtopic  presentation of financial statements—liquidation basis of accounting even when an entitys liquidation is not imminent there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern in those situations financial statements should continue to be prepared

this accounting standards update are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company will
