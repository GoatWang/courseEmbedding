encouraged to consult with your counsel in determining whether all required conditions have been satisfied eligibility for purchase by money market funds certain investment considerations ratings the class a notes will be structured to be eligible securities for purchase by money market funds under rule a under the investment company act of  as amended rule a includes additional criteria for investments by money market funds including requirements and classifications relating to portfolio credit risk analysis maturity liquidity and risk diversification some of which have recently been amended money market funds contemplating a purchase of the class a notes are encouraged to consult their counsel before making a purchase the issuing entity is not registered or required to be registered as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended in determining that the issuing entity is not required to be registered as an investment company the issuing entity is relying on the exemption or exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in section c of the investment company act of  as amended or rule a under the investment company act of  as amended although other exceptions or exclusions may be available to the issuing entity the issuing entity is not a covered fund as defined in the final regulations issued december   implementing the volcker rule section  of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sponsor expects that the notes will receive credit ratings from two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations hired by the sponsor to assign ratings on the notes the hired rating agencies  the ratings of the notes will address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest on the notes according to their terms although the hired rating agencies are not contractually obligated to do so we believe that each hired rating agency rating the notes will monitor the ratings using its normal surveillance procedures any hired rating agency may change or withdraw an assigned rating at any time in addition a rating agency not hired by the sponsor to rate the transaction may provide an unsolicited rating that differs from or is lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies any rating action taken by one rating agency may not necessarily be taken by the other rating agency no transaction party will be responsible for monitoring any changes to the ratings on the notes see risk factors a reduction withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes in this prospectus supplement s risk factors you should consider the following risk factors and the factors set forth under risk factors in the accompanying prospectus in deciding whether to purchase the notes of any class payment priorities increase risk of loss or delay in payment to certain notes based on the priorities described under the notes payments of interest and the notes payments of principal in this prospectus supplement classes of notes that receive principal payments before other classes will be repaid more rapidly than the other classes in addition because principal of each class of notes will be paid sequentially so long as no event of default has occurred classes of notes that have higher ie  being higher than  sequential numerical class designations will be outstanding longer and therefore will be exposed to the risk of losses on the receivables during periods after other classes have been receiving most or all amounts payable on their notes and after which a disproportionate amount of credit enhancement may have been applied and not replenished because of the priority of payment on the notes the yields of the class a notes the class a notes and the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes accordingly the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes and the class a notes and the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes the class a notes and the class a notes if the actual rate and amount of losses exceed your expectations and if amounts in the reserve account are insufficient to cover the resulting shortfalls the yield to maturity on your notes may be lower than anticipated and you could suffer a loss classes of notes that receive payments earlier than expected are exposed to greater reinvestment risk and classes of notes that receive principal later than expected are exposed to greater risk of loss in either case the yields on your notes could be materially and adversely affected credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the motor vehicle loans information regarding credit scores for the motor vehicle loans obtained at the time of origination of the related receivables is presented in the receivables characteristics of the receivables general in this prospectus supplement a credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a borrower represents to a lender ie that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score neither the depositor the sponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any obligor s current credit score or the actual performance of any receivable or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a receivable will be paid in accordance with its terms s additionally historical loss and delinquency information set forth in this prospectus supplement under the receivables was affected by several variables including general economic conditions and market interest rates that are likely to differ in the future therefore there can be no assurance that the net loss experience calculated and presented in this prospectus supplement with respect to nissan motor acceptance corporation s managed portfolio of contracts will reflect actual experience with respect to the receivables in the receivables pool there can be no assurance that the future delinquency or loss experience of the servicer with respect to the receivables will be better or worse than that set forth in this prospectus supplement with respect to nissan motor acceptance corporation s managed portfolio varying economic circumstances may adversely affect the performance of the motor vehicle loans which could result in losses on the notes periods of continuing economic slowdown may adversely affect the performance and market value of your notes high unemployment or reduced availability of credit may lead to increased default rates these periods may also be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding automobile loan contracts which could weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales if an economic downturn continues for a prolonged period of time delinquencies and losses with respect to automobile loans generally could increase in addition higher future energy and fuel prices could reduce the amount of disposable income that consumers have available to make monthly payments on their automobile loan contracts higher energy costs could cause business disruptions which could cause unemployment and a further or deepening economic downturn such obligors could potentially become delinquent in making monthly payments or default if they are unable to make payments due to increased energy or fuel bills or unemployment the issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if the related obligors are unable to make timely payments see prepayments delinquencies repossessions and net credit losses delinquency repossession and credit loss information and static pool information in this prospectus supplement for delinquency and loss information regarding certain automobile loans originated and serviced by nissan motor acceptance corporation natural or manmade disasters may adversely affect the performance of the receivables extreme weather conditions or natural or manmade disasters and their immediate consequences could cause substantial business disruptions economic losses unemployment and an economic downturn when any of these events occur the obligor s ability or willingness to make payments on the receivables the value of used vehicles or the servicer s ability to administer the receivables could be adversely affected and accordingly the issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected s geographic concentration of the states of billing addresses of the obligors may increase the risk of loss on your investment as of the statistical cutoff date nissan motor acceptance corporation s records indicate that the billing addresses of the obligors of the receivables were most highly concentrated in the following states percentage of aggregate statistical cutoff date principal balance texas  california  florida  no other state based on the billing addresses of the obligors accounted for more than  of the total principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cutoff date economic conditions or other factors affecting these states in particular could adversely affect the delinquency credit loss repossession or prepayment experience of the issuing entity this prospectus supplement provides information regarding the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date that may differ from the characteristics of the receivables as of the cutoff date sold to the issuing entity on the closing date prepaid simple interest contracts may affect the weighted average life of the notes this prospectus supplement describes the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date may have characteristics that differ somewhat from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool described in this prospectus supplement we do not expect the characteristics as of the cutoff date of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date to differ materially from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date described in this prospectus supplement and each receivable sold to the issuing entity on the closing date must satisfy the eligibility criteria specified in the transaction documents if you purchase a note you must not assume that the characteristics of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will be identical to the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool disclosed in this prospectus supplement if an obligor on a simple interest contract makes a payment on the contract ahead of schedule the weighted average life of the notes could be affected this is because the additional payment will be treated as a principal prepayment and applied to reduce the principal balance of the related contract and the obligor will generally not be required to make any scheduled payments during the period for which it has paid ahead during this prepaid period interest will continue to accrue on the principal balance of the contract as reduced by the application of the additional payment but the obligor s contract would not be considered delinquent while the servicer may be required to make interest advances during this period no principal advances will be made furthermore when the obligor resumes his required payments the payments so paid may be insufficient to cover the interest that has accrued since the last payment by the obligor this situation will continue until the regularly scheduled payments are once again sufficient to cover all accrued interest and to reduce the principal balance of the contract s the weighted average life of the notes will generally be shortened if the issuing entity applies principal prepayments on the receivables to the outstanding principal balance of the notes however depending on the length of time during which a prepaid simple interest contract is not amortizing as described above the weighted average life of the notes may be extended in addition to the extent the servicer makes advances on a prepaid simple interest contract that subsequently goes into default the loss on this contract may be larger than would have been the case had advances not been made because liquidation proceeds for the contract will be applied first to reimburse the servicer for its advances nissan motor acceptance corporation s portfolio of retail installment contracts has historically included simple interest contracts that have been paid ahead by one or more scheduled monthly payments there can be no assurance as to the number of contracts in the issuing entity that may become prepaid simple interest contracts as described above or the number or the principal amount of the scheduled payments that may be paid ahead risk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure you may suffer losses due to receivables with low annual percentage rates because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the principal balance of the receivables the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential replacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the receivables has been repaid due to the reduction in the servicing fee as described in the foregoing it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer consequently the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under those circumstances may result in delays andor reductions in the interest and principal payments on your notes the receivables transferred to the issuing entity on the closing date may include receivables that have annual percentage rates that are less than the interest rates on the notes if that is the case interest paid on the higher coupon receivables and collections related to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will compensate for the lower coupon receivables excessive prepayments on the higher coupon receivables may adversely impact your notes by reducing the amount of interest available in the future to make payments on your notes s a reduction withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes the ratings on the notes are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell the notes and do not address market value or investor suitability the ratings reflect the rating agency s assessment of the creditworthiness of the receivables the credit enhancement on the notes and the likelihood of repayment of the notes there can be no assurance that the receivables andor the notes will perform as expected or that the ratings will not be reduced withdrawn or qualified in the future as a result of a change of circumstances deterioration in the performance of the receivables errors in analysis or otherwise none of the depositor the sponsor or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit enhancement or to take any other action to maintain any ratings on the notes if the ratings on your notes are reduced withdrawn or qualified it could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes the sponsor has hired two rating agencies and will pay them a fee to assign ratings on the notes the sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization or nrsro to assign ratings on the notes and is not aware that any other nrsro has assigned ratings on the notes however under sec rules information provided to a hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes is required to be made available to each nrsro in order to make it possible for such nonhired nrsros to assign unsolicited ratings on the notes an unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time including prior to the closing date and none of the depositor the sponsor the underwriters or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings assigned after the date of this prospectus supplement nrsros including the hired rating agencies have different methodologies criteria models and requirements if any nonhired nrsro assigns an unsolicited rating on the notes there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes in addition if the sponsor fails to make available to the nonhired nrsros any information provided to any hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes a hired rating agency could withdraw its ratings on the notes which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes potential investors in the notes are urged to make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the receivables and the credit enhancement on the notes and not to rely solely on the ratings on the notes s potential rating agency conflict of interest and regulatory scrutiny federal financial regulatory reform could have a significant impact on the servicer the sponsor the depositor or the issuing entity and could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments on your notes the sponsor has hired two nrsros to provide their ratings on the notes we note that a rating agency may have a conflict of interest where as is the case with the ratings of the notes by the hired rating agencies the sponsor or the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the rating agency for its rating services furthermore rating agencies including the hired rating agencies have been and may continue to be under scrutiny by federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies for their roles in the recent financial crisis and such scrutiny and any actions such legislative and regulatory bodies may take as a result thereof may also have an adverse effect on the market value of the notes and your ability to resell your notes on july   president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act  although the doddfrank act itself became effective on july   many of its provisions had delayed implementation dates or required implementing regulations to be issued some of these implementing regulations still
