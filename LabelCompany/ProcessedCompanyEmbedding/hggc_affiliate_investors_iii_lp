nutra admin  nutraceutical announces acquisition additional information about prop  may  in notices by nutraceuticalproposition  many california residents are familiar with a law known as proposition  also known as the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of  or prop  this law mandates that warnings be given to consumers in various circumstances california residents see these warnings nearly everywhere — at gas stations in parking garages in hotel lobbies and on various consumer products the original concept of prop  was to keep chemicals out of drinking water and to warn consumers before they are exposed to chemicals that may cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm the california office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha is responsible for publishing this list of chemicals and establishing the exposure levels that require warning statements there are over  chemicals on the prop  list for example under prop  an exposure to an amount of lead over  micrograms per day requires a cancer warning while an exposure to an amount of lead over  micrograms per day would require a reproductive toxicity warning the level requiring a reproductive toxicity warning is set at a level  times less than the level of exposure where there is no observable effect of harm a level which is far lower than that set by the epa or any federal agency the vast majority of prop  cases involving dietary supplements concern allegations of lead exposure warning statements when a warning statement is required on a consumer product including a dietary supplement it usually reads as follows for a carcinogen warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer for a reproductive toxin warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm enforcement of prop  violations of prop  are enforced by the california attorney general district attorneys or by private party “bounty hunters” who are authorized to recover and keep part of the civil penalties recovered through a trial or settlement as a result of the financial incentive offered to private parties to pursue these cases lawyers and law firms have become “bounty hunters” and devoted their practices to pursuing settlements and recoveries in a prop  case the only allegation is that the company failed to provide a warning – there is no claim that anyone has been harmed by the product at issue there have been numerous prop  cases and settlements involving dietary supplements most prop  cases settle prior to trial because the company bears the burden of proof to establish that a warning is not required on its products in  settlements with private party “bounty hunters” totaled over  million dollars – of which over  million was paid to the lawyers for the “bounty hunters” problems with prop  there have been several critiques leveled against prop  here are a few prop  unfairly impacts natural products products with synthetic ingredients or which are heavily processed can more easily avoid introducing or remove natural contaminants this unfairly impacts natural products according to the alliance for natural health a grassroots consumer group that seeks to promote health freedom in the united states “some prop  chemicals are prevalent in the natural environment and they unavoidably end up in supplements that contain natural ingredients while there are certain allowable “safe harbor” levels for prop  chemicals in a product these levels are often either extremely low or must be established through complicated and expensive lab testing at the expense of the supplement company prop  does provide an exemption for “naturally occurring” chemicals – but it is up to the supplement company to prove that this is the case which is both very difficult and expensive in the end supplement companies have the unfortunate choice of providing a prominent warning on what might in actuality be very safe supplement or not provide warning at all and risk noncompliance with prop ” a guide to california’s proposition   the prop  bounty hunter system is broken an article by jim conran former director of the california department of consumer affairs claims that it’s time to tame prop  bounty hunters pointing out that what started out as an environmental protection law has turned into a system that mainly seems to enrich private lawyers a march  law journal article entitled bounty hunters and the public interest – a study of proposition  reviews prop  actions and settlements and argues that the law has been abused by private bounty hunters and the california attorney general should more actively oversee enforcement of the law prop  hurts small businesses the group citizens against lawsuit abuse believes prop  enforcement actions are an abusive practice hurting small businesses nutraceutical’s compliance program nutraceutical has an active prop  compliance program which includes the following elements brochures nutraceutical has distributed to its california retailers brochures that include information about prop  for consumers including a warning the latest version of that brochure is available at wwwnutraceuticalcomnotices posters nutraceutical has distributed posters to all its retail consumers in california like the brochures these posters

nutraceuticalthere has been a significant amount of media attention paid recently to bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or “mad cow disease” concerns have been raised about various food products in the marketplace including dietary supplements and their potential connection to a variant of creutzfeldtjakob disease vcjd that appears to be caused by bse no one knows for sure how bse first emerged but it does appear that certain th century farming practices have helped to spread it news reports indicate that the united states department of agriculture usda and the food and drug administration fda are attempting to keep bse out of the united states even though there is currently no reliable test to detect bse in a live animal to date we are aware of only one reported case of bse in the united states various experts have expressed their view that the united states has enough safeguards in place to prevent a widespread outbreak as a leading manufacturer of dietary supplements nutraceutical corporation nutraceutical endeavors to assure that ingredients used in its products are of the highest quality and are carefully selected as part of this commitment nutraceutical has instituted measures to ensure that it purchases bovine material only from suppliers that provide written certifications of their procedures regarding bse while the specific procedures vary by ingredient and supplier examples of some of the procedures that have been instituted by such suppliers include where possible limiting the purchase of bovine material from countries where bse has either not been detected or where enforcement and surveillance programs are well developed and enforced process and control systems in sourcing and packaging compliance with government surveillance programs and compliance with other applicable regulations and guidelines including those of the fda the european commission and other governing bodies we believe that one of the most important steps that can be taken is for the fda the usda and other us government agencies to commit the funds to research bse and develop the testing methodology to allow all of us to ensure that the us food supply remains bse free we urge our customers to write their congressmen to encourage the government to continue to give the highest priority to this matter the information contained in this statement is

questions about kava kava piper methesticum september  in notices by nutraceuticalhistorical uses of kava kava kava – also known simply as kava – originated in the islands of the south pacific where it has been used for centuries as a ceremonial and communal drink a member of the black pepper family kava’s active properties appear to stem from the kavalactones found in its roots which are dried and pounded into a powder and then mixed into a beverage more recently kava has become popular as a dietary supplement either in capsule form often using extracts from the roots or as a beverage kava is best known for promoting relaxation recent government actions in recent months there have been news reports regarding actions about kava by government agencies in various countries reports of liverrelated risks associated with the use of kava have prompted regulatory agencies in countries including germany switzerland france canada and the united kingdom to take actions ranging from warning consumers about the potential risks of kava to removing kavacontaining products from the marketplace germany has been at the forefront of these activities and in early  the german government announced a nearly complete ban on the sale of kava herbal medicines in germany under the ruling the sale of kava is only allowed in homeopathic products that contain minute amounts of kava the chief herbal authority in germany – the german commission e – was apparently not consulted on the german government’s investigations recently the german commission e issued a press release indicating that it has reviewed available scientific data on the efficacy of kava and assessed the riskbenefit ratio and the therapeutic advantages and determined that it continues to support kava’s availability as prescribed in medical product the commission also indicated it is of the opinion that there is no imminent danger which justified the german government’s action fda statements in the united states the fda has issued a consumer advisory indicating that although liver damage appears to be rare the fda believes consumers should be informed of this potential risk the fda has indicated that persons who have liver disease or liver problems or persons who are taking drug products that can affect the liver should consult a physician before using kavacontaining supplements the fda has also stated that consumers who use a kavacontaining dietary supplement and who experience signs of illness associated with liver disease should consult their physician symptoms of serious liver disease include jaundice yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes and brown urine nonspecfic symptoms of liver disease can include nausea vomiting lightcolored stools unusual tiredness weakness stomach or abdominal pain and loss of appetite the fda has indicated that it is continuing its investigation into the relationship if any between the use of kavacontaining dietary supplements and liver injury the agency’s investigation includes attempting to determine a biological explanation for the relationship and to identify the different sources of kava in the us and europe the agency has indicated that it will alert consumers and if warranted take additional action as more information becomes available industry reaction in the us in the united states there are two primary trade organizations involved with the manufacture and sale of herbal products the council for responsible nutrition crn an the american herbal products association ahpa  crn is a sciencebased trade association for the dietary supplement industry that promotes responsible selfregulation and ahpa is a trade association devoted to the us herbal supplement industry in response to news reports about kava both crn and ahpa investigated the situation and developed cautionary statements for kavacontaining dietary supplements the crnsanctioned cautionary statement reads as follows caution the us fda advises that a potential risk of rare but severe liver injury may be associated with kavacontaining dietary supplements ask a health care professional before use if you have or have had liver problems frequently use alcoholic beverages or are taking any medication stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems including jaundice yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes and brown urine other nonspecific symptoms can include nausea vomiting lightcolored stools unusual tiredness weakness stomach or abdominal pain and loss of appetite not for use by persons under  years of age or by pregnant or breastfeeding women not for use with alcoholic beverages excessive use or use with products that cause drowsiness may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment crn provided this statement to the fda an on july   the fda sent a letter to crn indicating that it believes that crn’s caution statement regarding kavacontaining dietary supplements is useful in providing information to consumers about liver injury and can assist consumers in making decisions and choices about dietary supplements nutraceutical products nutraceutical corporation is a

kava piper methesticum update on and notice regarding california transparency in supply chains act of  january  in notices by nutraceuticalon january   the california transparency in supply chains act of  sb  “act” went into effect in the state of california the act is an attempt to seek the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking nutraceutical opposes slavery and human trafficking in any form and urges governments and government agencies around the world to take measures to eradicate these activities by outlawing and prosecuting violators we are committed to supporting these efforts as a small cap company in the united states if there are viable steps we can take we describe our current practices below overview of natural ingredient sourcing nutraceutical currently sells over  skus of products which incorporate over  raw materials with their ultimate sources likely including regions in virtually every country in the world many of these ingredients are planted and harvested using traditional techniques developed over centuries if not millennia while others are harvested using modern techniques the suppliers can range from large businesses to small familyowned farms coops and harvesting operations where products are sometimes wildcrafted ie harvested from the wild in some traditional family operations family members of all ages may participate together and support each other and in fact enjoy working together just as many farming operations in the united states have done since the founding of this country since growing conditions can change from year to year and season to season buyers who work for nutraceutical and for the natural product suppliers we purchase from must source these materials from a wide variety of vendors which can change from year to year or even season to season all of these factors create a particularly challenging situation for any company of our size to make a meaningful contribution in this area supply chain standards nutraceutical expects its suppliers to ensure that quality and safety standards are maintained throughout our supply chain by welltreated fairly compensated workers in accordance with all applicable laws our current efforts include the following standards our contracts with our suppliers requires that they commit to us that they ensure that their activities and the activities of their suppliers comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to slavery and human trafficking as well as our code of ethics verification and audits on those occasions when our purchasing team members have the opportunity to visit suppliers they are asked to take the opportunity to inspect storage production andor harvesting facilities and operations and ask appropriate questions we do not normally engage third parties to do this certification our purchase terms contain a clause under which our direct suppliers certify to us that they comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they do business internal accountability if we were to determine that an employee or contractor has violated a law regarding slavery and human trafficking this would constitute grounds for termination of the employment or supply relationship training our purchasing personnel have been instructed to review these statements and our contracting terms and comply with them our vice president over purchasing is

and notice regarding california transparency in supply chains act of  update on “dietary supplement safety act of ” and other attacks on dshea december  in notices by nutraceuticalin  senator john mccain raz and senator byron dorgan dnd proposed the dietary supplement safety act of  dssa as written it would have had the effect of gutting key protections currently provided by the dietary supplement health and education act dshea it would have also restored virtually unlimited control to the fda to decide what supplements you can take and at what levels – within this agency are many individuals who have long tried to shut down the natural health industry dssa denies individuals the freedom to protect their own health we were opposed to its passage after washington dc was flooded with hundreds of thousands of phone calls and emails from concerned citizens and after a phone call and public letter from senator hatch senator mccain withdrew his sponsorship for this bill however we should all remain vigilant to avoid any further erosion of the protections provided by dshea no matter who is sponsoring the proposal and no matter what bill it is hidden in here is some background dshea – this law has provided the framework for regulation of dietary supplements by fda since  it treats supplements as foods and gives fda authority to remove unsafe or adulterated products from the market it was the result of a massive grassroots effort to protect supplements from a history of overly aggressive regulation from fda see the positive commentspresident clinton made about it when he signed dshea into law see an overview of the history of dshea from a former general counsel of fda who reveals that fda purposefully delayed its enforcement for over  years   dssa will overturn dshea the passage of dssa would effectively eliminate the supplement protections contained in dshea it not only eliminates these protections but actually grants the fda unprecedented and arbitrary authority over what products you can take view the article on the alliance for natural health website or the article on the natural products association website to see a discussion of this issue the likely result of its passage a consolidation of the supplement industry into a few big companies selling many fewer supplements and ingredients at much lower doses and far fewer new products   dssa is an effort to divert attention – dssa appears to originate at least in part from major league sports teams who are trying to divert attention from illegal steroid use and their own failure to enforce antidoping rules one of the primary driving forces appears to be the us antidoping agency usada which is funded by major league sports teams including baseball football and others baseball commissioner bud selig has urged the adoption of dssa in his comments announcing the bill senator mccain cited six nfl players recently suspended for testing positive for banned substances who were allegedly exposed to these substances through “dietary supplements” these parties are all missing the point they should be focused on bringing an end to the underground and illegal conspiracy of suppliers trainers and athletes who work together to find new ways of hiding and taking steroids and other performance enhancing drugs which they might occasionally disguise as supplements all of this has nothing to do with the traditional dietary supplement industry these performance enhancing products and activities are or should be illegal and should be shut down by fda unfortunately fda has a wellknown history of failing to take illegal products off the market see the natural products insider article   dssa doesn’t solve any problems – dssa is unnecessary and harmful the fda already has complete authority to remove illegal steroids from the market and to regulate dietary supplements dssa won’t stop irresponsible companies or criminals from breaking the law and will only hurt responsible companies athletes who want to take illegal products will still be able to find them criminals who want to supply these athletes will still find ways to do it dssa is not the solution to the problems faced by major league sports the solution to that problem involves a major shift in sports culture and practices which cannot be resolved by a bill that punishes vitamin manufacturers sports leagues are pushing a proposal that unfairly punishes everyone instead of simply cleaning up their own house   who else is opposed the natural products association and the alliance for natural health have spoken out against this proposal see below we should all be vigilant to make sure someone doesn’t attempt to come up with a compromise bill senator mccain’s proposal and any compromise should be resisted at all costs   resources and links — consumers retailers natural care practitioners and others who are interested in opposing this proposal may wish to visit the following resources

supplement safety act of  and other attacks on dshea update on red yeast rice products january  in notices by nutraceuticalsome customers have contacted us regarding negative publicity about red yeast rice products marketed under our solaray® natural balance® and veglife® brands this publicity originated with a consumerlab review we want to reassure you that our manufacturing and testing processes are designed to ensure that our products meet applicable safety standards in the united states we believe that our products are safe when used as directed the consumerlab review should not be construed as evidence that our products are unsafe regulatory background on red yeast rice we sell traditional red yeast rice which is produced from the natural fermentation of the yeast monascus purpureus on rice red yeast rice traditionally contains trace amounts of lovastatin – however due to the regulatory status of red yeast rice we focus our efforts on sourcing red yeast rice that has been manufactured according to traditional methods which is the only kind of red yeast rice that meets fda’s regulatory requirements traditional red yeast rice has been consumed for centuries we think it is important to note that fda has historically pursued regulatory action against manufacturers and products that have moderate to high levels of lovastatin or make claims about the presence of lovastatin on their labels see for example these warning letters httpwwwfdagovicecienforcementactionswarninglettersucmhtm httpwwwfdagovicecienforcementactionswarninglettersucmhtm httpwwwfdagovicecienforcementactionswarninglettersucmhtm consumers should be cautious about purchasing products that are manufactured using techniques that increase or concentrate the amount of lovastatin above what is found in traditional red yeast rice some manufacturers may even be adding lovastatin in either case fda would take the position that such products should not be sold or purchased as they violate the law in numerous respects including lack of assurance of safety consumerlab review the consumerlab review contains some errors one of the primary errors is its failure to note that among health food store brands tested by consumerlab only solaray® natural balance® and veglife® products contained levels of lovastatin within the range that fda considers naturally occurring and safe in fact the consumerlab review suggests that consumers may wish to consider purchasing products with moderate to high levels of lovastatin – the very products that could be and have been subject to regulatory action and that fda considers to be unacceptable and unsafe for dietary supplements we have made some suggestions to consumerlab regarding its approach to creating and publishing standards and some improvements to its business model here is a copy of our letter to them citrinin screening we screen our red yeast rice using uplcms ultra performance liquid chromatographymass spectrophotometer detection current detection capabilities are down to  ppm citrinin safety consumerlab acknowledged in its review that there is no scientific basis to determine whether or not the levels of citrinin that consumerlab claimed to have found in our products and other products has any adverse health effects we have consulted an independent toxicologist who has confirmed to us that the levels referenced in the consumerlab report do not raise a safety issue nevertheless in order to continue to assure the highest level of quality for our products we have expanded our screening program tests for citrinin in all red yeast rice raw material down to  ppm conclusion nutraceutical has built its reputation as a superior quality supplement manufacturer by providing ingredients with guaranteed purity and potency we are noted for having among the most stringent testing and quality control standards in the industry and are audited by an external auditor routine tests are performed for aluminum lead and other heavy metals more than  pesticides herbicides and fungicides microbial contaminants such as e coli and salmonella disintegration time and of
