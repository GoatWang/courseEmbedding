at a different rate than what we quoted well shop your offer around to see if another life insurer can beat it all this service at no extra cost to you shouldnt i try more than one comparison siteyou can but weve worked hard to offer the easiest life insurance shopping experience youll find online we offer the widest selection of arated life insurance companies so that you can find the right policy for youalso any policy you see on our site wont be any cheaper at another comparison site thats because each life insurance company files its rates with state regulators and everyone is required to show those filed rates and if you see the same policy for a cheaper rate on another site  make sure youre comparing apples to apples is it for the same amount and term did the other site ask detailed health questions to make sure they can accurately quote you we do that but not every site doeswe stand by our promise  so we make it easy to save your quotes with us and email them to yourself to keep shopping and when youre ready to buy we hope youll come back to us how does policygenius make moneywe get paid a commission by the life insurance company when we help you find a life insurance policy submit an application and get approved commissions are already priced into the cost of life insurance  so youre not paying extra to work with us or any agent or broker our commissions are similar across the life insurers we work with so we never play favorites want to know how much commission we make feel free to ask usare the life insurance quotes on the policygenius site

instantly quote you which happens when someone has a more complicated health history one of our licensed advisors can custom quote youshouldnt i buy directly from a life insurance companytheres no reason to and a very big reason not to first you dont save any money by buying directly from the life insurance company by law the price you get from a given life insurance company is the same through them or through an agent or broker second the rate you get quoted may not be the rate youre approved at life insurance companies do a process called undewriting in which they look at your health history and risk profile to determine whether the rate they quoted is actually accurate if you apply with the life insurance company directly and youre approved at a different rate youre stuck they wont help you figure out if you can get a better offer elsewhere if you apply through policygenius well shop that offer around to every life insurance company we work with to see if they can beat it
