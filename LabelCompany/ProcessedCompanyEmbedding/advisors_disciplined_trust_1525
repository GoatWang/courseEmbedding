prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd  investment summary  investment objective the trust seeks to provide above average total return principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected using a specialized dividendoriented strategy that seeks above average total return wef selected the portfolio using the following strategy  we begin with the companies listed in the sp adr index the sp adr index is based on the nonus stocks comprising the sp global  index the sp adr index is made up of those companies from the sp global  index that offer either level ii or level iii american depositary receipts adrs global shares or ordinary shares in the case of canadian equities the sp global  index covers  countries and consists of seven regional components  from the sp adr index we identify the three stocks in each of the ten industry sector components of the sp adr index with the highest dividend yields  we select those  stocks for the trusts portfolio the ten industry sectors used in the strategy are the global industry classification standard sectors published by standard  poors and msci barra please note that we applied the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular time if we create additional units of the trust after the trusts inception date the trust will purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy this is true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities in addition companies which based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to the date of this prospectus are the target of an announced business combination which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this prospectus have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the trusts securities are selected principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these  stock prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time  an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units  the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period  the trusts performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested timing of the trust offering or timing of your investment and trust expenses  stocks of foreign companies held by the trust present risks beyond those of us issuers these risks may include market and political factors related to the companys foreign market international trade conditions less regulation smaller or less liquid markets increased volatility differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies  we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold and continue to buy shares of the same stocks even if their market value declines  f aam we and related terms mean advisors asset management inc the trust sponsor unless the context clearly suggests otherwise  investment summary pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th who should invest you should consider this investment if you want  to own a defined portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected based on historical dividend yields  to pursue a longterm dividendoriented investment strategy that includes investment in subsequent portfolios if available  the potential to receive dividend income and capital

organization costs plus  the sales fee the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price or purchase price the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if we receive your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your

responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the orders that they receive to us in a timely manner certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service approved by us in some cases we will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate we determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the

these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust pays these costs  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th transactional sales fee you pay a fee in connection with purchasing units we refer to this fee as the transactional sales fee the transactional sales fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals  of the public offering price per unit based on a  public offering price per unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the trusts inception date the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee as a result the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit varies the transactional sales fee does not include the creation and development fee which is described under expenses the maximum sales fee equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units the initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales fee will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit your trust pays the deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page  if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your units reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the fee you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your trust must charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amount of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units large purchases you can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase your fee will be  less than                or more  we apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase we also apply the different purchase levels on a unit basis using a  unit equivalent for example if you purchase between  and  units your fee is  of your public offering price per unit if you purchase units that qualify for the rolloverexchange option discount described below and also purchase additional units on the same day from the same brokerdealer that do not qualify for that discount you may aggregate the units that qualify for the rolloverexchange discount with the additional units purchased for purposes of qualifying for the purchase levels above on the additional units purchased you may aggregate unit orders

the public offering price for the new trust the trustee will attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the termination date we do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than one day however certain factors could affect the ability to sell the securities and could impact the length of the sale period the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day we intend to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year of course we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the same investment strategies or objectives as the current trust we cannot guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy

gains which are reinvested in connection with a rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the wash sale tax rules due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust no cash will be distributed to pay any taxes see taxes distributions monthly distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income prorated on an annual basis along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change when the trust receives dividends from a portfolio security the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts in an effort to make relatively regular income distributions the trusts monthly income distribution is equal to onetwelfth of the estimated net annual dividends to be received by the trust after deduction of trust operating expenses because the trust does not receive dividends from the portfolio securities at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in income distributions the trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee will be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from available income received by the trust on the ensuing record date estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual dividends received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in income payments received and with the sale of securities reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available

achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time strategy correlation risk is the risk that the trusts performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact weightings at a given time  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may be created at various times during the year and generally have  month terms  the trust may not be fully invested at all times and  trust fees and expenses foreign issuer risk because the trust invests in stocks of foreign companies the trust involves additional risks that differ from an investment exclusively in domestic stocks these risks include the risk of losses due to future political and economic developments international trade conditions foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities the trust also involves the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the stocks the trust involves the risk that information about the stocks is not publicly available or is inaccurate due to the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards in addition some foreign securities markets are less liquid than us markets this could cause the trust to buy stocks at a higher price or sell stocks at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid market foreign securities markets are often more volatile and involve higher trading costs than us markets and foreign companies securities markets and brokers are also generally not subject to the same level of supervision and regulation as in the us certain stocks may be held in the form of adrs or other similar receipts adrs represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian which may include the trustee of your trust the adrs in the trust if any trade in the us in us

initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or

the actual performance of the standard  poors adr index and the standard  poors  index in each of the years listed below and as of the most recent month end these hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the trust returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons such as  total return figures shown do not reflect

dates  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all stocks comprising its strategy and  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units you should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any index and it is not expected

circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should

regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into three categories ordinary income distributions capital gains dividends and return of capital ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or

disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide dividend income and capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected using a specialized dividendoriented strategy that seeks to outperform the standard  poors adr index there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors market risk because the trust invests in stocks you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock foreign issuers because a trust may invest in foreign stocks they involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that are published about issuers in the united states also foreign issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to united states issuers with respect to certain foreign countries there is the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation nationalization or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of the trust political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect united states  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd investments in those countries moreover industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the united states economy in terms of growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the united states while growing in volume they usually have substantially less volume than the new york stock exchange and securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable united states issuers fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on united states exchanges there is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed issuers than in the united states a trust may also involve the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the stocks for example if a foreign stock rose  in price but the us dollar gained  against the related foreign currency a us investors return would be reduced to about  this is because the foreign currency would buy fewer dollars or conversely a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the us dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency investor perceptions of world or country economies political instability currency speculation by institutional investors changes in government policies buying and selling of currencies by central banks of countries trade balances and changes in interest rates a trusts foreign currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot ie cash buying basis these dealers realize a profit based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency bid price and the price at which they sell the currency offer price the evaluator will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency exchange markets however due to the volatility of the markets and other factors the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate a trust might obtain had the trustee sold the currency in the market at that time smallcap and midcap companies while historically smaller company stocks have outperformed the stocks of large companies the former have customarily involved more investment risk as well smallcap and midcap companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies some of these companies may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the prices of small or midsize company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because smallcap and midcap companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd basic materials an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks an investment in securities of companies involved in the basic materials industry may entail companies in the basic materials sector are engaged in the manufacture mining processing or distribution of raw materials and intermediate goods used in the industrial sector these may include materials and products such as chemicals commodities forestry products paper products copper iron ore nickel steel aluminum precious metals textiles cement and gypsum basic materials companies may be affected by the volatility of commodity prices exchange rates import controls worldwide competition depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control devices in addition they may be adversely affected by technical progress labor relations and governmental regulation these companies are also at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns which may lead to poor investment returns consumer product and retail issuers the trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries various retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services industry your trust may concentrate in securities of issuers in the financial services industry banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes financial services companies have faced significant difficulty recently related to the recent downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets corresponding declines in the value of mortgagebacked securities and the resulting impact on all areas of the financial services industry and the broader economy these difficulties have given rise to considerable uncertainty regarding the global economy and financial services companies in particular the downturn has also led to considerable writedowns in the values of many assets held by financial services companies and a tightening of credit markets that has been marked by a general unwillingness of many entities to extend credit these factors have caused a significant need for many financial services companies to raise capital to meet obligations and to satisfy regulatory and contractual capital requirements many wellestablished financial services companies have been forced to seek additional capital through issuances of new preferred or common equity and certain companies have been forced to agree to be acquired by other companies or sell some or all of their assets to other companies in some cases government assistance guarantees or direct participation in investments or acquisitions have been necessary to facilitate these transactions in addition concerns regarding these issues and their potential negative impact to the us and global economies have resulted in extreme volatility in securities prices and uncertain market conditions  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in response to these issues government authorities in the us and other countries have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and legislative action intended to address both short and longterm difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets mortgage backed securities the financial services industry and the broader economy these government actions may include but are not limited to restrictions on investment activities increased oversight regulation and involvement in financial services company practices adjustments to capital requirements the acquisition of interests in and the extension of credit to private entities and increased investigation efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in the financial service industry no one can predict any action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as intended no one can predict the impact that the recent difficulties will have on the economy generally or financial services companies the recent difficulties and corresponding government action or inaction may have far reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely affected by such developments banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if

be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if the trust acquires reit securities at or near the top of
