sharecasinoderik mooberry mass market drives gaming evolutionby video on july   tags cai derik mooberry scientific gamesin this interview with calvinayrecom’s stephanie raquel derik mooberry of scientific games explains how mass market shapes igaming productsloading the player products are shaped by consumer demand companies produce products that they think will be patronized by many that’s why many companies devote resources to research in order to understand the behavior and spending pattern of consumersthe good thing about consumerdetermined products is that they drive suppliers to innovate their offeringscase in point are the electronic table games in macau during macau’s heyday gambling suppliers have developed more offerings intended for vips since these clients were the ones bringing in money to the businessthis however changed when beijing launched a corruption crackdown and high rollers were forced to avoid macau the exodus of vip gamblers prompted gaming operators and suppliers to change their business strategy by focusing on the mass marketderik mooberry of scientific games pointed out that product innovation has been the key for gaming operators to tap into the potential of macau’s mass market he said gaming technology providers such as scientific games have been working with gambling operators to entice the mass market to gamble“as a manufacturer i think it provides opportunity to show are innovation and highlight a lot of the new products and features we’ve been working on” mooberry told calvinayrecom “i think as the market here in macau evolves and you get more of the mass market consumer i think slots which have historically been a small percentage of play here i think we could look to see that evolve and i think you could see new styles of machines new play mechanics new form factors that makes it more exciting for the operators as well”mooberry said electronic table games are designed so as not to intimidate the mass market partly by adding lower bet options for them this allows a different price point which he said is more efficient“from a consumer perspective it gives you the benefit of playing in what i call ‘a nonintimidating format’ live table games if you are not used to them can be very intimidating” he said “so as you think about mass market then that provides benefit to them so you really have a winwin situation for both the operator and the consumer”at present mooberry said that electronic games are booming and expanding from asia to the americas and europe he predicts that products will continue to evolve especially now that the world becomes more digital“i think that is an expectation that will evolve in most markets around the world it just really becomes a question of time” he said commentsviews and

january   features people to watch  derik mooberry by frank legato fri dec   share on twitterfacebooklinkedin senior vice president of games table game products and interactive research and development bally technologies if his official title is a mouthful it’s because his range of responsibilities has just grown significantly derik mooberry has been an executive of bally technologies for  years and that means he has taken part in the supplier’s transformation from a struggling slot manufacturer into a diverse supplier of technology and innovation in just about every facet of the delivery of games to casinos beginning in systems sales mooberry was part of the boom that solidified bally’s position as the top systems company in the business his responsibilities gradually evolved to oversight of all game and system development and with the completion last month of the acquisition of shfl entertainment of proprietary table games—all of it on both brickandmortar and online channels from casinos to pcs to mobile phones and tablets “i’ve really had the pleasure of watching bally grow over  years and i’ve been able to grow along with it” says mooberry that growth is really just beginning as senior vp in charge of both slot and table games as well as the new move into interactive products mooberry will continue his role of guiding products from the idea phase to implementation by customers “i have endtoend responsibility for design building and placement of our games in various marketplaces” he explains “that includes hardware engineering software engineering regulatory compliance product management—everything in terms of getting the products ready for sale” the addition of development staff from shfl entertainment—including game design whiz roger snow among others—adds to a game design studio system that has been growing for years with more than  game development studios located around the world “building games for us is truly global as are the marketplaces we sell our games in” mooberry says “those studios will likely continue to expand we’re always looking for new game development talent as a growing company it seems we’re always in a recruitment mode which is a fantastic position to be in” bally’s mix of talent includes more than simply seasoned gaming industry veterans “some of our most creative people who work in our various game development teams came to bally with basically no understanding of the gaming environment” mooberry says “they may have had background in graphics or animation and may even have come from the video game industry or other areas outside of that we’ve had employees form disney and other major companies join bally and become fantastic game developers” as bally moves forward that talent is in charge of pushing the technological envelope more than ever part of mooberry’s job is to identify market needs for specific bally products and to in the end make them happen in the igaming space that has meant not only the development of bally’s igaming platform but the effective transfer of bally content to online channels “if you look at the early games we’ve been deploying in the realmoney wagering space and intend to deploy in the mobile space they are existing bally games that have been some of our most successful titles in the traditional brickand mortar environment” he says “we look to capitalize on that brand recognition and on the efforts we’ve expended in building those games for the landbased environment and take them into other channels” for the coming year those efforts will apply not only to the traditional bally slot games but to shfl tablegame entries like let it ride caribbean stud and  card poker on the brickandmortar side mooberry will continue to work closely with bryan kelly and his “innovation lab” which searches the larger world of technology for new play mechanics and other features that can be applied to bally slots “bryan’s team thinks of innovative ideas that can be industrychanging which are  months out and further” he says “we then carefully determine which of the many ideas to commercialize” many of those ideas—the ideck the pro curve cabinet—have already become part of the bally product lineup for  mooberry predicts the biggest news will be the rollout of the pro wave cabinet which employs a inch concave screen that can handle content from any other bally setup including the popular v portraitstyle cabinet mooberry calls the new cabinet a hybrid between an upright and a slanttop because it offers the real estate for game features of a large upright in a format that can be easily viewed from a seated position it’s just one more innovation that mooberry has brought from concept to market and it certainly won’t be the last for mooberry that’s a byproduct of what he calls the best supplier team in the business “it’s the people that make bally great” he says “and it’s been a great run for me” it’s a run that shows no
