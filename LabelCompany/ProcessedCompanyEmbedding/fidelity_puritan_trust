riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment

probiotic supplement buyer’s guide for july  which probiotic supplement works best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking probiotics taken antibiotics antiinflammatory pain meds or birth control in the last few years experienced digestive issues such as constipation diarrhea gas bloating upset stomach or have even had food poisoning at some point noticing skin blemishes acne dullness in skin rosacea psoriasis or eczema feeling depressed moody irritable brain fog or low energy get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year the importance of a “balanced gut” our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body the gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components carbohydrates fats proteins which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration it also regulates hormones and activates the immune system our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms bacteria fungi and viruses when in balance the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes yeasts and parasites which can cause an imbalance what is “leaky gut” syndrome our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response building up antibodies to fight back the problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones as these attacks continue over time it can lead to a variety of health problems a “leaky gut” may not be your fault the reality is that antibiotics pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut the processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes all of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria leading to gut and immune system disruption the results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs gas bloating constipation diarrhea and heartburn the internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne rosacea psoriasis and even eczema and if all of that was not bad

owned by the trademark holders and respective companies x x x probiotic pill reviews probiotic pill reviews probiotic supplement buyer’s guide for july  which probiotic supplement works best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking probiotics taken antibiotics antiinflammatory pain meds or birth control in the last few years experienced digestive issues such as constipation diarrhea gas bloating upset stomach or have even had food poisoning at some point noticing skin blemishes acne dullness in skin rosacea psoriasis or eczema feeling depressed moody irritable brain fog or low energy get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year the importance of a “balanced gut” our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body the gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components carbohydrates fats proteins which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration it also regulates hormones and activates the immune system our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms bacteria fungi and viruses when in balance the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes yeasts and parasites which can cause an imbalance what is “leaky gut” syndrome our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response building up antibodies to fight back the problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones as these attacks continue over time it can lead to a variety of health problems a “leaky gut” may not be your fault the reality is that antibiotics pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut the processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes all of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria leading to gut and immune system disruption the results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs gas bloating constipation diarrhea and heartburn the internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne rosacea psoriasis and even eczema and if all of that was not bad enough an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression low energy and memory and recall issues this is why it is critical to rebalance your gut with a “quality” probiotic “good gut” bacteria secrets you may not have known you have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord your gut has  trillion bacteria  pounds worth and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body that’s a lot of cells in your gut having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function want glowing and clear skin good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin a surprising  of the serotonin the happy molecule in your brain is made in your gut balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity how probiotic supplements work probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the overcolonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is  “good” bacteria to  “bad” bacteria although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish it is essential to choose a highquality probiotic brand with the correct strains in the correct proportions to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria   our probiotic research approach to determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed second we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences lastly we took a close look at online marketplaces like amazon and ebay to see what other actual customers were saying we then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best probiotic supplement products available today  essential ingredient criteria to a quality probiotic probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help reculture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits but our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective it must have meet these  key ingredient criteria number of cfus colonyforming units cfus indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is the higher number of cfus in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of cfus they have the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is  billion cfus anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective multiple strains a recent study by stanford university’s dr david relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria a probiotic brand that has at least  different strains is optimal keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues substrains one of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label a substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality avoid brands that do not list the substrain it is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used to find the substrain examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label as shown in the example below the substrain will be located to the right of each strain followed by a trademark symbol bifidobacterium lactis bi™ prebiotics since probiotics are living microorganisms they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut a “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car without it you won’t go far for long a good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics such as the popular nutraflora™ fiber for it be most effective at reculturing your gut with good bacteria dark amber glass bottle probiotics are extremely sensitive to light moisture and oxygen these harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light  plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture don’t waste your hardearned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle nonrefrigeration it is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora we have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration today technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature a good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins beware of dead probiotics there have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly causing the essential colonyforming units cfus in them to die leaving customer with useless products don’t let yourself become a victim key indicators of a “trustworthy brand” customer satisfaction we gathered thousands of inclusion of prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work you want a company with an established reputation if they don’t have positive reviews avoid buying from them moneyback guarantee it is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” moneyback guarantee you don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you if a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee take that as a red flag the  rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading no questions asked year money back guarantee we love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products thirdparty quality testing probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf a good brand will guarantee that the cfus they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least year from the date of purchase it’s important to know that what a company advertises is actually in the pill be sure to pick a company who has thirdparty testing and verification of the ingredients on their label lastly we sought out real customers who used these products and asked them about their experiences and

awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

guide for july  which probiotic supplement works best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking probiotics taken antibiotics antiinflammatory pain meds or birth control in the last few years experienced digestive issues such as constipation diarrhea gas bloating upset stomach or have even had food poisoning at some point noticing skin blemishes acne dullness in skin rosacea psoriasis or eczema feeling depressed moody irritable brain fog or low energy get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year the importance of a “balanced gut” our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body the gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components carbohydrates fats proteins which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration it also regulates hormones and activates the immune system our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms bacteria fungi and viruses when in balance the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes yeasts and parasites which can cause an imbalance what is “leaky gut” syndrome our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response building up antibodies to fight back the problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones as these attacks continue over time it can lead to a variety of health problems a “leaky gut” may not be your fault the reality is that antibiotics pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut the processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes all of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria leading to gut and immune system disruption the results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs gas bloating constipation diarrhea and heartburn the internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne rosacea psoriasis and even eczema and if all of that was not bad enough an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression low energy and memory and recall issues this is why it is critical to rebalance your gut with a “quality” probiotic “good gut” bacteria secrets you may not have known you have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord your gut has  trillion bacteria  pounds worth and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body that’s a lot of cells in your gut having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function want glowing and clear skin good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin a surprising  of the serotonin the happy molecule in your brain is made in your gut balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity how probiotic supplements work probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the overcolonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is  “good” bacteria to  “bad” bacteria although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish it is essential to choose a highquality probiotic brand with the correct strains in the correct proportions to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria   our probiotic research approach to determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed second we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences lastly we took a close look at online marketplaces like amazon and ebay to see what other actual customers were saying we then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best probiotic supplement products available today  essential ingredient criteria to a quality probiotic probiotics are live microorganisms if taken in the correct amounts can help reculture your gut by building up the “good gut bacteria” yielding a wide array of health benefits but our research and analysis has shown that for a probiotic supplement to be effective it must have meet these  key ingredient criteria number of cfus colonyforming units cfus indicate how dense or potent the bacteria in the probiotic is the higher number of cfus in a probiotic can mean it has a higher impact on the growth of “good bacteria” within your gut flora our research indicated that although many companies try to sell you on simply the number of cfus they have the critical number to have in a good probiotic supplement is  billion cfus anything above that and you are just paying for marketing hype as it has not been shown to be more effective multiple strains a recent study by stanford university’s dr david relman discovered that the gut contains thousands of unique strains of bacteria a probiotic brand that has at least  different strains is optimal keep in mind that if you have a specific digestive issue there may be certain strains that are more recognized for their ability to fight the bad bacteria that are causing your issues substrains one of the signs of a quality probiotic brand is if the company lists the specific substrain for each probiotic strain noted on their label a substrain is an indication that the specific probiotic strain being used in the formula has gone through clinical studies to insure its quality avoid brands that do not list the substrain it is usually an indication that a generic lower quality strains are being used to find the substrain examine the supplement facts portion of a brands label as shown in the example below the substrain will be located to the right of each strain followed by a trademark symbol bifidobacterium lactis bi™ prebiotics since probiotics are living microorganisms they need food to stay alive and to grow in your gut a “prebiotic” is a soluble fiber which probiotics feed upon to stimulate their growth in your gut prebiotics are like the gas you put in your car without it you won’t go far for long a good probiotic brand needs to contain prebiotics such as the popular nutraflora™ fiber for it be most effective at reculturing your gut with good bacteria dark amber glass bottle probiotics are extremely sensitive to light moisture and oxygen these harmful elements can easily leak through plastic bottles during storage and shipping and cause the living probiotic microorganisms to die only a dark amber glass bottle can keep out harmful moisture and light  plastic bottles can render probiotics useless as they are permeable to varying degrees of moisture don’t waste your hardearned money by taking the risk with a plastic bottle your safest choice is a brand which uses a dark amber glass bottle nonrefrigeration it is important to take a probiotic “each day with consistency” to maintain optimal gut flora we have heard from many of our readers about the challenges with probiotics which require refrigeration today technology has advanced the ability to freeze dry probiotics and allowing them to be stable at room temperature a good quality probiotic which does not require refrigeration can be effective and will increase the likelihood you will take it each day like any of your other vitamins beware of dead probiotics there have been reports of companies failing to store or ship their probiotics properly causing the essential colonyforming units cfus in them to die leaving customer with useless products don’t let yourself become a victim key indicators of a “trustworthy brand” customer satisfaction we gathered thousands of inclusion of prebiotics from online marketplaces to determine which had the most top rated reviews so we can see which products really work you want a company with an established reputation if they don’t have positive reviews avoid buying from them moneyback guarantee it is important to find a company who has a “no hassle” moneyback guarantee you don’t want to be wasting your time arguing with a company that won’t let you return a product that is not working for you if a company won’t stand behind their product with a guarantee take that as a red flag the  rated brand in our rankings below has an industry leading no questions asked year money back guarantee we love when we see brands who are committed to standing behind their products thirdparty quality testing probiotics are live organisms and will begin to die off over time of they sit for long periods on a shelf a good brand will guarantee that the cfus they claim their product contains will test out to the claim amount for at least year from the date of purchase it’s important to know that what a company advertises is actually in the pill be sure to pick a company who has thirdparty testing and verification of the ingredients on their label lastly we sought out real customers who used these products
