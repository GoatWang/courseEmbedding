commercialgrade window products as a result of favorable degradation and stability outcomes the company will direct resources to accelerate important durability and productlifecycle testing efforts effective immediately solarwindow™ products under development include rapidpayback electricitygenerating windows for installation on the estimated  million tall towers and detached homes in the united states dr scott hammond principal scientist solarwindow technologies inc setting up for solarwindow™ minimodule performance measurement according to latest power and financial modeling solarwindow™ systems boast the industry’s fastest known financial return and could achieve payback within one year to produce the equivalent amount of power with conventional solar systems would require at least  years for payback and at least  acres of valuable urban land “our solarwindow™ products are being developed to performance standards which give real estate developers engineers architects building designers and future customers plenty of financial incentive of course we also want to instill the confidence that comes with industryduration warranties” explained mr john a conklin president and ceo of solarwindow™ technologies inc solarwindow™ devices have been undergoing testing of their durability in an effort to meet or exceed warranty periods for commercialgrade insulated glass units igus installed on tall towers durability determines productlifecycle an important feature to the commercial adoption of solarwindow™ products for generating electricity on glass windows among tests conducted by researchers have been measurements to evaluate the durability degradation and performance of solarwindow™ coatings these liquid coatings are organic and generate electricity while remaining seethrough researchers validated the electromechanical stability and performance of these coatings additional tests were conducted to include packaging a series of technical processes being developed by the company for applying special sealants to solarwindow™ devices these tests measured factors related to durability reliability degradation integrity and performance of seals these special seals are applied along areas where moisture or weather elements could potentially create wear and tear moisture can cause erosion an especially important factor to the lifecycle of window products “i’m pleased that durability tests of solarwindow™ coatings and their associated sealants have generated a level of performance we believe is essential to commercial warranty standard our

technologies im not a believerapr  about solarwindow technologies wndw hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummarywndws financials appear to be insufficient to support the companys stated goals management compensation vastly exceeds the investment in rd and equipment the biggest shareholder was previously fined by the sec and controls most of the companys stock i have attempted to contact management but have not heard back yet background solarwindow technologies inc otcqbwndw is a developmentstage company that claims to be developing seethrough solar panels that can be used in place of standard glass windows as a source of renewable energy the company claims that these products can be used as an alternativeenergy solution which can be used to replace conventional glass in buildings it sounds like an intriguing concept but if one examines the companys public filings and history and compares them with the statements presented by the company its clear that there is a discontinuity between the information presented on the companys website at solarwindowcom and what its filings disclose solarwindow technologies inc was originally incorporated in nevada in  under the name octillion corp it changed its name to new energy technologies inc in december of  and again changed its name to solarwindow technologies inc on march   business and corporate website as mentioned before solarwindow technologies is engaged in developing seethrough solar panels that can replace standard glass windows and be used as a source of power generation from page  of the companys most recent k wndw describes its business as follows we are a prerevenue developer of transparent electricitygenerating solarwindow™ coatings our solarwindow™ technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a seethrough semitransparent coating of opv solar cells applied to glass and plastics our solarwindow™ technology is the subject of a patent pending technology our motionpower™ technology harvests kinetic or motion energy from vehicles when they slow down before coming to a stop and converts this captured energy into electricity our motionpower™ technology is the subject of fiftynine  patent filings we do not currently have any commercial products and there is no assurance that we will successfully be able to design develop manufacture or sell any commercial products in the future our product development programs involve ongoing research and development rd and product development efforts and the commitment of significant resources to support the extensive invention design engineering testing prototyping and intellectual property initiatives carriedout by our contract engineers scientists and consultants ultimately we plan to market any solarwindow™ technology products through comarketing copromotion licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators we believe that this approach could provide immediate access to preexisting distribution channels therefore potentially increasing market penetration and commercial acceptance of our products and enabling us to avoid expending significant funds for development of a large sales and marketing organization we cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully commercialize our solarwindow™ technology the actual cost and time required to commercialize our solarwindow™ technology may vary significantly depending on among other things the results of our rd efforts the cost of developing acquiring or licensing various enabling technologies changes in the focus and direction of our rd programs competitive and technological advances the cost of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing claims with respect to patents the regulatory approval process and manufacturing marketing and other costs associated with commercialization of these technologies because of this uncertainty even if financing is available to us we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business plan from this description the company tells us that they are currently developing the technology and that it has filed for patents but its clear that any productionready product is a long way off and the company readily admits that they have no timetable or funding estimates to complete its projects with respect to motionpower very little detail is given about this product  it seems extremely similar to what hybrid cars are doing right now with regenerative braking and there is no detail about what makes it unique while the company boasts of  patent filings it is unclear whether there is any possibility of these becoming monetized and the company does not explain why it switched from working on this technology to solely investing in its solarwindow product the companys corporate website is slick and polished with an aesthetically pleasing presentation however there is little factual material information there  there are a lot of references to the companys press releases and pictures of people in white lab coats gawking at tinted glass but no hard details or data about any progress that the company has made on its product additionally there is no careers section on the website  id expect that a company that is still developing a product would be in need of scientists researchers and skilled craftsmen in order to make its vision a reality but there is no information about getting a job there financials the companys financials indicate that the company is operating on a shoestring budget and is quickly running out of cash additionally managements compensation seems extremely generous for a publicly traded company that is in such poor financial shape balance sheet from the companys most recent q filed on april   the company has  in cash and cash equivalents and total assets of  its important to note that of these assets only  constitute equipment on the liabilities side the company has  in accounts payable  in interest payable and convertible debt in the amount of  totaling  in current liabilities not looking too good…hows the income statement look income statement the companys most recent income statement lists a net loss of  million zero revenue no surprise as it doesnt have a marketable product yet and operating expenses of  of which  constitute selling general and administrative and  are research and development if we scroll further down to page  of the q the results of operations section lists  in sga  in rd and  in stock compensation for the three months ended february   which lets us know that some of the expense for sga and rd was paid in stock while its nice that the company disclosed this it really highlights wndws cash shortfall if they feel the need to pay for things this way cash flow the cash flow statement for the six months ended february   is rather interesting  it shows that the company used  million in its operations but only spent  on equipment which seems like a minimal sum for a company that claims to be developing cuttingedge technology additionally the cash flow statement shows that the company also received  in proceeds from issuance of stock given that the company has only just over k in the bank and its operations used over  million in six months its clear that it cant continue down the current path and the companys auditors agree with me on page  of the q there is a going concern notice which reads the company does not have any commercialized products and has not generated any revenue since inception the company has an accumulated deficit of  as of february   and does not have positive cash flow from operating activities included in the deficit are noncash expenses totaling  relating to the issuance of stock for services compensatory stock options warrants granted for value and accretion of debt discounts the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america which contemplates continuation of the company as a going concern which is dependent upon the companys ability to establish itself as a profitable business in its report with respect to the companys financial statements for the year ended august   the companys independent auditors expressed substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue operations as a going concern because the company has not generated revenues from its operations and does not expect to do so in the near future its ability to continue as a going concern is wholly dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing currently the company is seeking additional financing but has no commitments to obtain any such financing and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company if at all as of february   the company had cash of  on march   subsequent to its quarter end the company entered into a bridge loan agreement pursuant to which the company borrowed  based upon its current and near term anticipated level of operations and expenditures the company believes that cash on hand should be sufficient to enable it to continue operations through june  if adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms or at all it would result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results financial condition and prospects in particular the company may be required to delay reduce the scope of or terminate its research programs sell rights to its solarwindow™ technology andor motionpowertm technology or other technologies or products based upon such technologies or license the rights to such technologies or products on terms that are less favorable to the company than might otherwise be available in view of these conditions the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations these consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which will be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements this seems pretty bleak  only enough cash to continue operations until june in the liquidity and capital resources section on page  of the q it states management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements and continue to operate additional financing will be necessary we expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to maintain andor expand the range and scope of our business operations indicating that managements plan to remedy the situation is to go further into debt and to issue more stock thereby diluting current shareholders even further management compensation and major shareholders the companys most recent k states that for  the president ceo cfo and director received a salary of  in cash  in stock awards  in option awards and  in all other compensation totaling  it seems troubling that a company which admits that it will have enough cash to carry its operations for a few months would be so generous with its compensation  the ceos salary alone exceeds the companys current cash holdings of  and all of the additional stock and option compensation make it look like the ceo is more concerned with immediate financial rewards than longterm success how is the company supposed to pay for rd and additional employees if so much is being spent on the ceos compensation beyond the outrageous executive compensation its important to note that there are several significant shareholders of the companys common stock beyond the executives andor directors these include two entities identified as kalen capital corporation which owns  million shares or  and  alberta ltd which owns  million shares or  on a fullydiluted basis if one looks at the most recent q there are  million shares outstanding indicating that there are shares from the companys convertible note that have not been converted to common shares yet if one looks at page  of the most recent sa it explains that an additional  million shares would become outstanding following the conversion of the convertible note kalen capital corporation a quick google search for kalen capital corporation yields an interesting result  the first hit is for httpharmelrayatcom a website which reads harmel rayat is an investor entrepreneur and business owner based in vancouver canada he is the owner of and kalen capital corporation the second is a wikipedia page for harmel s rayat which appears to be directly copyandpaste of the content of the harmelrayatcom website mentioned previously interesting but it gets even more intriguing looking deeper into harmel s rayat there is an sec order imposing a ceaseand desist action from  which names him he was charged with running equityalertcom which the sec identified as a stock promotion email list remember when we noted that the company was founded as octillion if we dig a bit deeper further there is some decent investigative coverage on it from another seeking alpha writer covering the companys previous involvement with mr rayat among other issues  alberta ltd on page  of the companys most recent k filed on august   it reads  shares beneficially owned by  alberta ltd for the benefit of kalen jai rayat kalen jai rayat is mr rayats son see footnote  for additional information or  the  shares beneficially owned by  alberta ltd a private alberta corporation wholly owned by jasbinder chohan as the trustee under the tjr family trust dated august   for the benefit of talia jevan rayat mr rayats daughter mr rayat is not a beneficiary or trustee of the aforementioned trusts and disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares owned by each of his childrens trusts so it appears that over  of the companys stock is controlled by harmel rayat or his family someone who has previously been accused of the sec by wrongdoing in looking for greater detail regarding the company and its past looked through all of the companys form ks filed with the sec going back to  through all of these filings there were several major consistencies between them the employee count has always been extremely low the maximum number of employees that the company has ever disclosed in any of them is four and executive compensation has always been extremely high typically being at least six figures in salary and millions in stock andor options for the top executive and yet all the company has to show for it is a  million accumulated deficit and no material progress beyond an abandoned project employees and business location additionally the company disclosed that as of august   it only has three fulltime employees and is operating out of an office which it shares with a law firm at  little patuxent parkway suite  columbia maryland  the company does list an additional office in tampa florida a google search for the address  hidden river parkway suite  tampa florida  reveals several different tenants and businesses but no reference to solarwindow technologies or its predecessor new energy technologies inc beyond the ambiguous tenant situation the office is described as being  square feet and pictures show that it appears to be a standard office which appears to have insufficient workspace and equipment and space for conducting the research that wndw claims to be doing at least without major renovations which would likely cost far more than the amount that the company spent on equipment while management states we believe that our office facilities are sufficient and adequate for our purposes given our present staff and research objective it seems incredibly limited for a  million publiclytraded company that claims to be developing cuttingedge technology the company makes no other mention of any other significant workspaces in its filings while the company does have one postdoc research employee i find it difficult to believe that he alone is capable of designing developing and testing such cuttingedge technology in an office shared with a law firm and with such a limited amount of funding for equipment recent publicity on april   the company issued a press release announcing that an independent validation confirms oneyear solarwindow financial payback however there is little given as proof that the companys technology works or is even close to being ready  the entire financial model in the press release appears to be based on assumptions from an undeveloped and untested product given this context the press release reads as if it is begging potential shareholders to buy stock rather than a material update on the companys development progress claim such as compared to conventional rooftop solar systems solarwindow™ technology installed on a story building could generate up to times greater power while delivering times the environmental benefits according to company engineers for conventional solar systems to produce the equivalent amount of power as solarwindow™ would require at least  acres of valuable urban land at least  years for payback sound great but are not given any context and are not backed by any data in the press release conclusion given the companys financial situation past history and current resources it is my opinion that wndws current valuation of over  million at the time of this writing is not justified the company is burning through cash at an untenable rate and its workforce is too limited in experience and manpower to achieve its goals the company has been issued a going concern notice by its auditors and management admits that it plans to raise capital through equity issuances which will lead to further dilution of current shareholders the fact that management has for years been extremely generous with their own compensation in cash stock and warrants shareholders money in effect while spending little on equipment needed for research is a major problem and they have little to show for it except for a massive accumulated deficit while the companys principal scientist does have a phd in organicmaterials chemistry the company has been investing very little in equipment that he could use to advance its projects beyond the material woes and excessive executive compensation the biggest red flag is the companys largest shareholder has previously been involved in stock promotions and was even previously fined by the sec for  ironically the only red flag that i havent seen from this company is a series of promotional emails in an attempt to boost the stock price but it would not surprise me at all if i were to see some hit my inbox in the future disclosure the author is short wndw the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their

nevada corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries overview we are a prerevenue company developing our proprietary solarwindowtm transparent electricity generating coatings our solarwindowtm technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a transparent coating of organic photovoltaic opv layers applied to glass flexible glass and plastic surfaces and could potentially be used on any of the more than  million commercial and residential buildings in the united states alone our solarwindowtm technology is the subject of  pending patents the development of our solarwindowtm technology continues to advance under the stevensonwydler cooperative research and development agreement the nrel crada with the alliance for sustainable energy llc the alliance for sustainable energy which is the operator of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel table of contents we have achieved numerous important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in the development of our solarwindowtm technology including the ability to generate electricity on glass while remaining transparent and the application of our coatings on to glass at room temperature and pressure a brief list of some of our more important milestones includes � entered into the nrel crada which is still in effect � filed fourteen patent applications for our electricitygenerating coating and solarwindowtm technology development efforts that are independent of both the usf sponsored research and nrel crada research expanded the use of our solarwindowtm coatings to include two new product determined the correct combination of compounds to create a single solar scaledup from a single solar cell to a oneinch by oneinch array an � developed a method for spraying our seethrough electricitygenerating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperaturespecific and high positive or negative pressuresensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar pv manufacturing � invented and fabricated novel contacts that conduct electricity on solarwindowtm yet remain seethrough conventional contacts for conducting electricity use materials which generally block visibility and inhibit transparency sometimes otherwise creating visible lines on or in the window � engineered new methods for absorbing light energy to improve the flow of electrons negatively charged particles a process fundamental to generating electricity necessary for power appliances and fixtures in principle this advancement increases the efficiency of the solar cell and hence its ability to create more electricity from a given level of solar irradiation � discovered new solutionbased compounds that successfully mobilize the electrons necessary for generating electricity on solarwindowtm and eliminated the use of other materials that could be prone to breakdown or failure we have been able to produce these compounds from comparatively inexpensive starting materials and have discovered methods that allow for reproducibility � created methods for increasing power output by maximizing the number of solarcells present in our solarwindowtm array for a defined surface area � successfully scaledup solarwindowtm prototypes from a oneinch square to a twelveinch square  square inches in surface area � generated electricity on flexible plastic using novel seethrough solarwindowtm coatings � developed new solarwindowtm coatings with increased transparency and improved color � successfully fabricated the latest working window prototype using a faster rapid scaleup process for applying solutionbased coatings � produced the largest opv device ever fabricated at nrel in the institutes history � successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually invisible conductive wiring system developed for solarwindowtm completed performance tests of the transparent electricitygenerating � successfully processed solarwindowtm transparent electricity generating glass through rigorous high pressure and temperature processing of a commercial autoclave system in order to create a laminated window pane at a window fabricator and demonstrated that the solarwindowtm coatings continued to perform after the autoclave processing table of contents we are currently developing products collectively the solarwindowtm products derived from our solarwindowtm technology designed to address several potential markets including � solarwindowtm  commercial  a flat glass product for installation in new commercial towers under construction and replacement windows � solarwindowtm  structural glass  structural glass walls and curtains for tall structures � solarwindowtm  architectural glass  textured and decorative interior glass walls room dividers etc � solarwindowtm  residential  a window glass for installation in new residential homes under construction and replacement windows � solarwindowtm  flex  flexible films which may be applied directly onto previously installed window glass similar to aftermarket window tint films for retrofit to existing commercial towers buildings and residential homes note these flexible films can also be applied to new construction windows � solarwindowtm retrofit veneer  transparent tinted and flexible veneers that installers can apply directly on to existing windows our focus is on the development and deployment of solarwindowtmcommercial structural and architectural products our product development efforts have produced early working prototypes for these applications which we are sharing with potential commercialization partners commercialization of the solarwindowtm technology will require significant further capital research development and testing this additional work should enable us to ascertain whether the solarwindowtm technology can form the basis for a commercially viable technology or product and which products will be first to market solarwindowtm retrofit veneer products are being developed as transparent tinted flexible veneers that can be applied directly on to existing windows this expanded product line broadens our market reach beyond new and replacement installations to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the us alone this retrofit veneer product will be developed in parallel to the other solarwindowtm products currently undergoing further development recently we have developed the capability to integrate transparent solarwindowtm coatings on to flexible glass this presents new product opportunities for curved and nonflat surfaces in automotive aircraft and military applications by applying solarwindowtm coatings on to flexible glass we can develop products with the flexibility of plastic and yet maintain the durability scratchresistance and ease of maintenance of rigid glass we do not currently have any commercial products and there is no assurance that we will successfully be able to design develop manufacture or sell any commercial products in the future our product development programs involve ongoing rd and product development efforts and the commitment of significant resources to support the extensive invention design engineering testing prototyping and intellectual property initiatives carriedout by our contract engineers scientists and consultants table of contents we plan to market any solarwindowtm products we commercialize through comarketing and copromotion licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators to advance the technical development and subsequent commercialization of our solarwindowtm products we are actively seeking technology and product licensing and joint venture arrangements and manufacturing process integration relationships with commercial partners and industry and organizations which have established technical competencies market reach and mature distribution networks in the solar pv buildingintegrated pv and alternative and renewable energy market industries and further research institutions we believe that this approach could provide immediate access to preexisting distribution channels which can increase the market penetration and commercial acceptance of our products and enable us to avoid expending significant funds for development of a large sales and marketing organization we have not yet entered into any such arrangements we cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully commercialize our solarwindowtm technology the actual cost and time required to commercialize our solarwindowtm technology may vary significantly depending on among other things the results of our rd efforts the cost of developing acquiring or licensing various enabling technologies changes in the focus and direction of our rd programs competitive and technological advances the cost of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing claims with respect to patents the regulatory approval process and manufacturing marketing and other costs associated with commercialization of these technologies because of this uncertainty even if financing is available to us we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business plan as of may   we had a working capital deficit of  and cash of  subsequent to may   the company received proceeds of  from the exercise of  series m warrants based upon current and near term anticipated level of operations and expenditures we believe that cash on hand should be sufficient to enable us to continue operations through october  management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements and continue to operate additional financing will be necessary we expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations we will seek access to private or public equity markets but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty research and related agreements we
