investment was rmb  billion or  billion with that operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator your first question is from the line of amanda chen your line is now open please proceed with your question amanda chen  morgan stanley asia ltd hi management thank you for taking my questions my question is regarding the international market the first one is i think james you mentioned that – you shared some updates on the international expansion especially with development of skyscanner im wondering could you share some updates in other areas such as the development of ctrips organic outbound travel business and the cooperation with makemytrip and priceline et cetera and then the second question is we noticed that you have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet i think the stock performance is quite good as well and if i read the number correctly i think you borrowed around like rmb  billion shortterm loan for the quarter so shall we expect more international ma to come in near term and if so what kind of company that ctrip might prefer its a company with more online traffic and content or its a company with more offline resources thank you james jianzhang liang  ctripcom international ltd yeah international market will be a huge opportunity for growth for years to come our strategy first is to develop more complete product offering china will be the largest travel market in the world and our scale advantage will give us advantage in providing product services to nonchinese customers especially in east asia who typically travel to similar destinations as chinese second well work closely with partners to offer onestop travel service globally for example skyscanner and also for example we will continue to work very closely with priceline to offer hotel products throughout the world especially in nonasia region and lastly well invest heavily in technology and innovation and we are open to investing and partnering with technology and travel product leaders in the world our goal is to become most successful travel brand – one of the most successful travel brands in asia and one of the most successful travel companies in the world thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ronald keung please proceed ronald keung  goldman sachs asia llc thank you thank you james jane cindy and cecilia  very strong set of results can you just give us some of the q guidance and outlook on your revenue growth expectation by segment we see very strong gross margins do you think this is sustainable and usually seasonalitywise should we expect gross margins to maintain such strength also the two cost items on sales and marketing that has declined quite a bit and the sharebased compensation has fallen quite a bit and sales and marketing has gone up quite a bit can you just give us some expectations into the next few quarters thank you cindy xiaofan wang  ctripcom international ltd sure thank you so our net revenue will grow at a similar pace moving toward the second quarter of this year our net revenue will grow  to  yearoveryear with respect to the each business line items please note that there is – the following guidance actually included  to  negative vat tax impacted so for the accommodation reservation business we expect to have a  to  yearonyear revenue growth and for the transportation ticketing business we expect to have  to  yearoveryear growth and packaged tour to have  to  and corporate travel will maintain a very solid growth at around  to  yearoveryear growth and ctrip will continue to be very disciplined on the cost side and expected to deliver rmb  million to rmb  billion in the nongaap operating profit you already see we achieved savings in efficiency improvement in almost all expenses line items and the reason why sharebased compensation dropped significantly is because in the first quarter last year ctrip group has a onetime sharebased incentive plan that is the impact and for the sales and marketing expenses yes we always closely monitor each sales and marketing channels in terms of the roi once the roi is positive we will continuously to make investment but moving into this year as james and jane both said we will very decisively to make investment in the second and third tier cities because we see huge potentials in those comparatively lower market thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jed kelly please proceed jed kelly  oppenheimer  co inc great good morning management thank you for taking my question just touching around i guess on the expansion into the lower tier cities can you talk about the roi trends youre seeing in the tier  and tier  cities as you aggressively expand and are you seeing any positive roi in those cities jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd sure thanks jed our approach has always been to start our business with the most profitable segment so ctrip in the past had been very successful starting our business in shanghai beijing guangzhou and shenzhen and the coastal area where the buying power is very strong so ctrip platform probably accumulates the most affluent customers on our platform now going forward the second tier third tier cities the gdp per capita is also growing so we will decisively invest in these areas all these cities represents new markets and new opportunities for us and our strategy are twofold first of all we will extend our product offering into these cities not only in hotels but also in train tickets bus tickets ferry rental car et cetera so our belief is if we provide these comprehensive products for these lower tier cities it will be a very powerful product offering for the customers that will grow into our platform secondly for these cities we have not had invest heavily in our branding in the past now our sales and marketing team are penetrating further into these cities and the results have been very promising the yearoveryear growth in these cities has been threedigits so for these new areas which represents a new market for us we will aggressively make our investment and our guidance has already reflected these investments thank you operator your next question comes from the line of natalie wu please proceed natalie wu wu  cicc hi management thanks for taking my question two quick questions here the first one is about the growth of accommodation service it seems to be accelerated if we compared to the guidance you gave us for the first quarter three months ago versus the second quarter you just mentioned so just wondering what is the reason behind and secondly about the recent cca issue so just wondering will it have any kind of impact on the take rate of your airline ticketing business thank you jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd yes so for the first question because of our investment as james said in the second lower tier cities we see very promising growth in the lower tier cities in the hotel bookings thats one of the reasons why you see kind of acceleration of our growth in those especially in the lower tier markets and your second question is regarding the air tickets right is the take rate of the air ticket natalie wu wu  cicc yes the impact from the cca jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd yeah yes so firstly ctrip uses crossselling practice to facilitate onestop travel experiences and we basically personalized all the crossselling options that had to fit customers requirement based on their historical review and booking history and thats why we see very positive feedback from our customers and we will continuously improve the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate lastly but most importantly customer actually can uncheck any extra services and review their shortlist before or after they check out so as always we will continue to work hard to provide the better value to our customers and as long as we continue to reach customers with the best services to make their travel easier and ctrip remains the most efficient and effective channel for all our suppliers we will be able to keep a reasonable return based on our value proposition thank you natalie wu wu  cicc thanks just to operator your next question comes from the line of wong binnie please proceed binnie wong  bank of america merrill lynch good morning james jane and cindy congratulation on kicking off  with a very solid quarter jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd thank you binnie wong  bank of america merrill lynch so i have two questions here first question – yeah thank you first question is on the operating margin improvement between your core business and your international revenue basically from skyscanner this quarter so what is skyscanner revenue contribution in this quarter i want to understand the margin profile so we can better understand what is it – how much is that improving in our china core business as well so if you can share with us the revenue contribution for skyscanner and also its margin profile that would be very helpful and second is that – a followon on skyscanner is that how is the implementation of the closed loop system is progressing and then a followup on the crossselling activities is that besides the changes we have already seen in your booking platform right and what is – is it already done or any other potential changes we plan to address the announcement by the china consumer association and if we think about say some of these ancillary services on the air ticketing are unchecked by default now how have you seen the conversion rate has changed it and i guess if you can share with us more color on those that would be very helpful thank you jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd yeah thank you binnie our operating margin has been significantly improved because i think most important reason is because our very successful synergies we achieved on all the invested companies including ctrip and qunar brand in terms of skyscanner their total revenue – their revenue contribution to ctrip group is about mid to highsingle digit and their margin profile actually is pretty consistent with ctrips chinese business so regarding the airline crossselling as i said basically ctrip is always very cautious about customers satisfaction and the conversion rate so we keep monitoring the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate and all the customers user behavior what we observed is that our conversion rate and customer satisfaction rate actually continuously to improve so as always we will continue to work very hard to provide the best product products and best most appropriate crossselling product to our customers operator your next question comes from the line of alvin jiang please proceed unknown speaker hi management this is maria  on behalf of alvin jiang so we have two questions here so the first one is can management share the number of head count currently and what is the number of target for the full year jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd the head count of ctrip as a group is about  and we dont expect to add any material head count increase because of the internationalization strategy so we will continuously very actively recruit people with international experiences and as well as for the it persons we will continuously very aggressively recruit more talent in those two areas but overall we dont expect any material head count increase operator your next question come from the line of chi tsang please proceed chi tsang  the hongkong  shanghai banking corp ltd great thank you very much for taking my questions i had a couple of questions in terms of your margins weve seen a very nice pickup in your gross margins this quarter i was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the drivers of that and sort of can we squeeze out more efficiencies on the gross margin side and then secondly if you can reiterate for us sort of your medium to longterm operating margin targets and sort of what markets are we going to see the most leverage from is it from sga – i mean is it from sales and marketing or ga or other areas thanks so much cindy xiaofan wang  ctripcom international ltd yeah so for the gross margin i think the most important reason is because in the last couple of years we invested heavily in the it technologies to automize all the service – backend service offerings from a customers perspective actually if you use ctrip maybe you dont feel any difference between if a customer pick up your phone or we use like a machine to answer your basic questions and to some extent actually we closely monitor for example the nps the customer satisfaction ratios those ratio continuously to improve so this is one of the reasons we kind of bear the fruit from the investment we made in the last couple of years and the second the minor reason is because skyscanners business model they have the metasearch model so their gross margin – they bring us about  to  increase in the gross margin yeah as always we will continuously improve our operational efficiency across all the business lines going forward but i think the  gross margin has already reflected the very scalable business and efficient business models we have so we believe the  would be pretty consistent at least in the next couple of quarters thank you operator your next question comes from the line of justin patterson please proceed justin t patterson  raymond james  associates inc great thank you very much management and congratulations on another strong quarter two if i may first on the makemytrip capital raise you participated in recently could you talk about just what youve learned from being an investor in makemytrip about penetrating the india market and then secondly on skyscanner you mentioned some of your efforts to improve conversion on that platform could you discuss how quickly thats rolling along how quickly you expect that to reach what you were able to achieve with qunar thank you jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd sure for makemytrip we believe the indian market is at the stage where china was  to  years ago and the population is the second largest upcoming to take over as the largest population in the whole world that is why we are very positive in the market although it might take some time so the investment we made in makemytrip is very helpful in terms of knowledge sharing and experience sharing because the two markets have experienced intense competition and there are lot of things that we can share together so we work very closely with the team by sharing our knowledge our product our past experience with them and makemytrip is the dominant – is the largest ota in indian market and we are positive in the future they will grow very well into this faster growing market the second question is skyscanner skyscanner and ctrip are working very closely on the it front to make the direct booking accessible for skyscanners team and our original plan is by the end of the year the first booking will be pushed through but our both it team worked very hard so the first booking was pushed through a few weeks ago much earlier than we expected so were very positive in moving forward to improve the service and users experience on skyscanner by providing the direct booking onto their sites so its moving much smoother and also faster than we originally planned operator your next question comes from the line of alicia yap please proceed alicia yap  citigroup global markets asia ltd hi good morning james jane and cindy thanks for taking my questions i have a followup question on the margin i think cindy you mentioned earlier that skyscanner margins is consistent with the ctrip china margins so i just wonder if the ctrip china margins is lower than the group reported margins so actually excluding skyscanner this quarter the reported margin would have been higher right so just wanted to get that sense and then second is overall on your margins outlook given your continued effort to expand into the global branding and also the lower tier cities just wonder what would be the sales and marketing lines to be and then well skyscanner also have the marketing spend as well to also impact the margins thank you cindy xiaofan wang  ctripcom international ltd yeah ctrip as always – we always continue to – first priority given were still in the very early stage of our development with huge potentials both domestically and internationally so we are in the very early stage our top priority is still to continuously gaining market share firstly in the lower tier city of china and secondly in the international market and so overall speaking even with this top priority given we already have the dominant position especially in the china market we are very confident that our margin will go back to the nongaap  to  level in the next one to two years operator your next question comes from the line of jia long shi please proceed jia long shi  nomura international hong kong ltd hi thanks for taking my question and i have two followups and for the cca investigation i think cindy you mentioned earlier based on your observation the conversion rate actually has continued to improve so i just wonder did you mean the conversion rate for the crossselling service actually continued to improve even after you have made some adjustments recently to your practice of crossselling in response to cca investigation for the skyscanner i understand youre trying to transform skyscanner from a traffic generation model to direct booking model which is similar to your own air ticketing service i just wonder when you talk to those overseas airlines what are their feedback to such a change in skyscanners service model are they cooperative in terms of allowing their passengers to complete the air ticketing booking within skyscanners website instead of those airlines website thank you cindy xiaofan wang  ctripcom international ltd yes we – actually our air ticketing team there working very hard to find the most appropriate and useful product to crossselling together with the air ticket for example the vip lounge service is over  of the customers they choose once – select – will add them to the next shopping which tells you how important and useful those crossselling product is and also we believe ctrip has – in the last couple years we invested heavily in terms of both the pricing as well as the comprehensiveness of our international air ticket so overall speaking we believe as long as we can meet or even to some extent always provide the product that to some extent even exceed some of the customers expectation ctrip has the value proposition to make profit at the most efficient distribution in the air distribution industry and regarding skyscanner yes actually skyscanner they provide marketplaces that offers carriers very strong branding controls through their storefronts whereby carriers can actually easily display their full range of products and at the same time travelers will also enjoy a more similar experience of selecting from a variety of air ticket choices for example the price choices or the seat selections while theyre interacting with the airline  during their bookings after they introduced direct booking so we believe we already see a very positive – or the direct booking engines are very well received by all the airlines operator again ladies and gentlemen for questions were taking questions from analysts and you may ask one question per queue if you have an additional question you may queue back up for questions our next question comes from the line of ming xu please proceed ming xu  ubs securities asia ltd thanks management for taking my question and congratulation on strong quarter also some questions on take rate so first of all can you share with us the current take rate on the hotel side for ctrip and for qunar separately and then given your market share in china and also the – we noticed that hotels operations are also improving recently is there any plan or potential for you to further raise the take rate on the hotel side and we also noticed that you have launched several schemes such as stepup commission rate structure and also the prepaid hotel products are these products going to help you to actually raise your take rate on the hotel side and finally  –  cindy xiaofan wang  ctripcom international ltd thank you so our hotel take rate has been pretty consistent before couponing our growth take rate on the hotel is about  to  but we still keep a certain level of the couponing especially in the lower tier – in the lower end of the market to make sure that we have the most competitive pricing in those markets so the net take rate is about  to  on the hotel side if you then – yes definitely there is room for us to further increase our net take rate on the hotel side but given that for the hotel business both domestically and internationally we are still in the very very early stage we have only singledigit of the total market share in the hotel segment our top priority is to further expand our market share both domestically as well as the international hotel markets so we dont have the plan to increase significantly on the take rate rather we will grow our business mainly driven by the very healthy volume growth on the hotel side operator your next question comes from the line of juan lin please proceed juan lin  research ltd hi good morning james jane and cindy congratulations on another strong quarter i have a followup question on gross margin could you help us to rank the gross margins of your different business lines in particular could you share with us the margin trend for your accommodation booking business as you continue to penetrate into low tier cities and also a quickly followup on the opac your plan is opening  more franchise stores whether you are going to leverage the retail stores of bestone or are these all brand new stores and how will the plan impact the outlook of opac thank you jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd yeah these stores are franchise stores so within one year they will be profitable so the strategic value for them to bring us is coupled with our penetration into the lower tier cities we want to make sure its a full product offering penetrating strongly into the lower tier cities so were not only offering air tickets and hotels the two main products we are also offering packaged tour train bus ferry rental car et cetera with this comprehensive product offering well be able to attract more customers from the lower tier cities so the bestone store in these cities will become a really valuable penetration method in terms of have the firsthand contact with our targeted customers operator your next question comes from the line of tian hou please proceed tian x hou  t h capital llc morning management couple of questions the first one is regarding the transportation its grown really rapidly i would like to gain some details about the contributions from different parts of the transportation in both revenue and volume whats the contribution from the train from the bus from the air in the revenue and volume so that is the question one the number two question jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd within the transportation the reason you see very healthy or rapid growth is firstly because our small business units including the train ticket bus ticket and car services all those small business lines they grow pretty significantly tripledigit growth and in terms of the volumes the train ticket already surpassed the air ticket to become the largest contributor in the transportation ticketing in terms of volumes in terms of a revenue train bus as well as rental car services total contributed about  to  of our total transportation revenues and the other reason is our addition of skyscanner business as you may know skyscanner vast majority of their revenues coming from the air ticket so thats also the reason the transportation ticket has much higher growth rate than other business lines operator your next question comes from the line of alex yao please proceed alex yao  jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question first question is a followup on gross margin so if i understand correctly the reason for gross margin improvement this quarter are twofolds one is that you used more machine to replace labor services in the call center which reduced fixed cost and then second reason is because the skyscanner cost structure difference so i think these two reasons are both structural and that the gross margin should be at least flattish at this level but once we factor in the seasonality that basically suggests that your gross margin will continue to improve in the next few quarters is this a correct statement secondly i want to hear your thoughts on the lower tier investment strategy can you talk about from product offering competitive landscape and the return on investment perspective how do lower tier city differs to the high tier city thank you jane jie sun  ctripcom international ltd sure thanks alex first of all on the margin because we pushed very hard to improve it system the automation robotic technology has taken off in our platform we do have the ability to increase our scalability without adding more people so the scale is there so you are right if we look at our existing portfolio the margin improvements will be very much anticipated however as a fastgrowing company we always want to innovate and penetrate into the new market so we will reserve sufficient funds and the resources to penetrate into the untouched market and the second tier and third tier cities are our target this year so we will use the savings on certain area and use these resources to help us to expand into the new markets in the second tier and third tier cities and your question on investment in new product and roi again we normally start with the most significant products and most significant and profitable markets so the first tier cities ctrip has very strong branding in these areas and second tier cities and coastal areas are also very profitable so we have strong hold in these profitable markets and then we are looking to the new markets and so we penetrate further into the third tier and fourth tier cities these cities are relatively green and also gdp per capita is not reaching our target yet however by taking these new markets and offering comprehensive products into these area along with our sales and marketing expansion we will be able to educate these new customers and grow them into our portfolio going forward and they will become our new customers so the initial investment of the roi will be lower than the matured market but for us these are the new markets were not targeting to make too much money from them but our target is aggressively gain market share and our improved margins will enable us not only to penetrate into these lower tier cities but also show a healthy expansion into the market so our goal are three things first of all aggressive top line growth second expansion and healthy margin third aggressive investment into the new market so we will be able to achieve these three goals simultaneously through the hard work from our it team as well as our service and product teams operator at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to cecilia zhang  please proceed unverified participant thank you to everyone for joining us today you can
