avenue home in  the taproom movement was started in memphis “we thought it was a really important part of our business as a place for people to get to know us” said kellan bartosch cofounder of wiseacre with his brother davin bartosch “our industry is very grassroots we wanted to be able to connect with people when they had questions” that emphasis on connectivity is why there are no tvs in the taproom and it’s the same reason the tables are communal while they never thought the bar would be as busy as it is — which kellan bartosch said is a bonus — wiseacre now offers three event rental options the gemütlichkeit room a small indoor space the chautauqua an outdoor pavilion or the taproom wiseacre is renowned for its own functions such as the annual taste the rarity festival and the recently launched camp chautauqua modeled after a social movement that swept across the us more than a century ago — like an adult summer camp “we don’t think beer is the most important thing in the world but i think it is a component of culture” bartosch said “people who live anywhere want to have a good food scene and a good music scene and a sports team different people are interested in different things i think the taproom was a component that wasn’tthere in memphis when we got started and now people have the opportunity to visit taprooms and different breweries” memphis made brewing

shipping container — was added a year after the taproom opened in response to customer demand the back patio on the building is another memphis made rental option and rentals account for  percent to  percent of the brewery’s monthly revenue “it is kind of the icing on the cake really” ashby said “producing beer and the taproom is a big focus and events is just a little bit of an extra thing — an additional revenue stream” memphis made also holds monthly community concerts and weekly bingo and trivia drew barton president and head brewer for memphis made said they frequently talk about how can
