schöpferische zerstörung sometimes known as schumpeters gale is a concept in economics which since the s has become most readily identified with the austrianamerican economist joseph schumpeter who derived it from the work of karl marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle according to schumpeter the gale of creative destruction describes the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one in marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism the german marxist sociologist werner sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work krieg und kapitalismus war and capitalism  in the earlier work of marx however the idea of creative destruction or annihilation german vernichtung implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth whether through war dereliction or regular and periodic economic crises in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth in capitalism socialism and democracy  joseph schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of marx’s thought to which the whole of part i of the book is devoted arguing in part ii that the creativedestructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system see below despite this the term subsequently gained popularity within neoliberal or freemarket economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company the marxian usage has however been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as david harvey marshall berman manuel castells and daniele archibugi  contents  history  in marxs thought  other early usage  association with joseph schumpeter  examples  later developments  ludwig lachmann  david harvey  marshall berman  manuel castells  daniele archibugi  others  alternative name  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading historyedit in marxs thoughtedit although the modern term creative destruction is not used explicitly by marx it is largely derived from his analyses particularly in the work of werner sombart whom engels described as the only german professor who understood marxs capital and of joseph schumpeter who discussed at length the origin of the idea in marxs work see below in the communist manifesto of  karl marx and friedrich engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of existing production but also of previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions … and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented a few years later in the grundrisse marx was writing of the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation in other words he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which  momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital  violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide in the theories of surplus value volume iv of das kapital  marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of commodity values affects either use values or exchange values or both together the destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the productiondevaluation cycle the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale this is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities it does not cause the destruction of any usevalues what one loses the other gains values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person the old capitalists go bankrupt  a large part of the nominal capital of the society ie of the exchangevalue of the existing capital is once for all destroyed although this very destruction since it does not affect the usevalue may very much expedite the new reproduction this is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest social geographer david harvey sums up the differences between marxs usage of these concepts and schumpeters both karl marx and joseph schumpeter wrote at length on the creativedestructive tendencies inherent in capitalism while marx clearly admired capitalisms creativity he  strongly emphasised its selfdestructiveness the schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalisms endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business other early usageedit in hinduism the god shiva is simultaneously destroyer and creator portrayed as shiva nataraja lord of the dance which is proposed as the source of the western notion of creative destruction in philosophical terms the concept of creative destruction is close to hegel´s concept of sublation in german economic discourse it was taken up from marxs writings by werner sombart particularly in his  text krieg und kapitalismus again however from destruction a new spirit of creation arises the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood forced the use of coal for heating forced the invention of coke for the production of iron hugo reinert has claimed that sombarts formulation of the concept was influenced by eastern mysticism specifically the image of the hindu god shiva who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator conceivably this influence passed from johann gottfried herder who brought hindu thought to german philosophy in his philosophy of human history ideen zur philosophie der geschichte der menschheit herder – specifically volume iii pp – via arthur schopenhauer and the orientalist friedrich maier through friedrich nietzsche´s writings nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of dionysus a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time destructively creative and creatively destructive in the following passage from on the genealogy of morality  nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction such that every creative act has its destructive consequence but have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost how much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered how many lies have had to be sanctified how many consciences disturbed how much god sacrificed every time if a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled – friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morality other nineteenthcentury formulations of this idea include russian anarchist mikhail bakunin who wrote in  the passion for destruction is a creative passion too note however that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed destructive creationoriginal research and differs sharply from marxs and schumpeters formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both marx and schumpeter association with joseph schumpeteredit the expression creative destruction was popularized by and is most associated with joseph schumpeter particularly in his book capitalism socialism and democracy first published in  already in his  book business cycles he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of nikolai kondratieff and his longwave cycle which schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation three years later in capitalism socialism and democracy schumpeter introduced the term creative destruction which he explicitly derived from marxist thought analysed extensively in part i of the book and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation capitalism  is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary  the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates  the opening up of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as us steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one this process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in  capitalism requires the perennial gale of creative destruction in schumpeters vision of capitalism innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological organizational regulatory and economic paradigms however schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalisms own institutional frameworks in breaking down the precapitalist framework of society capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse that process impressive in its relentless necessity was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema  the capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept making it central to his economic theory and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the socalled austrian school of freemarket economic thoughtcitation needed examplesedit polaroid instant cameras have disappeared almost completely with the spread of digital photography schumpeter  in one of his examples used the railroadization of the middle west as it was initiated by the illinois central he wrote the illinois central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated but it spelled the death sentence for the old agriculture of the west companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example xerox in copiers or polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs in technology the cassette tape replaced the track only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc which was undercut by downloads to mp players which is now being usurped by webbased streaming services companies which made money out of technology which becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies one such example is the way in which online adsupported news sites such as the huffington post are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper the christian science monitor announced in january  that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition the seattle postintelligencer became onlineonly in march  at a national level in usa employment in the newspaper business fell from  in  to  in  over that same period employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from  to  traditional french alumni networks which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as linkedin and viadeo in fact successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power eroding the profits and position of old firms yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market and back again it has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics david ames wells  who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late th century gave many examples of creative destruction without using the term brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency shipping the international telegraph network and agricultural mechanization later developmentsedit ludwig lachmannedit these economic facts have certain social consequences as the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on social grounds it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process we have already spoken of it as a leveling process more aptly we may now describe these results as an instance of what pareto called the circulation of elites wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands it passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value now on this now on that specific resource engendering capital gains and losses the owners of wealth we might say with schumpeter are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train they are always there but are never for long the same people — ludwig lachmann the market economy and the distribution of wealth david harveyedit geographer and historian david harvey in a series of works from the s onwards social justice and the city  the limits to capital  the urbanization of capital  spaces of hope  spaces of capital  spaces of neoliberalization  the enigma of capital and the crises of capitalism  elaborated marxs thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment and to the production of space more broadly he developed the notion that capitalism finds a spatial fix for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure buildings etc the built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus while the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement it can also constitute a limit in its own right as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form as capital cannot abide a limit to profitability ever more frantic forms of timespace compression increased speed of turnover innovation of ever faster transport and communications infrastructure flexible accumulation ensue often impelling technological innovation such innovation however is a doubleedged sword the effect of continuous innovation  is to devalue if not destroy past investments and labour skills creative destruction is embedded within the circulation of capital itself innovation exacerbates instability insecurity and in the end becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis  the struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities new product lines are opened up and that means the creation of new wants and needs capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others  the result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another leaving whole sectors devastated  the drive to relocate to more advantageous places the geographical movement of both capital and labour periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity the resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to the twinkling of an eye globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of timespace compression allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations hence in this continual process of creative destruction capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises but merely moves them around geographically marshall bermanedit in his  book all that is solid melts into air the experience of modernity particularly in the chapter entitled innovative selfdestruction pp – marshall berman provides a reading of marxist creative destruction to explain key processes at work within modernity the title of the book is taken from a wellknown passage from the communist manifesto berman elaborates this into something of a zeitgeist which has profound social and cultural consequences the truth of the matter as marx sees is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down all that is solid—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them to the men and women who work the machines to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved so they can be recycled or replaced next week and the whole process can go on again and again hopefully forever in ever more profitable forms the pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts gothic cathedrals here berman emphasizes marxs perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalisms immense creative forces and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity manuel castellsedit the sociologist manuel castells in his trilogy on the information age economy society and culture the first volume of which the rise of the network society appeared in  reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe while divesting from others using the new paradigm of informational networks in the era of globalization capitalism is characterized by nearinstantaneous flow creating a new spatial dimension the space of flows while technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks indeed the new spatial form of the megacity or megalopolis is defined by castells as having the contradictory quality of being globally connected and locally disconnected physically and socially castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction the spirit of informationalism is the culture of creative destruction accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals schumpeter meets weber in the cyberspace of the network enterprise daniele archibugiedit developing the schumpeterian legacy the school of the science policy research unit of the university of sussex has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring in particular how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change chris freeman and carlota perez have developed these insights more recently daniele archibugi and andrea filippetti have associated the  economic crisis to the slowdown of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies icts using as a metaphor the film blade runner archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in  all those associated to icts have become part of our everyday life but on the contrary none of those in the field of biotech have been fully commercialized a new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices we should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology icts have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life they have generated jobs and profits but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life why have these not yet been delivered what can be done to unleash their potential there are a few basic questions that need to be addressed othersedit in  the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by philippe aghion and peter howitt giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to paul romers expanding varieties model in  harvard business school authors richard l nolan and david c croson released creative destruction a sixstage process for transforming the organization the book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage more recently the idea of creative destruction was utilized by max page in his  book the creative destruction of manhattan – the book traces manhattans constant reinvention often at the expense of preserving a concrete past describing this process as creative destruction page describes the complex historical circumstances economics social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in manhattans cityscape in addition to max page others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization tc chang and shirlena huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper recreating place replacing memory creative destruction at the singapore river the authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region rosemary wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central paris france known as les halles les halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century ultimately in  the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down in their place now stand a hub for trains subways and buses les halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in france and the controversial centre georges pompidou the term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts alan ackerman and martin puncher  edited a collection of essays under the title against theater creative destruction on the modernist stage they detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics they speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of antitheatricality straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions which might be considered avantgarde staging techniques in his  book still the new world american literature in a culture of creative destruction philip fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century including the works of such authors as ralph waldo emerson walt whitman herman melville mark twain and henry james among others fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology neoconservative author michael ledeen argued in his  book the war against the terror masters that america is a revolutionary nation undoing traditional societies creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law his characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development the connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by stuart l hart and mark b milstein in their  article global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability an argument which they would later on strengthen in their  article creating sustainable value and in  with innovation creative destruction and sustainability andrea l larson agreed with this vision a year later in sustainable innovation through an entrepreneurship lens stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive

raya dunayevskaya herbert marcuse maximilien rubel guy debord socialism portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e creative destruction german schöpferische zerstörung sometimes known as schumpeters gale is a concept in economics which since the s has become most readily identified with the austrianamerican economist joseph schumpeter who derived it from the work of karl marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle according to schumpeter the gale of creative destruction describes the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one in marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism the german marxist sociologist werner sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work krieg und kapitalismus war and capitalism  in the earlier work of marx however the idea of creative destruction or annihilation german vernichtung implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth whether through war dereliction or regular and periodic economic crises in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth in capitalism socialism and democracy  joseph schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of marx’s thought to which the whole of part i of the book is devoted arguing in part ii that the creativedestructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system see below despite this the term subsequently gained popularity within neoliberal or freemarket economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company the marxian usage has however been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as david harvey marshall berman manuel castells and daniele archibugi  contents  history  in marxs thought  other early usage  association with joseph schumpeter  examples  later developments  ludwig lachmann  david harvey  marshall berman  manuel castells  daniele archibugi  others  alternative name  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading historyedit in marxs thoughtedit although the modern term creative destruction is not used explicitly by marx it is largely derived from his analyses particularly in the work of werner sombart whom engels described as the only german professor who understood marxs capital and of joseph schumpeter who discussed at length the origin of the idea in marxs work see below in the communist manifesto of  karl marx and friedrich engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of existing production but also of previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions … and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented a few years later in the grundrisse marx was writing of the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation in other words he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which  momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital  violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide in the theories of surplus value volume iv of das kapital  marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of commodity values affects either use values or exchange values or both together the destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the productiondevaluation cycle the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale this is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities it does not cause the destruction of any usevalues what one loses the other gains values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person the old capitalists go bankrupt  a large part of the nominal capital of the society ie of the exchangevalue of the existing capital is once for all destroyed although this very destruction since it does not affect the usevalue may very much expedite the new reproduction this is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest social geographer david harvey sums up the differences between marxs usage of these concepts and schumpeters both karl marx and joseph schumpeter wrote at length on the creativedestructive tendencies inherent in capitalism while marx clearly admired capitalisms creativity he  strongly emphasised its selfdestructiveness the schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalisms endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business other early usageedit in hinduism the god shiva is simultaneously destroyer and creator portrayed as shiva nataraja lord of the dance which is proposed as the source of the western notion of creative destruction in philosophical terms the concept of creative destruction is close to hegel´s concept of sublation in german economic discourse it was taken up from marxs writings by werner sombart particularly in his  text krieg und kapitalismus again however from destruction a new spirit of creation arises the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood forced the use of coal for heating forced the invention of coke for the production of iron hugo reinert has claimed that sombarts formulation of the concept was influenced by eastern mysticism specifically the image of the hindu god shiva who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator conceivably this influence passed from johann gottfried herder who brought hindu thought to german philosophy in his philosophy of human history ideen zur philosophie der geschichte der menschheit herder – specifically volume iii pp – via arthur schopenhauer and the orientalist friedrich maier through friedrich nietzsche´s writings nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of dionysus a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time destructively creative and creatively destructive in the following passage from on the genealogy of morality  nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction such that every creative act has its destructive consequence but have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost how much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered how many lies have had to be sanctified how many consciences disturbed how much god sacrificed every time if a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled – friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morality other nineteenthcentury formulations of this idea include russian anarchist mikhail bakunin who wrote in  the passion for destruction is a creative passion too note however that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed destructive creationoriginal research and differs sharply from marxs and schumpeters formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both marx and schumpeter association with joseph schumpeteredit the expression creative destruction was popularized by and is most associated with joseph schumpeter particularly in his book capitalism socialism and democracy first published in  already in his  book business cycles he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of nikolai kondratieff and his longwave cycle which schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation three years later in capitalism socialism and democracy schumpeter introduced the term creative destruction which he explicitly derived from marxist thought analysed extensively in part i of the book and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation capitalism  is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary  the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates  the opening up of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as us steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one this process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in  capitalism requires the perennial gale of creative destruction in schumpeters vision of capitalism innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological organizational regulatory and economic paradigms however schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalisms own institutional frameworks in breaking down the precapitalist framework of society capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse that process impressive in its relentless necessity was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema  the capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept making it central to his economic theory and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the socalled austrian school of freemarket economic thoughtcitation needed examplesedit polaroid instant cameras have disappeared almost completely with the spread of digital photography schumpeter  in one of his examples used the railroadization of the middle west as it was initiated by the illinois central he wrote the illinois central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated but it spelled the death sentence for the old agriculture of the west companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example xerox in copiers or polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs in technology the cassette tape replaced the track only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc which was undercut by downloads to mp players which is now being usurped by webbased streaming services companies which made money out of technology which becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies one such example is the way in which online adsupported news sites such as the huffington post are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper the christian science monitor announced in january  that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition the seattle postintelligencer became onlineonly in march  at a national level in usa employment in the newspaper business fell from  in  to  in  over that same period employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from  to  traditional french alumni networks which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as linkedin and viadeo in fact successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power eroding the profits and position of old firms yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market and back again it has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics david ames wells  who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late th century gave many examples of creative destruction without using the term brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency shipping the international telegraph network and agricultural mechanization later developmentsedit ludwig lachmannedit these economic facts have certain social consequences as the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on social grounds it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process we have already spoken of it as a leveling process more aptly we may now describe these results as an instance of what pareto called the circulation of elites wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands it passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value now on this now on that specific resource engendering capital gains and losses the owners of wealth we might say with schumpeter are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train they are always there but are never for long the same people — ludwig lachmann the market economy and the distribution of wealth david harveyedit geographer and historian david harvey in a series of works from the s onwards social justice and the city  the limits to capital  the urbanization of capital  spaces of hope  spaces of capital  spaces of neoliberalization  the enigma of capital and the crises of capitalism  elaborated marxs thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment and to the production of space more broadly he developed the notion that capitalism finds a spatial fix for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure buildings etc the built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus while the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement it can also constitute a limit in its own right as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form as capital cannot abide a limit to profitability ever more frantic forms of timespace compression increased speed of turnover innovation of ever faster transport and communications infrastructure flexible accumulation ensue often impelling technological innovation such innovation however is a doubleedged sword the effect of continuous innovation  is to devalue if not destroy past investments and labour skills creative destruction is embedded within the circulation of capital itself innovation exacerbates instability insecurity and in the end becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis  the struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities new product lines are opened up and that means the creation of new wants and needs capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others  the result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another leaving whole sectors devastated  the drive to relocate to more advantageous places the geographical movement of both capital and labour periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity the resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to the twinkling of an eye globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of timespace compression allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations hence in this continual process of creative destruction capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises but merely moves them around geographically marshall bermanedit in his  book all that is solid melts into air the experience of modernity particularly in the chapter entitled innovative selfdestruction pp – marshall berman provides a reading of marxist creative destruction to explain key processes at work within modernity the title of the book is taken from a wellknown passage from the communist manifesto berman elaborates this into something of a zeitgeist which has profound social and cultural consequences the truth of the matter as marx sees is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down all that is solid—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them to the men and women who work the machines to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved so they can be recycled or replaced next week and the whole process can go on again and again hopefully forever in ever more profitable forms the pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts gothic cathedrals here berman emphasizes marxs perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalisms immense creative forces and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity manuel castellsedit the sociologist manuel castells in his trilogy on the information age economy society and culture the first volume of which the rise of the network society appeared in  reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe while divesting from others using the new paradigm of informational networks in the era of globalization capitalism is characterized by nearinstantaneous flow creating a new spatial dimension the space of flows while technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks indeed the new spatial form of the megacity or megalopolis is defined by castells as having the contradictory quality of being globally connected and locally disconnected physically and socially castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction the spirit of informationalism is the culture of creative destruction accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals schumpeter meets weber in the cyberspace of the network enterprise daniele archibugiedit developing the schumpeterian legacy the school of the science policy research unit of the university of sussex has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring in particular how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change chris freeman and carlota perez have developed these insights more recently daniele archibugi and andrea filippetti have associated the  economic crisis to the slowdown of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies icts using as a metaphor the film blade runner archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in  all those associated to icts have become part of our everyday life but on the contrary none of those in the field of biotech have been fully commercialized a new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices we should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology icts have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life they have generated jobs and profits but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life why have these not yet been delivered what can be done to unleash their potential there are a few basic questions that need to be addressed othersedit in  the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by philippe aghion and peter howitt giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to paul romers expanding varieties model in  harvard business school authors richard l nolan and david c croson released creative destruction a sixstage process for transforming the organization the book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage more recently the idea of creative destruction was utilized by max page in his  book the creative destruction of manhattan – the book traces manhattans constant reinvention often at the expense of preserving a concrete past describing this process as creative destruction page describes the complex historical circumstances economics social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in manhattans cityscape in addition to max page others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization tc chang and shirlena huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper recreating place replacing memory creative destruction at the singapore river the authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region rosemary wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central paris france known as les halles les halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century ultimately in  the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down in their place now stand a hub for trains subways and buses les halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in france and the controversial centre georges pompidou the term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts alan ackerman and martin puncher  edited a collection of essays under the title against theater creative destruction on the modernist stage they detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics they speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of antitheatricality straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions which might be considered avantgarde staging techniques in his  book still the new world american literature in a culture of creative destruction philip fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century including the works of such authors as ralph waldo emerson walt whitman herman melville mark twain and henry james among others fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology neoconservative author michael ledeen argued in his  book the war against the terror masters that america is a revolutionary nation undoing traditional societies creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law his characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development the connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by stuart l hart and mark b milstein in their  article global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability an argument which they would later on strengthen in their  article creating sustainable value and in  with innovation creative destruction and sustainability andrea l larson agreed with this vision a year later in sustainable innovation through an entrepreneurship lens stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive

raya dunayevskaya herbert marcuse maximilien rubel guy debord socialism portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e creative destruction german schöpferische zerstörung sometimes known as schumpeters gale is a concept in economics which since the s has become most readily identified with the austrianamerican economist joseph schumpeter who derived it from the work of karl marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle according to schumpeter the gale of creative destruction describes the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one in marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism the german marxist sociologist werner sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work krieg und kapitalismus war and capitalism  in the earlier work of marx however the idea of creative destruction or annihilation german vernichtung implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth whether through war dereliction or regular and periodic economic crises in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth in capitalism socialism and democracy  joseph schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of marx’s thought to which the whole of part i of the book is devoted arguing in part ii that the creativedestructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system see below despite this the term subsequently gained popularity within neoliberal or freemarket economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company the marxian usage has however been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as david harvey marshall berman manuel castells and daniele archibugi  contents  history  in marxs thought  other early usage  association with joseph schumpeter  examples  later developments  ludwig lachmann  david harvey  marshall berman  manuel castells  daniele archibugi  others  alternative name  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading historyedit in marxs thoughtedit although the modern term creative destruction is not used explicitly by marx it is largely derived from his analyses particularly in the work of werner sombart whom engels described as the only german professor who understood marxs capital and of joseph schumpeter who discussed at length the origin of the idea in marxs work see below in the communist manifesto of  karl marx and friedrich engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of existing production but also of previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions … and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented a few years later in the grundrisse marx was writing of the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation in other words he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which  momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital  violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide in the theories of surplus value volume iv of das kapital  marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of commodity values affects either use values or exchange values or both together the destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the productiondevaluation cycle the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale this is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities it does not cause the destruction of any usevalues what one loses the other gains values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person the old capitalists go bankrupt  a large part of the nominal capital of the society ie of the exchangevalue of the existing capital is once for all destroyed although this very destruction since it does not affect the usevalue may very much expedite the new reproduction this is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest social geographer david harvey sums up the differences between marxs usage of these concepts and schumpeters both karl marx and joseph schumpeter wrote at length on the creativedestructive tendencies inherent in capitalism while marx clearly admired capitalisms creativity he  strongly emphasised its selfdestructiveness the schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalisms endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business other early usageedit in hinduism the god shiva is simultaneously destroyer and creator portrayed as shiva nataraja lord of the dance which is proposed as the source of the western notion of creative destruction in philosophical terms the concept of creative destruction is close to hegel´s concept of sublation in german economic discourse it was taken up from marxs writings by werner sombart particularly in his  text krieg und kapitalismus again however from destruction a new spirit of creation arises the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood forced the use of coal for heating forced the invention of coke for the production of iron hugo reinert has claimed that sombarts formulation of the concept was influenced by eastern mysticism specifically the image of the hindu god shiva who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator conceivably this influence passed from johann gottfried herder who brought hindu thought to german philosophy in his philosophy of human history ideen zur philosophie der geschichte der menschheit herder – specifically volume iii pp – via arthur schopenhauer and the orientalist friedrich maier through friedrich nietzsche´s writings nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of dionysus a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time destructively creative and creatively destructive in the following passage from on the genealogy of morality  nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction such that every creative act has its destructive consequence but have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost how much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered how many lies have had to be sanctified how many consciences disturbed how much god sacrificed every time if a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled – friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morality other nineteenthcentury formulations of this idea include russian anarchist mikhail bakunin who wrote in  the passion for destruction is a creative passion too note however that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed destructive creationoriginal research and differs sharply from marxs and schumpeters formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both marx and schumpeter association with joseph schumpeteredit the expression creative destruction was popularized by and is most associated with joseph schumpeter particularly in his book capitalism socialism and democracy first published in  already in his  book business cycles he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of nikolai kondratieff and his longwave cycle which schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation three years later in capitalism socialism and democracy schumpeter introduced the term creative destruction which he explicitly derived from marxist thought analysed extensively in part i of the book and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation capitalism  is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary  the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates  the opening up of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as us steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one this process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in  capitalism requires the perennial gale of creative destruction in schumpeters vision of capitalism innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological organizational regulatory and economic paradigms however schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalisms own institutional frameworks in breaking down the precapitalist framework of society capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse that process impressive in its relentless necessity was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema  the capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept making it central to his economic theory and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the socalled austrian school of freemarket economic thoughtcitation needed examplesedit polaroid instant cameras have disappeared almost completely with the spread of digital photography schumpeter  in one of his examples used the railroadization of the middle west as it was initiated by the illinois central he wrote the illinois central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated but it spelled the death sentence for the old agriculture of the west companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example xerox in copiers or polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs in technology the cassette tape replaced the track only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc which was undercut by downloads to mp players which is now being usurped by webbased streaming services companies which made money out of technology which becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies one such example is the way in which online adsupported news sites such as the huffington post are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper the christian science monitor announced in january  that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition the seattle postintelligencer became onlineonly in march  at a national level in usa employment in the newspaper business fell from  in  to  in  over that same period employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from  to  traditional french alumni networks which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as linkedin and viadeo in fact successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power eroding the profits and position of old firms yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market and back again it has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics david ames wells  who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late th century gave many examples of creative destruction without using the term brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency shipping the international telegraph network and agricultural mechanization later developmentsedit ludwig lachmannedit these economic facts have certain social consequences as the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on social grounds it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process we have already spoken of it as a leveling process more aptly we may now describe these results as an instance of what pareto called the circulation of elites wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands it passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value now on this now on that specific resource engendering capital gains and losses the owners of wealth we might say with schumpeter are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train they are always there but are never for long the same people — ludwig lachmann the market economy and the distribution of wealth david harveyedit geographer and historian david harvey in a series of works from the s onwards social justice and the city  the limits to capital  the urbanization of capital  spaces of hope  spaces of capital  spaces of neoliberalization  the enigma of capital and the crises of capitalism  elaborated marxs thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment and to the production of space more broadly he developed the notion that capitalism finds a spatial fix for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure buildings etc the built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus while the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement it can also constitute a limit in its own right as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form as capital cannot abide a limit to profitability ever more frantic forms of timespace compression increased speed of turnover innovation of ever faster transport and communications infrastructure flexible accumulation ensue often impelling technological innovation such innovation however is a doubleedged sword the effect of continuous innovation  is to devalue if not destroy past investments and labour skills creative destruction is embedded within the circulation of capital itself innovation exacerbates instability insecurity and in the end becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis  the struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities new product lines are opened up and that means the creation of new wants and needs capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others  the result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another leaving whole sectors devastated  the drive to relocate to more advantageous places the geographical movement of both capital and labour periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity the resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to the twinkling of an eye globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of timespace compression allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations hence in this continual process of creative destruction capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises but merely moves them around geographically marshall bermanedit in his  book all that is solid melts into air the experience of modernity particularly in the chapter entitled innovative selfdestruction pp – marshall berman provides a reading of marxist creative destruction to explain key processes at work within modernity the title of the book is taken from a wellknown passage from the communist manifesto berman elaborates this into something of a zeitgeist which has profound social and cultural consequences the truth of the matter as marx sees is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down all that is solid—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them to the men and women who work the machines to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved so they can be recycled or replaced next week and the whole process can go on again and again hopefully forever in ever more profitable forms the pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts gothic cathedrals here berman emphasizes marxs perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalisms immense creative forces and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity manuel castellsedit the sociologist manuel castells in his trilogy on the information age economy society and culture the first volume of which the rise of the network society appeared in  reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe while divesting from others using the new paradigm of informational networks in the era of globalization capitalism is characterized by nearinstantaneous flow creating a new spatial dimension the space of flows while technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks indeed the new spatial form of the megacity or megalopolis is defined by castells as having the contradictory quality of being globally connected and locally disconnected physically and socially castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction the spirit of informationalism is the culture of creative destruction accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals schumpeter meets weber in the cyberspace of the network enterprise daniele archibugiedit developing the schumpeterian legacy the school of the science policy research unit of the university of sussex has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring in particular how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change chris freeman and carlota perez have developed these insights more recently daniele archibugi and andrea filippetti have associated the  economic crisis to the slowdown of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies icts using as a metaphor the film blade runner archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in  all those associated to icts have become part of our everyday life but on the contrary none of those in the field of biotech have been fully commercialized a new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices we should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology icts have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life they have generated jobs and profits but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life why have these not yet been delivered what can be done to unleash their potential there are a few basic questions that need to be addressed othersedit in  the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by philippe aghion and peter howitt giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to paul romers expanding varieties model in  harvard business school authors richard l nolan and david c croson released creative destruction a sixstage process for transforming the organization the book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage more recently the idea of creative destruction was utilized by max page in his  book the creative destruction of manhattan – the book traces manhattans constant reinvention often at the expense of preserving a concrete past describing this process as creative destruction page describes the complex historical circumstances economics social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in manhattans cityscape in addition to max page others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization tc chang and shirlena huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper recreating place replacing memory creative destruction at the singapore river the authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region rosemary wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central paris france known as les halles les halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century ultimately in  the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down in their place now stand a hub for trains subways and buses les halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in france and the controversial centre georges pompidou the term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts alan ackerman and martin puncher  edited a collection of essays under the title against theater creative destruction on the modernist stage they detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics they speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of antitheatricality straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions which might be considered avantgarde staging techniques in his  book still the new world american literature in a culture of creative destruction philip fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century including the works of such authors as ralph waldo emerson walt whitman herman melville mark twain and henry james among others fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology neoconservative author michael ledeen argued in his  book the war against the terror masters that america is a revolutionary nation undoing traditional societies creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law his characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development the connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by stuart l hart and mark b milstein in their  article global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability an argument which they would later on strengthen in their  article creating sustainable value and in  with innovation creative destruction and sustainability andrea l larson agreed with this vision a year later in sustainable innovation through an entrepreneurship lens stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive

raya dunayevskaya herbert marcuse maximilien rubel guy debord socialism portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e creative destruction german schöpferische zerstörung sometimes known as schumpeters gale is a concept in economics which since the s has become most readily identified with the austrianamerican economist joseph schumpeter who derived it from the work of karl marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle according to schumpeter the gale of creative destruction describes the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one in marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism the german marxist sociologist werner sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work krieg und kapitalismus war and capitalism  in the earlier work of marx however the idea of creative destruction or annihilation german vernichtung implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth whether through war dereliction or regular and periodic economic crises in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth in capitalism socialism and democracy  joseph schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of marx’s thought to which the whole of part i of the book is devoted arguing in part ii that the creativedestructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system see below despite this the term subsequently gained popularity within neoliberal or freemarket economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company the marxian usage has however been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as david harvey marshall berman manuel castells and daniele archibugi  contents  history  in marxs thought  other early usage  association with joseph schumpeter  examples  later developments  ludwig lachmann  david harvey  marshall berman  manuel castells  daniele archibugi  others  alternative name  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading historyedit in marxs thoughtedit although the modern term creative destruction is not used explicitly by marx it is largely derived from his analyses particularly in the work of werner sombart whom engels described as the only german professor who understood marxs capital and of joseph schumpeter who discussed at length the origin of the idea in marxs work see below in the communist manifesto of  karl marx and friedrich engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of existing production but also of previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions … and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented a few years later in the grundrisse marx was writing of the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation in other words he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which  momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital  violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide in the theories of surplus value volume iv of das kapital  marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of commodity values affects either use values or exchange values or both together the destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the productiondevaluation cycle the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale this is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities it does not cause the destruction of any usevalues what one loses the other gains values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person the old capitalists go bankrupt  a large part of the nominal capital of the society ie of the exchangevalue of the existing capital is once for all destroyed although this very destruction since it does not affect the usevalue may very much expedite the new reproduction this is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest social geographer david harvey sums up the differences between marxs usage of these concepts and schumpeters both karl marx and joseph schumpeter wrote at length on the creativedestructive tendencies inherent in capitalism while marx clearly admired capitalisms creativity he  strongly emphasised its selfdestructiveness the schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalisms endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business other early usageedit in hinduism the god shiva is simultaneously destroyer and creator portrayed as shiva nataraja lord of the dance which is proposed as the source of the western notion of creative destruction in philosophical terms the concept of creative destruction is close to hegel´s concept of sublation in german economic discourse it was taken up from marxs writings by werner sombart particularly in his  text krieg und kapitalismus again however from destruction a new spirit of creation arises the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood forced the use of coal for heating forced the invention of coke for the production of iron hugo reinert has claimed that sombarts formulation of the concept was influenced by eastern mysticism specifically the image of the hindu god shiva who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator conceivably this influence passed from johann gottfried herder who brought hindu thought to german philosophy in his philosophy of human history ideen zur philosophie der geschichte der menschheit herder – specifically volume iii pp – via arthur schopenhauer and the orientalist friedrich maier through friedrich nietzsche´s writings nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of dionysus a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time destructively creative and creatively destructive in the following passage from on the genealogy of morality  nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction such that every creative act has its destructive consequence but have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost how much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered how many lies have had to be sanctified how many consciences disturbed how much god sacrificed every time if a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled – friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morality other nineteenthcentury formulations of this idea include russian anarchist mikhail bakunin who wrote in  the passion for destruction is a creative passion too note however that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed destructive creationoriginal research and differs sharply from marxs and schumpeters formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both marx and schumpeter association with joseph schumpeteredit the expression creative destruction was popularized by and is most associated with joseph schumpeter particularly in his book capitalism socialism and democracy first published in  already in his  book business cycles he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of nikolai kondratieff and his longwave cycle which schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation three years later in capitalism socialism and democracy schumpeter introduced the term creative destruction which he explicitly derived from marxist thought analysed extensively in part i of the book and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation capitalism  is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary  the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates  the opening up of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as us steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one this process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in  capitalism requires the perennial gale of creative destruction in schumpeters vision of capitalism innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological organizational regulatory and economic paradigms however schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalisms own institutional frameworks in breaking down the precapitalist framework of society capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse that process impressive in its relentless necessity was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema  the capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept making it central to his economic theory and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the socalled austrian school of freemarket economic thoughtcitation needed examplesedit polaroid instant cameras have disappeared almost completely with the spread of digital photography schumpeter  in one of his examples used the railroadization of the middle west as it was initiated by the illinois central he wrote the illinois central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated but it spelled the death sentence for the old agriculture of the west companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example xerox in copiers or polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs in technology the cassette tape replaced the track only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc which was undercut by downloads to mp players which is now being usurped by webbased streaming services companies which made money out of technology which becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies one such example is the way in which online adsupported news sites such as the huffington post are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper the christian science monitor announced in january  that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition the seattle postintelligencer became onlineonly in march  at a national level in usa employment in the newspaper business fell from  in  to  in  over that same period employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from  to  traditional french alumni networks which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as linkedin and viadeo in fact successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power eroding the profits and position of old firms yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market and back again it has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics david ames wells  who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late th century gave many examples of creative destruction without using the term brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency shipping the international telegraph network and agricultural mechanization later developmentsedit ludwig lachmannedit these economic facts have certain social consequences as the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on social grounds it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process we have already spoken of it as a leveling process more aptly we may now describe these results as an instance of what pareto called the circulation of elites wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands it passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value now on this now on that specific resource engendering capital gains and losses the owners of wealth we might say with schumpeter are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train they are always there but are never for long the same people — ludwig lachmann the market economy and the distribution of wealth david harveyedit geographer and historian david harvey in a series of works from the s onwards social justice and the city  the limits to capital  the urbanization of capital  spaces of hope  spaces of capital  spaces of neoliberalization  the enigma of capital and the crises of capitalism  elaborated marxs thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment and to the production of space more broadly he developed the notion that capitalism finds a spatial fix for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure buildings etc the built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus while the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement it can also constitute a limit in its own right as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form as capital cannot abide a limit to profitability ever more frantic forms of timespace compression increased speed of turnover innovation of ever faster transport and communications infrastructure flexible accumulation ensue often impelling technological innovation such innovation however is a doubleedged sword the effect of continuous innovation  is to devalue if not destroy past investments and labour skills creative destruction is embedded within the circulation of capital itself innovation exacerbates instability insecurity and in the end becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis  the struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities new product lines are opened up and that means the creation of new wants and needs capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others  the result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another leaving whole sectors devastated  the drive to relocate to more advantageous places the geographical movement of both capital and labour periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity the resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to the twinkling of an eye globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of timespace compression allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations hence in this continual process of creative destruction capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises but merely moves them around geographically marshall bermanedit in his  book all that is solid melts into air the experience of modernity particularly in the chapter entitled innovative selfdestruction pp – marshall berman provides a reading of marxist creative destruction to explain key processes at work within modernity the title of the book is taken from a wellknown passage from the communist manifesto berman elaborates this into something of a zeitgeist which has profound social and cultural consequences the truth of the matter as marx sees is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down all that is solid—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them to the men and women who work the machines to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved so they can be recycled or replaced next week and the whole process can go on again and again hopefully forever in ever more profitable forms the pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts gothic cathedrals here berman emphasizes marxs perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalisms immense creative forces and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity manuel castellsedit the sociologist manuel castells in his trilogy on the information age economy society and culture the first volume of which the rise of the network society appeared in  reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe while divesting from others using the new paradigm of informational networks in the era of globalization capitalism is characterized by nearinstantaneous flow creating a new spatial dimension the space of flows while technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks indeed the new spatial form of the megacity or megalopolis is defined by castells as having the contradictory quality of being globally connected and locally disconnected physically and socially castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction the spirit of informationalism is the culture of creative destruction accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals schumpeter meets weber in the cyberspace of the network enterprise daniele archibugiedit developing the schumpeterian legacy the school of the science policy research unit of the university of sussex has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring in particular how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change chris freeman and carlota perez have developed these insights more recently daniele archibugi and andrea filippetti have associated the  economic crisis to the slowdown of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies icts using as a metaphor the film blade runner archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in  all those associated to icts have become part of our everyday life but on the contrary none of those in the field of biotech have been fully commercialized a new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices we should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology icts have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life they have generated jobs and profits but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life why have these not yet been delivered what can be done to unleash their potential there are a few basic questions that need to be addressed othersedit in  the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by philippe aghion and peter howitt giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to paul romers expanding varieties model in  harvard business school authors richard l nolan and david c croson released creative destruction a sixstage process for transforming the organization the book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage more recently the idea of creative destruction was utilized by max page in his  book the creative destruction of manhattan – the book traces manhattans constant reinvention often at the expense of preserving a concrete past describing this process as creative destruction page describes the complex historical circumstances economics social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in manhattans cityscape in addition to max page others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization tc chang and shirlena huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper recreating place replacing memory creative destruction at the singapore river the authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region rosemary wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central paris france known as les halles les halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century ultimately in  the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down in their place now stand a hub for trains subways and buses les halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in france and the controversial centre georges pompidou the term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts alan ackerman and martin puncher  edited a collection of essays under the title against theater creative destruction on the modernist stage they detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics they speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of antitheatricality straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions which might be considered avantgarde staging techniques in his  book still the new world american literature in a culture of creative destruction philip fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century including the works of such authors as ralph waldo emerson walt whitman herman melville mark twain and henry james among others fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology neoconservative author michael ledeen argued in his  book the war against the terror masters that america is a revolutionary nation undoing traditional societies creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law his characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development the connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by stuart l hart and mark b milstein in their  article global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability an argument which they would later on strengthen in their  article creating sustainable value and in  with innovation creative destruction and sustainability andrea l larson agreed with this vision a year later in sustainable innovation through an entrepreneurship lens stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive

raya dunayevskaya herbert marcuse maximilien rubel guy debord socialism portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e creative destruction german schöpferische zerstörung sometimes known as schumpeters gale is a concept in economics which since the s has become most readily identified with the austrianamerican economist joseph schumpeter who derived it from the work of karl marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle according to schumpeter the gale of creative destruction describes the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one in marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism the german marxist sociologist werner sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work krieg und kapitalismus war and capitalism  in the earlier work of marx however the idea of creative destruction or annihilation german vernichtung implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth whether through war dereliction or regular and periodic economic crises in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth in capitalism socialism and democracy  joseph schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of marx’s thought to which the whole of part i of the book is devoted arguing in part ii that the creativedestructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system see below despite this the term subsequently gained popularity within neoliberal or freemarket economics as a description of processes such as downsizing in order to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company the marxian usage has however been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as david harvey marshall berman manuel castells and daniele archibugi  contents  history  in marxs thought  other early usage  association with joseph schumpeter  examples  later developments  ludwig lachmann  david harvey  marshall berman  manuel castells  daniele archibugi  others  alternative name  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading historyedit in marxs thoughtedit although the modern term creative destruction is not used explicitly by marx it is largely derived from his analyses particularly in the work of werner sombart whom engels described as the only german professor who understood marxs capital and of joseph schumpeter who discussed at length the origin of the idea in marxs work see below in the communist manifesto of  karl marx and friedrich engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells  it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of existing production but also of previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions … and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented a few years later in the grundrisse marx was writing of the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation in other words he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which  momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital  violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide in the theories of surplus value volume iv of das kapital  marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of commodity values affects either use values or exchange values or both together the destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the productiondevaluation cycle the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale this is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities it does not cause the destruction of any usevalues what one loses the other gains values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person the old capitalists go bankrupt  a large part of the nominal capital of the society ie of the exchangevalue of the existing capital is once for all destroyed although this very destruction since it does not affect the usevalue may very much expedite the new reproduction this is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest social geographer david harvey sums up the differences between marxs usage of these concepts and schumpeters both karl marx and joseph schumpeter wrote at length on the creativedestructive tendencies inherent in capitalism while marx clearly admired capitalisms creativity he  strongly emphasised its selfdestructiveness the schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalisms endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business other early usageedit in hinduism the god shiva is simultaneously destroyer and creator portrayed as shiva nataraja lord of the dance which is proposed as the source of the western notion of creative destruction in philosophical terms the concept of creative destruction is close to hegel´s concept of sublation in german economic discourse it was taken up from marxs writings by werner sombart particularly in his  text krieg und kapitalismus again however from destruction a new spirit of creation arises the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood forced the use of coal for heating forced the invention of coke for the production of iron hugo reinert has claimed that sombarts formulation of the concept was influenced by eastern mysticism specifically the image of the hindu god shiva who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator conceivably this influence passed from johann gottfried herder who brought hindu thought to german philosophy in his philosophy of human history ideen zur philosophie der geschichte der menschheit herder – specifically volume iii pp – via arthur schopenhauer and the orientalist friedrich maier through friedrich nietzsche´s writings nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of dionysus a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time destructively creative and creatively destructive in the following passage from on the genealogy of morality  nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction such that every creative act has its destructive consequence but have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost how much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered how many lies have had to be sanctified how many consciences disturbed how much god sacrificed every time if a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled – friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morality other nineteenthcentury formulations of this idea include russian anarchist mikhail bakunin who wrote in  the passion for destruction is a creative passion too note however that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed destructive creationoriginal research and differs sharply from marxs and schumpeters formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both marx and schumpeter association with joseph schumpeteredit the expression creative destruction was popularized by and is most associated with joseph schumpeter particularly in his book capitalism socialism and democracy first published in  already in his  book business cycles he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of nikolai kondratieff and his longwave cycle which schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation three years later in capitalism socialism and democracy schumpeter introduced the term creative destruction which he explicitly derived from marxist thought analysed extensively in part i of the book and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation capitalism  is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary  the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates  the opening up of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as us steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one this process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in  capitalism requires the perennial gale of creative destruction in schumpeters vision of capitalism innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological organizational regulatory and economic paradigms however schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalisms own institutional frameworks in breaking down the precapitalist framework of society capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse that process impressive in its relentless necessity was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema  the capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept making it central to his economic theory and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the socalled austrian school of freemarket economic thoughtcitation needed examplesedit polaroid instant cameras have disappeared almost completely with the spread of digital photography schumpeter  in one of his examples used the railroadization of the middle west as it was initiated by the illinois central he wrote the illinois central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated but it spelled the death sentence for the old agriculture of the west companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example xerox in copiers or polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs in technology the cassette tape replaced the track only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc which was undercut by downloads to mp players which is now being usurped by webbased streaming services companies which made money out of technology which becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies one such example is the way in which online adsupported news sites such as the huffington post are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper the christian science monitor announced in january  that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition the seattle postintelligencer became onlineonly in march  at a national level in usa employment in the newspaper business fell from  in  to  in  over that same period employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from  to  traditional french alumni networks which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as linkedin and viadeo in fact successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power eroding the profits and position of old firms yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market and back again it has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics david ames wells  who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late th century gave many examples of creative destruction without using the term brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency shipping the international telegraph network and agricultural mechanization later developmentsedit ludwig lachmannedit these economic facts have certain social consequences as the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on social grounds it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process we have already spoken of it as a leveling process more aptly we may now describe these results as an instance of what pareto called the circulation of elites wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands it passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value now on this now on that specific resource engendering capital gains and losses the owners of wealth we might say with schumpeter are like the guests at a hotel or the passengers in a train they are always there but are never for long the same people — ludwig lachmann the market economy and the distribution of wealth david harveyedit geographer and historian david harvey in a series of works from the s onwards social justice and the city  the limits to capital  the urbanization of capital  spaces of hope  spaces of capital  spaces of neoliberalization  the enigma of capital and the crises of capitalism  elaborated marxs thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment and to the production of space more broadly he developed the notion that capitalism finds a spatial fix for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure buildings etc the built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus while the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement it can also constitute a limit in its own right as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form as capital cannot abide a limit to profitability ever more frantic forms of timespace compression increased speed of turnover innovation of ever faster transport and communications infrastructure flexible accumulation ensue often impelling technological innovation such innovation however is a doubleedged sword the effect of continuous innovation  is to devalue if not destroy past investments and labour skills creative destruction is embedded within the circulation of capital itself innovation exacerbates instability insecurity and in the end becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis  the struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities new product lines are opened up and that means the creation of new wants and needs capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others  the result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another leaving whole sectors devastated  the drive to relocate to more advantageous places the geographical movement of both capital and labour periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity the resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to the twinkling of an eye globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of timespace compression allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations hence in this continual process of creative destruction capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises but merely moves them around geographically marshall bermanedit in his  book all that is solid melts into air the experience of modernity particularly in the chapter entitled innovative selfdestruction pp – marshall berman provides a reading of marxist creative destruction to explain key processes at work within modernity the title of the book is taken from a wellknown passage from the communist manifesto berman elaborates this into something of a zeitgeist which has profound social and cultural consequences the truth of the matter as marx sees is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down all that is solid—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them to the men and women who work the machines to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved so they can be recycled or replaced next week and the whole process can go on again and again hopefully forever in ever more profitable forms the pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts gothic cathedrals here berman emphasizes marxs perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalisms immense creative forces and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity manuel castellsedit the sociologist manuel castells in his trilogy on the information age economy society and culture the first volume of which the rise of the network society appeared in  reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe while divesting from others using the new paradigm of informational networks in the era of globalization capitalism is characterized by nearinstantaneous flow creating a new spatial dimension the space of flows while technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks indeed the new spatial form of the megacity or megalopolis is defined by castells as having the contradictory quality of being globally connected and locally disconnected physically and socially castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction the spirit of informationalism is the culture of creative destruction accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals schumpeter meets weber in the cyberspace of the network enterprise daniele archibugiedit developing the schumpeterian legacy the school of the science policy research unit of the university of sussex has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring in particular how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change chris freeman and carlota perez have developed these insights more recently daniele archibugi and andrea filippetti have associated the  economic crisis to the slowdown of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies icts using as a metaphor the film blade runner archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in  all those associated to icts have become part of our everyday life but on the contrary none of those in the field of biotech have been fully commercialized a new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices we should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology icts have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life they have generated jobs and profits but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life why have these not yet been delivered what can be done to unleash their potential there are a few basic questions that need to be addressed othersedit in  the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by philippe aghion and peter howitt giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to paul romers expanding varieties model in  harvard business school authors richard l nolan and david c croson released creative destruction a sixstage process for transforming the organization the book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage more recently the idea of creative destruction was utilized by max page in his  book the creative destruction of manhattan – the book traces manhattans constant reinvention often at the expense of preserving a concrete past describing this process as creative destruction page describes the complex historical circumstances economics social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in manhattans cityscape in addition to max page others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization tc chang and shirlena huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper recreating place replacing memory creative destruction at the singapore river the authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region rosemary wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central paris france known as les halles les halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century ultimately in  the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down in their place now stand a hub for trains subways and buses les halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in france and the controversial centre georges pompidou the term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts alan ackerman and martin puncher  edited a collection of essays under the title against theater creative destruction on the modernist stage they detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics they speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of antitheatricality straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions which might be considered avantgarde staging techniques in his  book still the new world american literature in a culture of creative destruction philip fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century including the works of such authors as ralph waldo emerson walt whitman herman melville mark twain and henry james among others fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology neoconservative author michael ledeen argued in his  book the war against the terror masters that america is a revolutionary nation undoing traditional societies creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law his characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development the connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by stuart l hart and mark b milstein in their  article global sustainability and the creative destruction of industries in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative

tend to address the symptoms of marital trouble while neglecting the real problem the cause of our marriage battles is neither our marriage nor our spouse harvey says its the sin in our hearts entirely totally exclusively without exception this is taught clearly and consistently in scripture from the first sin to the final judgment when sinners say i do however does not bemoan the problem but clearly exults in the solutionthe gospel harvey quickly points out that the gospel is greater than our sin and applying it inspires hope and begins the exciting process of change harvey believes that a right understanding of our own sin is the necessary first step to happiness in marriage avoiding the psychological discussions that fill the pages of popular needs based resources he instead encourages readers to understand how the cross can transform our conflicts our weakness yes even our sex lives god wants christians to delight in marriage and he has made provision in the gospel to do so but we cant truly understand the gospel or even the basic problems of every marriage until we come to terms with the undeniable reality of sin men and women and me find real hope and help when we realize that god uses marriage to reveal the heart and change the soul this discovery process is an adventure that lasts until death do us part according to harvey gods grace can revolutionize christian marriages in this book readers discover that grace is sufficient to train us and transform us grace excavates all the way down to our core desires and redirects them to god he writes what we want in life actually changes grace renovates us and never quits when sinners say i do highlights the stubborn grace available for couples to bring help and change as a graduate of the doctoral program at westminster theological seminary harveys combination of biblical truth and humorous vignettes from his own year marriage produces a book that is as enjoyable as it is provoking his treatment of this complicated topic leads to a hopeful conclusion until we understand the problem we will not be able to delight in the solution when the sin we bring to marriage becomes real to us then the gospel becomes vital and marriage becomes sweet christianbookpreviewscom▼▲ do we really need another book on marriage yes if its the book when sinners say i do by dave harvey senior pastor of covenant fellowship church glen mills pa most of the marriage books written in recent years even the christian ones focus on felt needs selfesteem and other psychological hot buttons harvey has refreshingly given us a great handbook for defeating the number one enemy of marriages  sin sin as a subject matter in relation to marriage automatically sounds like a downer nothing could be further from the truth and this book reminds us of that biblical truth harvey has set out to construct a thoroughly biblical approach of applying the gospel  the good news  to the bad news of sin and its destructive power in marriages the result an engaging practical guide for any marriage i highly recommend when sinners say i do this book will be a great resource both in marriage prep and in marriage health if you are looking for a book that avoids the fluff of so many similar books yet one that is grounded not only in sound doctrine but in the reality of daily life this book is for you my only question when will the study guide be available  todd burgett christian book previewscom product reviews▼▲  stars out of   out of   stars   stars   stars   stars   star  quality  out of

discovering the power of the gospel for marriage another book on marriage really yes really if you love to learn by reading and want an exceptional book on marriage than you should read this one dave harvey pastor of covenant fellowship church in glen mills pa a sovereign grace ministries church ie cj mahaney and josh harris has done the church a great service within ten chapters pastor harvey sets out ten biblically strong and practical topics he begins with the foundational doctrine of sinful humanity this may seem obvious but this book is a light doctrinal thesis on what is sin and how it damages our lives and especially our marriages with amazing clarity he helps us navigate who we are before a holy god and therefore who we are for our spouse without using phychological jargon and only biblical jargon he helps us inspect our lives with gods law and grace he also deals with mercy forgiveness and grace as related to our marriages did i like this book yes i am leary about marriage books but once i got started into this one i realized i was taking it for granted and had to go back and reread the first two chapters it was then i realized i was hooked pastor harvey gives great insight into sin the glory of god mercy forgiveness and grace and applies it appropriately to our marriages is this a marriage book yes but only after being a well crafted book about the goodness of jesus despite our sinfulness i will reference this book again and again and will probably require its reading for marriages i counsel as a pastor myself i would use this book not for newlyweds but for those one to two year marriages who are struggling the young marriage that realizes that their spouse and their marriage isnt all bliss i would strongly encourage any married couple who needs a boast in the theology of their marriage to read this book this book was given to me by shepherd press as a review in exchange for my honest and realistic review was this review helpful helpful votes yes
