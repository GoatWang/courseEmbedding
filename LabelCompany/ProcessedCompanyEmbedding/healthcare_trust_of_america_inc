office benefiting from several significant macroeconomic drivers such as an aging population millennia ls beginning to form families and an increase in the insured population these trends are driving growth in healthcare spending at a rate significantly faster than the broader us economy the us population is experiencing significant aging of its population as advancements in medical technology and changes in treatment methods enable people to live longer this is expected to drive healthcare utilization higher as individuals consume more healthcare as they get older between  and  the us population over  years of age is projected to increase by more than  and total over  of the us population as the baby boomer generation enters retirement individuals of this age spend the highest amounts on healthcare averaging over  per individual over the age of  according to  consumer expenditure survey this compares to healthcare expenditures of less than  per year for individuals under the age of  the older population group will increasingly require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments much of this increased care is taking place in lower cost outpatient settings which we believe will continue to support mob demand in the long term in addition the large millennial generation is just now starting to reach their thirties and form families which should result in average healthcare expenditures for this age group doubling as this large generation utilizes additional healthcare services it is expected they will choose more convenient outpatient settings the number of insured individuals in the us continues to increase as the population grows and as a result of the impact of us government actions including the patient protection and affordable care act of  the “affordable care act” since  the number of individuals covered by healthcare insurance in the us has increased over  although government policies may change under different administrations the emphasis on providing affordable healthcare insurance for individuals is expected to remain a priority for government officials at the same time technological advances are pushing healthcare into more cost efficient and integrated outpatient settings as a result hospitals are reevaluating their business models to capture gains in efficiency this push is driving medical procedures and other healthcare delivery which has historically been conducted at a hospital into outpatient settings via medical offices similarly physicians and health systems are grouping together to increase their overhead efficiency and invest in new technology healthcare is increasingly being provided in part by nurses physician assistants and allied health providers a key reason that
