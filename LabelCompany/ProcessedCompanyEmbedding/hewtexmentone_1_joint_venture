up with a committed partner to form a jv it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary this is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs especially in approaches to government often the deciding body for the formation of a jv or dispute settlement the ideal process of

following major ways foreign investor buying an interest in a local company local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise together with public capital andor bank debt in the uk india and in many common law countries a jointventure or else a company formed by a group of individuals must file with the appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of incorporation a company can commence its business shareholders agreementedit this is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ particularly on the enforceability of heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential chinese party parts of this article those related to distribution analysis of jv in industry need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information

template message a joint venture jv is a business entity created by two or more parties generally characterized by shared ownership shared returns and risks and shared governance most joint ventures are incorporated although some as in the oil and gas industry are unincorporated joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity key elements of a joint ventures design include  the number of parties  the geographic product technology and valuechain scope within which the jv will operate  the contributions of the parties  the structural form each country has specific options eg in the us the main options are a c corporation or an llcpartnership structure  the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties  the economic arrangements postdeal eg is the joint venture intended to general profits vs operate as a costsharing or productionsharing venture if a forprofit entity will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership or some other way  governance and control  talenthr model will the jv have its own staff on own payroll vs second staff from the parent companies  contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs outputs or services  exit and evolution provisions companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons to access a new market particularly emerging markets to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations to share risk for major investments or projects or to access skills and capabilities in european law the term joint venture or joint undertaking is an elusive legal concept better defined under the rules of company law in france the term joint venture is variously translated association dentreprises entreprise conjointe coentreprise or entreprise commune in germany joint venture is better represented as a combination of companies konzern with individuals when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are coventurers the venture can be a business jv for example dow corning a projectasset jv intended to pursue one specific project only or a jv aimed at defining standards or serving as an industry utility that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants some major joint ventures include millercoors sony

cooperative joint ventures  wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoes  foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs  investment companies by foreign investors icfi  joint ventures in india  joint ventures in ukraine  dissolution  see also  references  external links jv processedit overall the jv process has a series of steps defining the business strategy determining whether a jv is the right vehicle this requires comparing the jv option against acquisition nonequity partnership contractual alliance or goalone approaches generally jvs are most appropriate when  they are focused on combining complementary capabilities eg products and market access sharing risks or  merging businesses where an outright ma transaction isnt possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition cant be recovered via operating synergies and  when goitalone is too risky or too slow and  simpler vehicles like contractual agreements arent sufficient screening partners developing the jv deal concept negotiating detailed terms and conditions planning and launching the jv evolving or terminating the jv partner selectionedit while the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a jv it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary this is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs especially in approaches to government often the deciding body for the formation of a jv or dispute settlement the ideal process of selecting a jv partner emerges from screening of prospective partners short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture the most appropriate structure and invitationbid foreign investor buying an interest in a local company companies are also called jvs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public there may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity these companies may be public or private companies it would be out of place to describe them except to say there are many in india further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up such an enterprise is sometimes called an incorporated jv one packaged with technology contracts knowhow patents trademarks and copyright technical services and assistedsupply arrangements the consortium jv also known as a cooperative agreement is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements franchise and brand use agreements management contracts rental agreements for onetime contracts eg for construction projects they dissolve the jv when that goal is reached company incorporationedit a jv can be brought about in the following major ways foreign investor buying an interest in a local company local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise together with public capital andor bank debt in the uk india and in many common law countries a jointventure or else a company formed by a group of individuals must file with the appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of incorporation a company can commence its business shareholders agreementedit this is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ particularly on the enforceability of heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures

language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs especially in approaches to government often the deciding body for the formation of a jv or dispute settlement the ideal process of

following major ways foreign investor buying an interest in a local company local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise together with public capital andor bank debt in the uk india and in many common law countries a jointventure or else a company formed by a group of individuals must file with the appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of incorporation a company can commence its business shareholders agreementedit this is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ particularly on the enforceability of heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential chinese party parts of this article those related to distribution analysis of jv in industry need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information

the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential

ground under a hybrid costplusawardfeefixedprice contract for a month phasein a month base period a month option and a ‑month option  rfp at   the statement of work sow described the general types of services required ranging from mission command and network systems testing to cyber security testing intelligence systems developmental test support and to electromagnetic environmental effect testing  rfp at   the rfp explained that “a majority of the work efforts    under this contract will be assigned by the government in the form of individual work assignment orders waos    ”  rfp at  ¶ j  accordingly the sow specified that the contractor shall provide personnel as required to meet variable workload demands as required by work authorization orders wao  variations in the total number of active test projects and other assigned responsibilities require that the contractor make provisions for accommodating a range in workforce size without adversely affecting performance  rfp at  ¶ c  as amended during the course of the procurement the rfp stated that a contract would be awarded to the firm whose proposal provided the best value considering five evaluation factors  mission support management past performance small business participation and costprice  id at   the management factor was slightly more important than the mission support factor  each was more important than the individual factors of past performance small business participation and costprice which were equally important  id  the noncostprice factors when combined were significantly more important than costprice  id at   the rfp identified two equallyweighted subfactors under the mission support factortechnical approach and technical expertiseand three equallyweighted subfactors under the management factormanagement structure and corporate experience phasein and financial system capability  id  the mission support and management factors and their subfactors were to be rated adjectivally using the ratings of outstanding good acceptable marginal and unacceptable  id at ‑  none of the other factors are at issue here  the army received proposals from eight offerors including mttjv and jacobs  ar at   on march   the army awarded a contract to a third offeror and four competitors filed protests three with our office and one with the contracting officer  id  the army took corrective action held discussions amended the rfp and received and evaluated revised proposals  id  on december   the army awarded the contract to jacobs and two competitors protested  id  the army again took corrective action and requested proposal revisions  id at   after evaluating the revised proposals the army sent each offeror a summary of its evaluation and allowed them to submit final proposal revisions fpr by october    id  as reflected in the contemporaneous record the relevant results of the final evaluation were   jacobs mttjv mission support good acceptable technical approach outstanding

costprice m m ar tab  source selection evaluation board report at   a source selection advisory council ssac reviewed the evaluation results for each offeror and recommended jacobs for award  the ssac provided a briefing to the source selection authority ssa that described the offerors’ strengths weaknesses and adjectival ratings under the nonprice factors and subfactors  tab  ssac report briefing slides at   the ssac then reviewed the offerors’ evaluated costprices from the prior award and the amount by which each had changed  their analysis identified mttjv as one of two offerors that made significant reductions to its costprices when compared to the first source selection decision  in both cases the ssac pointed to reduced staffing for the instrumentation and software development requirement  id at   the ssac stated that mttjv had provided an “unsatisfactory explanation of the effects” of lowering the staffing for that requirement from its earlier proposal  id at   in contrast the ssac noted that the total evaluated costprice for jacobs was nearly unchanged from its initial proposal  id at   after setting forth the detailed strengths and weaknesses of the offerors the ssac compared jacobs to the other offerors in terms of adjectival ratings and evaluated costprice  id at   for each offeror except jacobs the ssac recommended that the offeror be eliminated from further consideration for award based on its lower ratings  id  the ssac then reviewed specific evaluated strengths for jacobs’s fpr  id at ‑  the ssac concluded by noting that jacobs’s adjectival ratings were superior to other offerors that its costprice had been “the most stable and consistent” throughout the procurement and that it had remained the “most consistent proposal    since inception when considering mission support and management factors”  id at   the ssac’s briefing for the ssa consolidated the evaluation of each offeror’s proposal and the ssac’s recommendation that all other offerors be eliminated from competition and award made to jacobs  see generally id  the ssa reviewed the ssac briefing and the evaluation summary  she prepared a source selection decision which reiterated the evaluation summary for each offeror and discussed whether jacobs’s fpr provided sufficient technical superiority to justify award at its higher price compared to mttjv and the other remaining competitors  the ssa concluded that jacobs’s proposal was the best value and selected it for award  ar tab  source selection decision document ssdd at   on november  the army announced the award to jacobs and this protest followed  analysis mttjv challenges the evaluation of its proposal under the mission support and management factors  the protester argues that the army unreasonably assigned weaknesses to its proposal based on unstated evaluation criteria and failed to recognize as strengths several aspects of its proposal that were identified as important strengths in jacobs’s proposal  as a result mttjv argues that the army unreasonably assigned mttjv lower adjectival ratings and then improperly relied on those adjectival ratings in the source selection decision as the basis to justify awarding the contract to jacobs at its higher evaluated costprice  we note at the onset that the evaluation of proposals is largely a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion so our office’s role is not to reevaluate proposals but instead to examine the record to determine whether the agency’s judgment was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations  hiway paving inc b jan    cpd ¶  at   in making a bestvalue tradeoff between non‑price factors and costprice a source selection authority has broad discretion which is subject only to the tests of rationality and consistency with the evaluation criteria  the propriety of the pricetechnical tradeoff decision turns on whether the selection official’s judgment concerning the significance of the difference in the technical ratings was reasonable and adequately justified  johnson controls world servs inc b b‑ may    cpd ¶  at   nevertheless systems such as point scoring or adjectival ratings are merely guides to intelligent decisionmaking but cannot take the place of a reasoned tradeoff decision  science applications int’l corp b‑ b‑ nov    cpd ¶  at  shumaker trucking  excavating contractors inc b‑ sept    cpd ¶  at   we address a selection of mttjv’s evaluation challenges as examples and we consider the arguments over the source selection rationale below  we have also reviewed several other arguments that mttjv raises such as contentions that the evaluation reflected unequal treatment but we do not address in detail here even though we have determined that they also lack merit  mission support factor under the technical approach subfactor mttjv argues that the army unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal based on concerns that the firm’s proposed staffing was “deleted” and thus posed a risk of unsuccessful contract performance  protest at   in this regard the rfp indicated that the army would evaluate whether the proposal showed the ability to demonstrate how it plans to perform multiple simultaneous technical requirements at different locations while managing personnel and responding to potential problem areas the extent to which the offeror demonstrates a thorough understanding of the required safety measures necessary to support multiple complex and hazardous tests in remote environments and proposes an effective approach to risk identification and mitigation the offeror’s ability to manage shifts of workload based on the proposed management structure and the offeror’s approach of managing the work authorization order wao process to include the crossutilization of personnel optimizing core experience and expertise across the waos      ar at  citing rfp at   mttjv’s initial proposal identified a risk in its staffing noting that the “biggest issue is deleted contractor support in many capabilities across the facilities  specifically some facility sme subject matter experts leads have deleted on station”  ar tab  mttjv mission support fpr redlined version at  text shown as deleted from fpr  the army expressed concern during discussions with the firm’s solution to deleted staffing for facilities leads  ar tab  second evaluation summary for mttjv at   in response mttjv’s fpr added an explanation describing its plans for crosstraining and crossutilization identifying specific personnel to serve as backups for facility leads and noting that it had access to deleted testing and evaluation professionals with a “reachback capability to provide continuity of effort in the event ‘deleted’ smes are not available”  ar tab  mttjc mission support fpr at   mttjv further explained that in  it had “received reachback support from an affiliated company to help design test cases for dcgsa distributed common ground systemarmy tests at usaepg”  id at   mttjv also stated that it had used its reachback resources to obtain deleted fulltime equivalents for  months at significant cost savings to support fleet milestones and had brought in an sme to develop scenarios and to lead panels of senior experts and customers to facilitate a technical exchange of analysis  id at   in evaluating the fpr the army determined that the weakness should remain  while the evaluators agreed that the fpr had addressed the concern over facility team lead staffing they also concluded that mttjv had not addressed “critical smes unique to each facility which may not necessarily be the facility leads    or if these positions are deleted”  ar tab  fpr evaluation summary for mttjv at   mttjv argues that the assessment of a weakness was unreasonable because it provided an adequate technique to address the potential risk and showed successful use of that technique on the incumbent contract  further mttjv argues that the agency’s concern over the staffing of other than facility sme leads constituted the application of unstated evaluation criteria and was based on speculation  protest at   the army counters that the evaluators properly could not consider information outside of mttjv’s proposal in determining whether its efforts to mitigate the risk of deleted staffing had been resolved  ar at   in response to mttjv’s argument that the evaluation of this weakness was based on unstated evaluation criteria the army argues that it properly found that mttjv had only addressed part of the agency’s concern over the firm’s explanation of the risk to performance of deleted staffing  id at   we see no basis to conclude that the evaluation of this weakness was unreasonable  as explained above mttjv identified the risk of deleted staffing “in many capabilities across the facilities” and specifically recognized the risk of a staffing approach that “some facility sme leads have deleted on station”  ar tab  mttjv mission support fpr redlined version at   while mttjv argues that it properly mitigated that riskprincipally by identifying a specific person capable of serving as the backup for one position at each facilitythat approach did not address contingency planning for other facility sme leads which was the basis for retaining the weakness  in our view the army reasonably determined that its concerns were not completely addressed in mttjv’s fpr  we also disagree that the army relied on unstated evaluation criteria in assessing a weakness for mttjv’s planning for backups for other smes beyond the facility leads  offerors were required to address their “plans to perform multiple simultaneous technical requirements at different locations while managing personnel and responding to potential problems”  see rfp at   on this record we regard the agency’s evaluation as both reasonable and consistent with the criteria in the rfp  mttjv next argues that the agency improperly assigned its proposal a weakness for failing to provide an analysis or explanation of the reduction in labor hours it included in its fpr for the base period of the contract  protest at   the army explains that mttjv reduced the number of fulltime equivalents from deletedin its initial proposal to deletedin its fpr and that more than half of these reductions came from tasks that the agency characterized as critical  ar tab  fpr evaluation summary for mttjv at   the agency found that reducing the number of skilled and experienced positions impeded mttjv’s ability to perform the mission  the army also noted that the proposal’s failure to provide an analysis or explanation of how the reduction benefited the mission increased the risk of unsuccessful contract performance  id  mttjv argues that it did not provide an explanation in its fpr because its proposal indicated that it used the same process for laborhour estimating in its fpr as it had in its initial proposal  id at   in our view this argument actually underscores the reason for the agency’s concern  mttjv used the same process to estimate its hours but arrived at a very different result with no explanation for the difference  the protester further argues that over the course of the procurement from the march  initial proposals until the october  final fpr submission the firm’s work as the incumbent contractor allowed it to become more experienced and more efficient  id  however none of this explanation actually appears in the protester’s fpr  an offeror is responsible for submitting a wellwritten proposal with adequately detailed information that allows for meaningful review by the procuring agency  abacus tech corp sms data prods group inc b et al oct    cpd ¶  at   as a result we have no basis to question the reasonableness of the agency’s evaluation  the protester also argues that the army’s final evaluation improperly removed a strength that had been assigned to its proposal during the initial evaluation concerning the firm’s cost reduction efforts  protest at   mttjv argues that the strength was based on its performance as the incumbent and that its successful efforts as the incumbent did not disappear during the corrective action period  id  the strength assigned to mttjv’s initial proposal was based on its costreduction efforts from the incumbent contract which were achieved through the use of deletedpersonnel to supplement and bolster epg’s core test support work force during peak labor periods  ar tab  mttjv initial proposal evaluation summary at   the agency explains that when mttjv revised its cost proposal the first time it reduced the number of labor hours for fulltime personnel while increasing the proposed number of deletedpersonnel  the evaluators found that this change negated the initial strength and increased performance risk because with the increased number of deletedpersonnel there was no longer a potential for cost reductions by using deleted  ar tab  second evaluation summary for mttjv at  ar tab  mttjv final evaluation summary at   the agency explains that the strength assigned to mttjv’s initial proposal was based on the balance of fulltime and deletedpersonnel in meeting the requirement  when mttjv revised its cost proposal the agency concluded that it had created a performance risk because of its increased reliance on deletedpersonnel to perform critical functions  ar at   mttjv’s argument that its successful efforts as the incumbent did not disappear during the corrective action period fails to recognize that the strength was forwardlooking  that is the initial proposal provided a basis for the evaluators to conclude that the government would receive the same benefits in the future as in the past  however when mttjv revised its proposal the agency concluded that any benefit in cost reduction was now accompanied by a risk and that the proposal no longer warranted the strength  mttjv has given us no basis to find that this conclusion was unreasonable  finally under the technical expertise subfactor mttjv contends that its proposal was evaluated unequallytreated unequally from that of jacobs  specifically the protester argues that both firms proposed similar access to smes but only jacobs’s proposal was evaluated as having a strength  this argument has no merit where a protester alleges that a technical evaluation is the product of unequal treatment the protester must show that the differences in ratings were in fact the result of unequal treatment rather than differences in the offerors’ proposals  see northrop grumman sys corp b b may    cpd ¶  at   here the rfp required all offerors to propose access to smes  eg rfp at  smes “serve as technical consultants to project managers” ‑ smes provide input coordination and comments on test operating procedures  smes included in tier  support for complex hardware and operating system software  the agency assigned a strength to jacobs’s proposal not just because it proposed access to smes but because it proposed access to several highlyskilled technical fellows with expertise in specified areas  the army concluded that this feature would be beneficial for addressing difficult technical problems  ar tab  source selection evaluation board report at   while mttjv argues that it also proposed access to smes it makes the argument generally without identifying specific aspects of its proposal to show that it exceeded the rfp requirement to an extent that was equivalent to jacobs’s fpr  as a result we have no basis to find unequal treatment in the evaluation  management factor under the management structure and corporate experience subfactor mttjv also argues that the agency evaluated its proposal unequally compared to the jacobs evaluation  mttjv contends that the agency credited jacobs for its internal quality assurance process for management but made no mention of mttjv’s quality management system  protester’s comments at   as with the firm’s unequal treatment argument above the protester’s allegation here lacks merit the rfp required all offers to address certain elements as a minimum concerning quality control  rfp at    the agency states that mttjv’s quality management system was deemed to have unlike jacobs merely met the requirements  supplemental ar at   mttjv argues that its own quality control procedures were detailed and “top notch” and disputes that jacobs’s proposal could have been materially better  protester’s comments at  protester’s supplemental comments at   the protester asserts that it used similar terminology such as having a formalized system supporting onsite quality control and process improvement using metrics and enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of services to describe its own quality assurance approach as the evaluators used in assigning a strength to jacobs’s approach  id  we are not persuaded that these superficial similarities are sufficient to call into question the agency’s assignment of a strength for jacobs’s quality assurance approach  northrop grumman sys corp supra  under the phasein factor mttjv’s supplemental protest similarly argues that its proposal was evaluated unequally from the jacobs proposal reasoning that as the incumbent mttjv’s phasein approach should have been rated at least as highly as that of jacobs’s approach  protester’s comments at   in its supplemental agency report the agency responded to the firm’s argument in detail emphasizing the narrative explanation provided by the evaluators for rating jacobs’s proposal highly  supplemental ar at   in its comments on the supplemental report mttjv does not meaningfully challenge the agency’s rebuttal  we will deny a protest where the protester fails to meet its burden of showing that an evaluation was unreasonable and in that respect mere disagreement with the agency without more does not suffice to show that an evaluation was unreasonable  globecomm sys inc b b‑ oct    cpd ¶  at  see also nd century techs inc b et al mar    cpd ¶  at  issues not rebutted in comments are deemed abandoned  source selection decision mttjv argues that the source selection decision was unreasonable because it was based on the evaluation errors discussed above  the protester also contends that the agency evaluation was unreasonable because in recommending jacobs for award the ssac emphasized an aspect that is unrelated to the evaluation criteria in the rfp  that jacobs’s proposal had been the “most stable and consistent” of all the offerors throughout the procurement  supplemental protest at   the protester also argues that the ssa overrelied on ssac views that focused on strengths of jacobs’s fpr to recommend award to it while disregarding advantages of mttjv’s fpr  in making a source selection decision the ssa need not review the proposals or complete evaluation documentation but instead can rely upon a briefing that presents the results of the evaluation  sabreliner corp b b mar   ‑ cpd ¶  at   furthermore a source selection decision need not address and discuss every evaluated strength and weakness of the competing proposals rather the decision must sufficiently document the rationale for business judgments and tradeoffs made by the ssa and the benefits associated with additional costs  eg telecommunication sys inc b‑ dec    cpd ¶  at  see also far §   with respect to mttjv’s alleged evaluation errors as discussed above we find no flaw in the evaluation and thus no related error in the bestvalue tradeoff  with respect to the argument that the bestvalue tradeoff improperly considered the stability and consistency of jacobs’s fpr mttjv acknowledges that the ssa did not include that consideration in explaining the source selection decision rationale but argues that given the ssa’s reliance on the ssac’s conclusions in other respects the allegedly improper consideration of stability and consistency affected the ssa’s judgment  we recognize that as mttjv argues much of the ssa’s stated rationale repeats the ssac’s evaluation conclusions  nevertheless we cannot adopt mttjv’s argument that the ssac’s application of an allegedly unstated and contradictory criterion should be presumed to have affected the ssa’s judgment  in this regard the ssa’s source selection decision makes no reference to the issue  to the contrary the record here adequately documents the ssa’s independent judgmentincluding omission of the ssac’s consideration of proposal stability or consistencyand properly identifies aspects of jacobs’s proposal that the ssa considered in determining that jacobs’s proposal offered the best value to the government despite its higher evaluated costprice  accordingly we deny mttjv’s challenge to the bestvalue tradeoff  the protest is denied  susan a poling general counsel  the protester states that one of its joint venturers is the incumbent contractor  protest at    except where specifically indicated citations to the rfp in this decision are to the conformed rfp provided at tab  of the agency report ar exhibits  the rfp also provided an option for up to  additional months of services per federal acquisition regulation far clause   rfp at    the army explains that waos are issued by army electronic proving ground epg personnel to assign test services work to the contractor and to track and bill the costs incurred  however waos are not issued by a contracting officer and are not task orders  id at  email from army counsel to gao feb   at    for one of these offerors the ssac also identified its higher price as supporting its elimination from consideration  id  mttjv also argues that neither the rfp nor the agency required a certain level of effort and that the agency is improperly holding the firm to an unstated level of effort  however it is readily apparent from the record that the agency’s concern was in fact that mttjv did not explain why its level of effort changed   here and in other instances mttjv has argued that the contemporaneous record lacks a sufficient explanation for the army’s evaluation judgments and thus the agency’s offered justifications in support of the evaluation during this protest should be afforded little weight  however in these circumstances our office will consider postprotest explanations because they provide a detailed rationale for contemporaneous conclusions and simply fill in previously unrecorded details  global
