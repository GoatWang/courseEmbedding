philosophy investment philosophy overpaying for a stock is one of the greatest investment risks it can be managed by developing an intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioaps’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since aps’ founding in investigative research beyond bottomupasian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by  experienced local investment professionals and  probing research we conduct onsite visits field investigations including interviews with former employees competitors suppliers industry specialists and other stakeholders and verification of information and data with independent sources the extensive granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock conduct due diligence and think independently of consensusrigorous valuationduring some market cycles investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly thus tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retaildominated asian markets instead portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alphadiversified strategies please see our explanation of alpha groups in the alpha groups  generation section  our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth and whether the listed price reflects that worth the key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals sell disciplinewe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when  prices run ahead of fundamentals  initial assumptions are proven wrong  there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company redefining riskin our view there are risks greater than volatility such as overpaying for a security visàvis its fundamentals that is why we examine every stock insideout before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles political fluctuations regulatory changes structural events management changeovers among otherswe also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of highconviction stocks which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time and as appropriate in order to earn an illiquidity premium competitive advantages from aps’ investment approach our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process it goes beyond bottomup research  when the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions without being influenced by market noise this knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when lessinformed investors irrationally run for the exit revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets   get in touch    csapscomsg investment philosophy investment
