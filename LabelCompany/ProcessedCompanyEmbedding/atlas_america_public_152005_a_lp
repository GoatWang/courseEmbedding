beliefs forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made the matters discussed in these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made projected or implied in the forwardlooking statements we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable however our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the future business overview atlas america public  a lp we us or the partnership is a delaware limited partnership and formed on july   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or the mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp nyse arp   on february   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy which was a publicly traded masterlimited partnership was acquired by targa resources corp and distributed to atlas energys unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner atlas energy group llc atlas energy group otcqx atls atlas energy group became a separate publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the mgp as a result of the distribution following the distribution atlas energy group continues to manage arps operations and activities through its ownership of the arps general partner interest the partnership has drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania and tennessee we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy group february   and prior atlas energy for administrative services see item  executive compensation the partnerships operating cash flows are generated from its wells which produce natural gas and oil produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems the partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold the partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling the economic viability of the partnerships production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving drilling completing or reworking a well there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues the prices at which the partnerships natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the partnerships cash flow and the value of its reserves lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the partnerships revenues but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the partnership can produce economically historically there has been no need to borrow funds from the mgp to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners however the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended accordingly the mgp determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the mgp intends as necessary to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months the mgp has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which primarily produce natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as  well tending routine maintenance and adjustment  reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and  preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of december   our mgp withheld  of net production revenue for this purpose   markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry natural gas the mgp markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to thirdparty plant operators who process and market the gas the sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index the production area and pricing indices for the appalachian basin are dominion south point tennessee gas pipeline transco leidy line columbia appalachia nymex and transco zone  we do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes as is customary in certain of our other operating areas we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement crude oil crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company the crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region less appropriate trucking charges we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements for the year ended december   chevron natural gas and atmos energy marketing llc accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our total natural gas and oil production revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than  of revenues for this period general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of  and throughout  the causes of these declines are based on a number of factors including but not limited to a significant increase in natural gas oil and ngl production while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the longterm in the areas in which we operate fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas oil and ngl reserves our future gas and oil reserves production cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently we face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas oil and ngl prices as initial reservoir pressures are depleted natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases   results of operations gas and oil production the following table sets forth information related to our production revenues volumes sales prices production costs and depletion during the periods indicated years ended december    production revenues in thousands gas     oil

mcfe      average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges  average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period previously recognized derivative gains were  for the year ended december   natural gas revenues our natural gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions and a  decrease in production volumes our production volumes decreased to  mcf per day for the year ended december   from  mcf per day for the year ended december   a decrease of   mcf per day the price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements see item  businesscontractual revenue arrangements thus the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions the overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in number of producing wells due to wells shutdue to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing environment oil revenues we drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas rather than oil but some wells have limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in oil revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in oil prices partially offset by an increase in production volumes of  our production volumes increased to  bbl per day for the year ended december   from  per day for the year ended december   an increase of   bbl per day gain on marktomarket derivatives on january   we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives as such subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain on marktomarket derivatives on our statements of operations the fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as of december   which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners capital on our balance sheet will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle   we recognized a gain on marktomarket derivatives of  for the year ended december   this gain was due primarily to marktomarket gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year there were no gains or losses on marktomarket derivatives during the year ended december   costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transportation expenses the transportation charges were affected by a decrease in production volumes depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively this change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us impairment of gas and oil properties for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively at least annually we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value to the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value an impairment charge is recognized as a result of this assessment an impairment charge was recognized for the years ended december   and  this charge is based on reserve quantities future market prices and our carrying value we cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods liquidity and capital resources we are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of  and throughout  the extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook we have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices our mgp continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs including renegotiating contracts with contractors suppliers and service providers reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs our mgp will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and in turn our liquidity to meet our operating needs to the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further or we experience other disruptions in the industry our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted and could result in the mgps decision to liquidate our operations historically there has been no need to borrow funds from the mgp to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners however the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended accordingly the mgp determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the mgp intends as necessary to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months the mgp has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern if however the mgp were to decide to liquidate our operations the liquidation valuation of the partnerships assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert it is possible that based on such determination we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners a liquidation could result in the transfer of the postliquidation assets and liabilities of the partnership to the mgp and would occur without any further contribution from or distributions to the limited partners there was no cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   a decrease of  as compared to the year ended december   this decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion impairment and accretion of  a decrease in the noncash gain loss on derivative value of  and a decrease in the accounts receivable tradeaffiliate of  partially offset by the increase in the accounts payable tradeaffiliate of  an increase in the asset retirement receivableaffiliate of  an increase in accrued liabilities of  and an increase in the asset retirement obligations settled of  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   there was no cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities was  during the year ended december   resulting from the sale of tangible equipment   there was no cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   was  resulting from cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs through december   our mgp has withheld  of funds for this purpose any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties impairment during the year ended december   we recognized  of impairment related to gas and oil properties within property plant and equipment on our balance sheet this impairment related to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices during the year ended december   we recognized  of impairment related to gas and oil properties within property plant and equipment on our balance sheet environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety see item  business environmental matters and regulation we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil or criminal penalties imposition of remedial requirements issuance of injunctions affecting our operations or other measures we have maintained and expect to continue to maintain environmental compliance programs however risks of accidental leaks or spills are associated with our operations there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities relating to claims for damages to property the environment natural resources or persons resulting from the operation of our business moreover it is possible other developments such as increasingly strict federal state and local environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased costs and liabilities to us environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last  years and we anticipate that such changes will continue trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants generation and disposal of wastes including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials and use storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health the environment andor threatened or endangered species other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change or that our efforts will prevent material costs if any from rising changes in prices and inflation our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects   critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals depletion and amortization impairment fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions we summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements see item  financial statements included in this report the critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below depletion and impairment of longlived assets longlived assets the cost of natural gas and oil properties less estimated salvage value is generally depleted on the unitsofproduction method natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable a longlived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions including natural gas and oil prices production and operating expenses any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset as discussed in general trends and outlook within this section recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include among other factors operating losses unused capacity market value declines technological developments resulting in obsolescence changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products changes in competition and competitive practices uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies changes in the expected level of environmental capital operating or remediation expenditures and changes in governmental regulations or actions during the year ended december   we recognized  of impairment within natural gas and oil properties the impairment related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices at the date of measurement during the year ended december   we recognized  of impairment within natural gas and oil properties as a result of the recent significant declines in commodity prices and associated recorded impairment charges remaining net book value of gas and oil properties on our balance sheet at december   was primarily related to the estimated salvage value of such properties the estimated salvage values were based on our mgps historical experience in determining such values and were discounted based on the remaining lives of those wells using an assumed credit adjusted riskfree interest rate fair value of financial instruments we have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources whereas unobservable inputs reflect the partnerships own market assumptions which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort the hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability level   unobservable inputs that reflect the entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques   we use a fair value methodology to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts our commodity hedges are calculated based on observable market data related to the change in price of the underlying commodity and are therefore defined as level  fair value measurements liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include our asset retirement obligations aro that are defined as level  estimates of the fair value of aros are based on discounted cash flows using numerous estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the cost timing of settlement our mgps creditadjusted riskfree rate and inflation rates reserve estimates our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions including those required by the sec as to natural gas and oil prices drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures and availability of funds the accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data the interpretation of that data the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates we engaged wright  company inc an independent thirdparty reserve engineer to prepare a report of our proved reserves see item  properties any significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves as a result our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise actual future production natural gas and oil prices revenues development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay distributions in addition our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history prevailing natural gas and oil prices mechanical difficulties governmental regulation and other factors many of which are beyond our control our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of natural gas and oil properties generally an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense we have experienced significant downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values in  due to the recent significant declines in commodity prices the proved reserves quantities and future net cash flows were estimated under the secs standardized measure using an unweighted month average pricing based on the gas and oil prices on the first day of each month during the year ended december   including adjustments related to regional price differentials and energy content the secs standardized measure of reserve quantities and discounted future net cash flows may not represent the fair market value of our gas and oil equivalent reserves due to anticipated future changes in gas and oil commodity prices accordingly such information should not serve as a basis in making any judgement on the potential value of recoverable reserves or in estimating future results of operations asset retirement obligations we recognize and estimate the liability for the plugging and abandonment of our gas and oil wells the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset the estimated liability is based on our historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements the liability is discounted using our mgps assumed creditadjusted riskfree interest rate revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements we have no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations except for our gas and oil properties we believe that there are no other material retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets working interest our partnership agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to our mgp and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions working interest our mgp is also provided an additional working interest of  as provided in the partnership agreement due to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all drilling costs estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are utilized to allocate revenues and expense until the wells are completely drilled and turned online into production once the wells are completed the final working interest ownership of the partners is determined and any previously allocated revenues based on the estimated working interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the final working interest percentage ownership   disclosure the views and

partnership formed on july   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania and tennessee we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce natural gas and oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or thirdparty gas gathering systems we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as · well tending routine maintenance and adjustment · reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and · preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of june   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our

and  respectively an increase of   the  increase in natural gas revenues for the three months ended june   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a  increase in our natural

respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp the changes for the three and six months ended june   are primarily due to thirdparty costs as compared to the prior year similar period liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased  in the six months ended june   to

equipment cash used in financing activities decreased  during the six months ended june   to  from  for the six months ended june   this decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates
