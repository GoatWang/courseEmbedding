ge aircraft engines one of the best performing units at ge producing the secondmost profits in ge by the time mcnerney was moved to ge aircraft engines observers believed that he was being groomed to take over as chairman of ge after two decades at helm legendary chairman john f welch announced his intention to retire in  with the actual event occurring in  mcnerney seemed like an ideal candidate to replace welch because of his vast experience in the company and because the company wanted to promote someone from a manufacturing or equipment business in ge mcnerney was already being pursued by other companies for executive positions he even had an offer to become the chief operating officer at microsoft but turned it down mcnerney wanted to remain at ge though there were concerns about his age and charisma as a potential candidate to replace welch however mcnarney had two competitors for the job robert l nardelli and jeffrey r immelt mcnerney decided to leave ge in late  when it became clear he would not be chosen to replace welch instead immelt was named ges new ceo mcnerney had been heavily recruited by other companies by this time though he had a similar offer from lucent mcnerney decided to leave ge for m or minnesota mining and manufacturing co as chief executive officer and chairman of the board mcnerneys position began january   replacing ld desi desimone who was being forced into mandatory retirement at the age of  m was a  billion technology company which produced a variety of consumer products office supplies health care products safety products electronics telecommunications and industrial products some of its more wellknown goods included postit notes scotch tape scotchguard and thinsulate m had customers in  countries with operations in  of them the hiring of mcnerney by m was considered an unusual move it marked the first time in the companys history that an outsider was selected to run m however it was believed that one reason he was brought aboard was that he fit into the corporate culture at m with a pleasant though determined personality mcnerney was also expected to bring some of ges successdriven corporate culture to m the companies were similar in that they were both quite large and did business in a number of different areas of mcnerney outgoing ceo desimone told josh l dickey of the associated press state  local wire he understands the diverse business circumstances here he has worked internationally and he has a personal style that will fit very very well with m i dont see the hurdles you might expect for a newcomer while m was performing well financially when mcnerney was hired he was expected to help the company get the most value out of its products and assets by improving productivity he wanted to get either get rid of or fix any product lines that were underproducing and control costs across the board mcnerney intended to make ms products number one or number two in their markets eliminate unnecessary management layers and demand more accountability among its employees wall street believed in mcnerney as a leader upon his announcement that he intended to act aggressively as ceo stock prices jumped more than eleven dollars in one day alone mcnerney had a rough first couple of years at m in part because of the poor world economy in  and  as well as the negative effects on business caused by the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   though sales and revenues were down in  especially in ms telecommunication business mcnerney helped control profit loss by cutting costs he eliminated about   jobs limited budgets for office supplies and travel cut inventories and limited accounts receivable by the end of  values of shares had climbed nearly  percent since the announcement that he had been hired mcnerney wanted to improve the culture at m and did so by adding a leadership development center one area of particular concern for some m employees was its research and development rd budget while mcnerney left the billion dollar budget in place he added some uniform performance standards and centralized some operations previously scientists and other researchers were given free rein as they developed new ideas for goods such a loose atmosphere had resulted in the development of many successful products for m mcnerney wanted rd to remain innovative but only focus on products that truly had the potential to make it on the market he also wanted products to reach the market faster and for the scientists to think more like consumers as they came up with their new ideas many m employees generally embraced mcnerneys vision as well as the end result as mcnerney told john s mcclenahen of industry week  retaining our culture of innovation—and in fact nurturing it—is a big part of what i am trying to get done with my team here at m and that directly supports the organic growth of the company mcnerneys reorganization of m paid off while m faced many economic difficulties during his tenure he had the support of wall street analysts who believed that the company which had always been profitable would continue to be so noting the many successes of the healthcare arm of the company he wanted to add more treatments and other products to its line of pharmaceuticals as well as grow the display and graphics division mcnerney hoped to expand m by acquisition but only if the right business became available in  for example he bought the precision lens business of corning for  million in  m posted record sales of  billion and profits of  billion mcnerney was named one of the best managers of  by businessweek and ceo of the year by industry week in  in addition to running m mcnerney served on the board of directors for several companies he joined boeings board in  the  billion company produced commercial and military airplanes and jets as well as defense systems electronic systems missiles satellites information systems and communications systems by  boeing was considering mcnerney as a potential ceo mcnerney was offered the job twice but told the company he was not interested in leaving m however in the spring of  mcnerney had a sudden change of heart he told jeff bailey of the new york times  i realized that the job was about to go away and i realized i did want it and that m could live without me mcnerney left m and joined boeing as its president ceo and chairman of the board in july of  the job mcnerney faced at boeing was similar to that of ms in the beginning the company was already profitable in addition it was generally on the right financial and strategic path in mcnerneys opinion mcnerney had to fix the bureaucracy and a lingering negative corporate culture the last ceo harry stoneciper had been forced out because of ethical questions which also had to be addressed in addition boeing had acquired three companies between  and  which had yet to be fully integrated the move to boeing also allowed mcnerney to return to one of his childhood homes chicago he did not plan to leave boeing before retirement telling dominic gates of the seattle times  i certainly view this as my last job regarding mcnerneys hiring as boeings leader outgoing boeing chairman lewis platt told stanley holmes of businessweek online  jim met all the boards criteria he is in the unanimous judgment of our board members the ideal person to lead boeing jim wins respect for his integrity ethical leadership and personal business style wherever he goes sources periodicals aerospace daily  defense report

outsider to head m in the conglomerates year history his success in this role cemented mcnerneys reputation as one of americas most respected business leaders an executive at general electric since  mcnerney was one of ceo jack welchs leading protégés a star of the highly vaunted ge leadership development system mcnerneys public profile soared in  when he became one of the three contenders in the race to become ceo when welch retired when the position went to jeffrey r immelt mcnerney accepted the offer to move to m w james mcnerney jr apwide world photos  some observers predicted that mcnerneys desire to import ge methods into m would clash with the culture of innovation and independence that was ms hallmark however mcnerneys managerial qualities enabled him to instigate profound changes in the company while largely maintaining the trust of employees mcnerney was widely praised by staff and analysts as a dynamic and effective leader early career mcnerney attended yale university where he was on the baseball team with george w bush and then harvard business school after graduation mcnerneys first position was with procter  gamble a company famous for its consumer products such as pampers disposable diapers and tide laundry detergent at procter  gamble mcnerney worked in brand management for ivory soap he then moved to the management consultancy firm mckinsey  company for four years ge training ground in  mcnerney joined ge as general manager of ge mobile communications over the next  years he held seven positions at ge such movement was typical of the ge leadership development model whereby promising managers moved from job to job every two or three years the aim was to provide managers with diverse experience and exposure by the time mcnerney was named president and ceo of ge aircraft engines in september  it had become obvious to observers that he was being groomed as a possible successor to welch mcnerney developed a reputation as a skilled team builder and proved his ability to grow the businesses with which he was involved at ge in particular during mcnerneys time as ceo at ge aircraft engines revenue increased from  billion the  figure to  billion in  profits increased from  billion to  billion with mcnerney at the helm ge aircraft engines became the second largest profitmaking division in ge behind ge capital a major success during this time was restoration of the relationship between ge and boeing which led to a deal whereby ge engines were supplied to boeing  jets boeing executives cited mcnerneys sincerity focus and decisive handson style as key factors in his success although he likely received many lucrative offers from outside ge mcnerney was committed to staying in the race for the top job outsider at m when immelt was named welchs successor in november  mcnerney and the third candidate robert j nardelli became the most hotly recruited executives in corporate america as a star of the ge system mcnerney faced extreme expectations of success the day mcnerney was named ms next ceo replacing the retiring livio d desimone the price of m shares jumped  percent some observers were skeptical about whether the ge hotshots could perform outside the confines of ge and there were doubts about whether a company as insular as m would accept an outsider m established in  as the minnesota mining and manufacturing company had a long tradition of achieving innovation by allowing its researchers the independence to pursue their projects without interference from management this approach had produced thousands of successful products including household names such as scotch tape scotchguard fabric protector and postit notes m leaders had always been chosen from within the company and were therefore largely committed to protecting the existing company culture in the late s however economic conditions changed although still a sound performer m had been affected by weakening overseas markets which had a negative effect on revenue in particular the – downturn in the asian economies hurt m as did the high value of the us dollar in – the companys share price also slipped as the us stock market came to the end of a year growth period in addition analysts believed that the m leadership lacked dynamism and that the venerable company was underperforming m or e mcnerneys mandate when he arrived at m was to reinvigorate the company in particular he aimed to reestablish the company as a growth venture with doubledigit growth figures whereas m had been achieving approximately  percent mcnerney focused his strategy on initiatives in five key areas sourcing indirect costs eproductivity m acceleration and six sigma mcnerney faced the difficult task of increasing efficiency and discipline in business while not stifling the innovation for which m was famous one of mcnerneys first moves as ceo was to order a global restructuring that cost approximately six thousand jobs approximately  percent of the total workforce because this approach seemed to mirror that of welch infamous for his job cuts at ge there were fears that mcnerney was trying to turn m into e another profound change that raised fears of a ge takeover was mcnerneys drive to implement six sigma into m six sigma was the management method developed at motorola in the early s to eliminate inefficiencies and errors the process was adopted by welch and expanded to all parts of ge mcnerney also imported the ge system of grading employees to identify and reward performance a program quite alien to the m culture in addition mcnerney embarked on a major program of acquisitions as part of the aim of increasing sales growth at m ge had been adept at integrating new business but analysts questioned ms lack of experience in this area a crucial part of mcnerneys strategy was his m acceleration initiative which targeted the research and development culture at m in a company that prided itself on its independent and unconventional research culture this program struck at the heart of the companys values before mcnerneys arrival research and development was spread equally across the various business divisions this style was based on the premise that all divisions should be encouraged to innovate and grow and that great things could arise from the most unprepossessing beginnings the purpose of the acceleration program was to focus resources on projects that looked promising and to cull projects that did not some observers and employees feared that in modifying ms eclectic approach to fostering innovation mcnerney risked destroying the very elements that had made m great managing cultural change from the outset of his tenure as ceo at m mcnerney was careful to emphasize he was trying to improve the existing m culture not replace it with the ge culture in an article in fortune  mcnerney was quoted as saying im not showing up at m with a cultural tool kit that im going to transplant january   several factors in mcnerneys management approach allayed fears of a ge takeover he did not arrive at m with a band of ge executives in tow and instead emphasized the quality of the people already at m as a result m staff accepted the concept that they were the ones driving change many m managers noted that mcnerney instead of dictating changes encouraged the managers to recognize ms assets and identify opportunities some of the staff welcomed the accompanying sense of rejuvenation as one senior employee said in an interview in fortune  hes delivered a very consistent message theres a sense of speed and a sense of urgency august   the ability to clearly communicate his vision for the company and empower his employees was mcnerneys main asset during the initial period of transition at m many observers cited mcnerneys lowkey style and lack of arrogance as important factors in his success in the age of the celebrity ceo mcnerney preferred to avoid the spotlight and instead concentrated on building relationships with those around him at m by the beginning of  mcnerney had moved out of the shadow of welch and ge financial indicators ensured general optimism about the success of mcnerneys strategy at m revenue increased  percent to  billion in  and net income increased  percent to  billion the value of m stock increased  percent over  in late  rumors that mcnerney would head boeing were proved wrong when he announced he would be staying with m business analysts agreed that mcnerneys work at m was not over and most observers remained uncommitted about

jumbo aircraft in boeings forecastthe retirement of older singleaisle and regional jets will drive the majority of aircraft purchases in north america according to a forecast issued yesterday by boeing the manufacturer said that north american carriers – the us and canada – will take delivery of about  new aircraft over the next two decades for a value of usd millionnot surprisingly boeing predicts a decline in demand for regional jets in north america and expects airlines to move to larger turboprops and singleaisle mainliners it cited high fuel prices intensified competition and the superior efficiencies of larger singleaisles as reason for the decline in regional aircraft demand it expects regional aircraft will account for only  or  aircraft of total aircraft investment over the next  years nearly all for replacement the north american fleet will rise from  aircraft today to about  by  with singleaisle aircraft growing from  of the total north american fleet to  of the fleet the main concerns of north american airlines centre on age weight and fuel consumption as well as the impact on climate change large aircraft –  and larger – will not enjoy growing demand in the market with boeing predicting demand for only about  units –  of total investment – all of which will be freighters north america is a large mature market and we expect passenger traffic for the region to grow at a modest rate of  percent said boeing commercial airplanes vice president of marketing randy tinseth who released the forecast in montreal the fastpaced lifestyles in canada and the us require rapid frequent and reliable coasttocoast and interregional transportation driven by this demand nearly threequarters of the new deliveries over the next  years will be singleaisle airplanes tinseth reported the company sees improvement in airline focus on fleet renewal plans small and midsized twinaisle aircraft will constitute  of the fleet by  while twinaisle fleets will continue expanding international pointtopoint services to a wider range of airport pairs and frequencies the company expects demand for  new twin aisles and suggests the sector will account for only  of the total aircraft demand in north america in the next  years however not unexpectedly they will account for  of overall aircraft investment data dumps    freebase api deprecated    google developers
