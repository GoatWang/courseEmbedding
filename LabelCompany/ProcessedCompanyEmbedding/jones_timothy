amazing january   pierre e quality  value  meets expectations  i thoroughly enjoyed reading how we got the bible this book is very informative wellformatted and easy to understand as i was reading i didnt feel weighed down with excessive dates terms and events but i was engaged all the way through i believe how we got the bible should be in every christians list of bookstoread this book would also serve great for historians and even skeptics how we got the bible is definitely not a onetime read and i will be using this book as a reference guide whenever necessary thank you so much timothy jones and rose publishing for this material god bless was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate she  stars out of  how we got the bible by timothy jones april   she quality  value  meets expectations  we are doing this study in a small group very interesting there are scriptures to study with the book material we are really enjoying the study we have people who are very familiar with the bible and some brand new christians who have no knowledge of the scriptures or the history of our bible and we are all learning something highly recommend this study would even work for a new christians class was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate rich from so calif  stars out of  excellent march   rich from so calif quality  value  meets expectations  i was expecting a small response in our mens group for this study instead we ran about  guys they kept coming back for more the study was very well done and even entertaining but the best part was how it gave us more confidence in relying on the scriptures as gods holy word i highly recommend it was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate debbie from

got the bible described how the bible was written copied translated and basically how we got the bible that we use today its written from a conservative protestant viewpoint not only did the author explain how we got the bible but he dealt with some common claims that skeptics make he showed that the bible is trustworthy this book was easy to read and to follow and it used charts to help break down some ideas for quick reference this book is intended for christians who want to know more about the origins of the bible its part of a larger dvd group study on the topic though the book stands on its own it did a good job of giving a solid basic overview of the topics covered christians who wish to debate skeptics on these topics will probably need to read a more indepth book but id recommend this as a relatively quick read for christians who simply want the basics i received this book as an ebook review copy from the publisher was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag

study for protestants october   peacemaker atlanta quality  value  meets expectations  recommended christian history made easy dvd series with leader guide please note this is a review of the session dvd study with printable leader guide fliers  posters pdf not the complete kit edition my recommendation this dvd series is a thorough yet easily understood introduction to christian history which i suggest will fulfill the needs of your individual or protestant group study as well as deepen your faith i noted a few points that do not agree with catholic doctrine but jones did a good job avoiding the trouble spots the included dvd with pdf files for printable leader guide and promotional materials was thorough and easily adaptable for many uses highlights jones knowledge is extensive easy to follow terms clearly indicated on screen when new topics useful info about the transition from oral tradition to written word negativesdistractions for which i will deduct one star from total of five stars  lecturetype gets tiresome but he does a good job of presentation without distractions and pictures and humorous visuals help  i was concerned that dr jones skips the early chapters of the book of acts and begins with acts  and paul what about the earlier church  stephen peter and james  the video and sound were out of sync in one of the cds but i assume i could have exchanged for a quality copy in compliance with the federal trade commission rose publishing provided me with an advanced reader copy with the request that i provide a review positive or negative was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate paul mcmonagle lynchburg va age  gender male  stars out of  fantastic product january   paul mcmonagle lynchburg va age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  as pastor of a small congregation many were wanting to know more of the history between the st century and today as a student who has been through seminary i wanted a concise study that would bridge the gap this study conducted by dr timothy paul jones was exactly what we needed it is an entertaining and informative conservative study on those years the study is broken down in such a way as to give the readerstudent informative and applicable insight into the troubles of the church from the st century to today many resources are recommended during the study to give interested students further recommendations i have graduated from seminary with a ba in biblical studies and a masters of divinity and this study manages to condense this information into  weeks i would highly recommend this to any student needing a refresher and any layperson interested in learning more of how the church came to where she is today great product was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate carly b  stars out of  disappointing june   carly b quality  value  meets expectations  i was so looking forward to using this dvd series with our small group that meets in our home but was sadly disappointed the authorpresenter has an engaging and enjoyable style he comes across as very personable and knowledgeable but he speaks too fast and seems to highlight random events and people in the time period he is covering the result is a largely disjointed presentation the accompanying book an optional purchase provides an outline for notetaking and contains additional information beyond the lecture but even that lacks important events features and people i think the presentation would have been greatly enhanced with even a simple timeline graphic perhaps highlighting the era being covered in each lesson and some kind of explanation even a very brief one of why certain things are covered while others are not for instance the gutenberg press is mentioned very briefly and no mention at all that the first printing was of a bible or why that was an important event in the development of christian thought and practice i had hoped to finish the course with a better understanding of the development of the church overall and the people and events that contributed to that but while there were some interesting things i learned about i didnt get a sense of the whole the rest of our group had the same impression the last two lessons were the most enjoyable with a call to a deeper and more personal commitment to reaching the world with the message of the gospel was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate displaying items  of  page  of  ask a question▼▲ have a question about this product ask us here find related

time to open your eyes to the freeing power of authentic grace—grace that releases us from trying to earn gods favor grace that enables us to rest in the finished work of christ grace that liberates from the tyranny of trying to please others   thats what the theology of martin luther and john calvin did in their own day for the people around them time magazine recently dubbed calvinism as one of the top ten ideas changing the world right now and yet most of these discussions center on the issue of predestination or on whether particular people agree with the five points of calvinism daniel montgomery and timothy paul jones think its time to rescue the theology of the reformers from such stale scholasticizing and to declare anew the dangerous and intoxicating joy of the gospel that they proclaimed   proof stands for planned grace resurrecting grace outrageous grace overcoming grace and forever grace the authors offer proof of god’s grace upon which people can stand against  the attacks of legalism that have led many of gods people to lose sight of the freedom and joy of the gospel  and this proof is intoxicating—it’s like a proof drink that will leave you spiritually staggering at its effect on your life god’s grace not only declares us “not guilty” in his presence it changes our relationship with god—forever available formats ebook nonfiction  paperback
