units in a single computing component die or chip processor base frequency processor base frequency describes the rate at which the processors transistors open and close the processor base frequency is the operating point where tdp is defined frequency is measured in gigahertz ghz or billion cycles per second cache cpu cache is an area of fast memory located on the processor intel® smart cache refers to the architecture that allows all cores to dynamically share access to the last level cache bus speed a bus is a subsystem that transfers data between computer components or between computers types include frontside bus fsb which carries data between the cpu and memory controller hub direct media interface dmi which is a pointtopoint interconnection between an intel integrated memory controller and an intel io controller hub on the computer’s motherboard and quick path interconnect qpi which is a pointtopoint interconnect between the cpu and the integrated memory controller fsb parity fsb parity provides error checking on data sent on the fsb front side bus tdp thermal design power tdp represents the average power in watts the processor dissipates when operating at base frequency with all cores active under an inteldefined highcomplexity workload refer to datasheet for thermal solution requirements vid voltage range vid voltage range is an indicator of the minimum and maximum voltage values at which the processor is designed to operate the processor communicates vid to the vrm voltage regulator module which in turn delivers that correct voltage to the processor

intel® ht technology delivers two processing threads per physical core highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel completing tasks sooner find products with intel® hyperthreading technology ‡ intel® virtualization technology vtx ‡ intel® virtualization technology vtx allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms it offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions intel®  ‡ intel®  architecture delivers bit computing on server workstation desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software¹ intel  architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than  gb of both virtual and physical memory find products with intel®  ‡ instruction set an instruction set refers to the basic set of commands and instructions that a microprocessor understands and can carry out the value shown represents which intel’s instruction set this processor is compatible with enhanced intel speedstep® technology enhanced intel speedstep® technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the powerconservation needs of mobile systems conventional intel speedstep® technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load enhanced intel speedstep® technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as separation between voltage and frequency changes and clock partitioning and recovery intel® demand based switching intel® demand based switching is a powermanagement technology in which the applied voltage and clock speed of a microprocessor are kept at the minimum necessary levels until more processing power is required this technology was introduced as intel speedstep® technology in the server marketplace find products with intel® demand based switching intel® trusted execution technology ‡ intel® trusted execution technology for safer computing is a versatile set of hardware extensions to intel® processors and chipsets that enhance the digital office platform with security capabilities such as measured launch and protected execution it enables an environment where applications can run within their own space protected from all other software on the system find products with intel® trusted execution
