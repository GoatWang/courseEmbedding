customer database in particular our focus on the towable segment of the rv industry and highermargin product and service revenue is driving our operating margin growth and flowing through to our bottom line being the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services protection plans products and resources for rv enthusiasts and operating the largest national network of rvcentric retail

agreement of cwgs llc was amended and restated to among other things i provide for a new single class of common membership interests the common units of cwgs llc and ii exchange all of the thenexisting membership interests in cwgs llc for common units of cwgs llc collectively the “recapitalization” this recapitalization changed the relative membership rights of the owners of membership interests in cwgs llc such that retroactive application of the recapitalization to periods prior to the ipo for the purposes of calculating earnings per share would not be appropriate prior to the ipo the cwgs llc membership structure included membership units preferred units and profits units the company analyzed the calculation of earnings per unit for periods prior to the ipo using the twoclass

generally accepted in the us “gaap” we use the following nongaap financial measures ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share collectively the nongaap financial measures we believe that these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures provide useful information about operating results enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision making these nongaap measures are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the company’s industry the presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap and they should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in these nongaap measures in evaluating these nongaap measures you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of those adjusted in this presentation the nongaap financial measures that we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation ebitda and adjusted ebitda we define “ebitda” as net income before other interest expense excluding floor plan interest expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we define “adjusted ebitda” as ebitda further adjusted for the impact of certain noncash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance these items include among other things loss gain on debt restructure loss gain on sale of assets and disposition of stores gain on derivative instruments monitoring fees equitybased compensation an adjustment to rent on right to use assets and other unusual or onetime items we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the same manner we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these nongaap financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations the following tables reconcile ebitda and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to the most

adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share we define “adjusted pro forma net income” as net income attributable to cwh adjusted for the reallocation of income attributable to

of class a common stock of cwh and further adjusted for the impact of certain noncash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance these items include

directors use the nongaap financial measures as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies and to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business by providing these nongaap financial measures together with reconciliations we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives in addition our new senior secured credit facilities use ebitda to measure our compliance with covenants such as consolidated leverage ratio the nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income and our condensed consolidated balance sheets included in this press release as indicators of financial performance some of the limitations are such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments such measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs some of such measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt some of such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures due to these limitations the nongaap financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using these nongaap financial measures only supplementally as noted in the tables above certain of the nongaap financial measures include adjustments for loss gain on debt repayment loss gain on sale of assets and disposition of stores gain on derivative instruments equitybased compensation an adjustment to rent on right to use assets and other unusual or onetime items it is reasonable to expect that these items will occur in future periods however we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other companies over time in addition these certain nongaap financial measures adjust for other items that we do not expect to regularly record in periods after the ipo including monitoring fees each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation tables above help management with a measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day to day operations view source version on businesswirecom httpwwwbusinesswirecomnewshomeen source camping world holdings inc icrinvestor relationsrachel

communications equipment located in springboro ohio it is also known for its line of equipment for amateur radio and shortwave listening built in the s through the s the company operates as a separate entity owned by blonder tongue laboratories inc contents  history  amateur radio products  long wave medium wave and high frequency hf equipment  very high frequency vhf and ultra high frequency uhf equipment  see also  references  external links historyedit the company was founded in  by radio design engineer robert l drake the company began as a manufacturer of low pass and high pass filters for the government and amateur radio market and after world war ii produced amateur radio transmitters and receivers amateur stations made up of drake gear were used on a number of recordbreaking hot air balloon flights the rms queen mary and the rutan voyager many of the drake receivers transmitters and transceivers manufactured in the s s and s are still in active use today several of the products built in limited quantities are considered very rare when founder robert l drake died in  the operation and management of the company was turned over to his nd son peter w drake today drake produces products and solutions for cable television systems sd and hd video encoders video signal distribution and digital television reception under the drake and dracom brand in february  blonder tongue laboratories inc acquired rl drake llc reportedly for a purchase price of approximately  million however the companies will operate as separate entities blonder tongue in old bridge new jersey and rl drake in miamisburg ohio amateur radio productsedit drake manufactured equipment for amateur radio operators and short wave listeners for more than three decades long wave medium wave and high frequency hf equipmentedit the drake a receiver was the company’s first meant specifically for radio amateurs introduced in  it was revolutionary in at least two ways first it was much smaller than most receivers of the time period the design emphasized simplicity and ease of operation second it was designed specifically for reception of the relatively new and increasingly popular single sideband ssb mode of voice transmission in  they followed the a with the a a more traditional looking receiver that was a bit larger but still much more compact than its contemporaries the a had more features increased sensitivity and selectivity and was introduced at the same price as the a it was followed two years later by the b very similar in appearance but with improved performance and a new set of controls for adjusting the selectivity bandwidth and center frequency drake b radio receiver circa s rather than produce a transmitter to match the b drake designed a new line of equipment beginning with an ssb transceiver the tr in  again emphasizing size efficiency the tr was designed as a complete ssb station in a small package other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator pto capable of extremely linear stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than  khz across all amateur hf shortwave bands its size was so small in part because the power supply was in a separate chassis connected to the transceiver with a multiconductor cable the ac power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet later designated the ms an optional remote vfo pto the rv could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation ie transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency the rv and later the rv also contained a speaker beginning with the tr drake adopted a scheme for illuminating tuning dials and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenishblue transparent plastic filters this lighting color became one of the most recognizable and distinguishing features of drake radios the tr was superseded by several versions of the tr ending with the trc and its variants in  the tr covering the  mhz meter amateur band was also introduced in  and was produced for about six years because of their small size the drake transceivers were widely used for mobile operation along with the dc or dc power supplies in  drake introduced the matching tx transmitter and r receiver the line twins satisfied a desire for high performance operational flexibility and a set of features not possible to squeeze into the tr’s small size the matching units used the same pto technology as the tr and were capable of transceive operation using either the receiver’s or the transmitter’s pto to control the operating frequency drake introduced the t reciter which was a transmitter add on for the r series receivers it had nbo pto of its own and used the pto and other signals from the r receiver to generate the transmit signal making them a two piece transceiver but it saw limited sales and is a rare item on the used ham gear lists these days the line continued to be improved through ‘a’ and ‘b’ versions and underwent a significant receiver redesign when the “cline” came out in  the txc transmitter and rc receiver employed a few more solid state devices but were still primarily vacuum tube designs drake rb receiver circa  along with transceivers and separates the line included a set of matching accessories including the l linear amplifier c control console w and wv power meters transmit and receive converters for the  mhz  meter and  mhz  meter bands and antenna impedance matching networks tuners the mn and mn midway through the line’s run in  drake introduced a receiver and transmitter pair meant for the novice licensee  the c receiver and nt transmitter the c was an improved receiver based on the b design using a few more solid state devices thus it was a sophisticated design compared to most other receivers targeting novices the nt used a crystal oscillator to control its frequency a requirement of the novice license at that time the restriction was later removed by the federal communications commission fcc for short wave listeners drake produced the sw receiver in  and later the swa which matched the rest of the line in appearance was based on the r design but greatly simplified to be easier for the casual listener to use it was replaced in  by the spr a receiver similar in appearance to the rc but again simplified for ease of use its biggest difference however was that it was drake’s first all solid state design it covered a greater portion of the high frequency hf and medium wave spectrum than did the sw by using a large set of selectable heterodyne oscillator crystals for selecting the tuning range each covering a  khz wide segment the receiver came supplied with  crystals and a user could add up to  more in  drake abandoned vacuum tubes except for their use in power amplifiers in favor of solid state designs and digital frequency synthesis the new “line” included the tr transceiver the r receiver and various accessories including two linear amplifiers the l and l the tr largely a solid state version of the tr was built and briefly sold during the early s because so few of them were made they have become comparatively scarce drake’s final entry into the amateur radio and shortwave listening markets was the r receiver in  – a high performance digital design with advanced features specifically meant for shortwave broadcast listening the receiver which primarily covered medium and short wave bands could be expanded to cover two vhf ranges with an optional internal adapter further improvements led to ra and rb models before it was discontinued in  after a long production run very high frequency vhf and ultra high frequency uhf equipmentedit in addition to the converters designed as part of drake’s line they began designing and selling compact vhf and uhf transceivers in the early s powered by v dc they were primarily intended for mobile use drake marketed a series of vhf transceivers manufactured in japan under the drake brand the ml “marker luxury” was a crystal controlled fm transceiver for the meter  mhz band the tr trc and tr were very small meter fm transceivers that were entirely selfcontained including a telescoping antenna and rechargeable battery they each came with a microphone and carrying case with shoulder strap these transceivers were manufactured by triokenwood in japan and marketed worldwide as tr and tr under their manufacturers own brands drake’s uv fm transceiver manufactured in the us covered the   and  mhz bands a different model was available for covering one two or three bands a user could start with one or two and add more later by purchasing modular addin boards it was their first vhfuhf transceiver to use frequency

founded in  by radio design engineer robert l drake the company began as a manufacturer of low pass and high pass filters for the government and amateur radio market and after world war ii produced amateur radio transmitters and receivers amateur stations made up of drake gear were used on a number of recordbreaking hot air balloon flights the rms queen mary and the rutan voyager many of the drake receivers transmitters and transceivers manufactured in the s s and s are still in active use today several of the products built in limited quantities are considered very rare when founder robert l drake died in  the operation and management of the company was turned over to his nd son peter w drake today drake produces products and solutions for cable television systems sd and hd video encoders video signal distribution and digital television reception under the drake and dracom brand in february  blonder tongue laboratories inc acquired rl drake llc reportedly for a purchase price of approximately  million however the companies will operate as separate entities blonder tongue in old bridge new jersey and rl drake in miamisburg ohio amateur radio productsedit drake manufactured equipment for amateur radio operators and short wave listeners for more than three decades long wave medium wave and high frequency hf equipmentedit the drake a receiver was the company’s first meant specifically for radio amateurs introduced in  it was revolutionary in at least two ways first it was much smaller than most receivers of the time period the design emphasized simplicity and ease of operation second it was designed specifically for reception of the relatively new and increasingly popular single sideband ssb mode of voice transmission in  they followed the a with the a a more traditional looking receiver that was a bit larger but still much more compact than its contemporaries the a had more features increased sensitivity and selectivity and was introduced at the same price as the a it was followed two years later by the b very similar in appearance but with improved performance and a new set of controls for adjusting the selectivity bandwidth and center frequency drake b radio receiver circa s rather than produce a transmitter to match the b drake designed a new line of equipment beginning with an ssb transceiver the tr in  again emphasizing size efficiency the tr was designed as a complete ssb station in a small package other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator pto capable of extremely linear stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than  khz across all amateur hf shortwave bands its size was so small in part because the power supply was in a separate chassis connected to the transceiver with a multiconductor cable the ac power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet later designated the ms an optional remote vfo pto the rv could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation ie transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency the rv and later the rv also contained a speaker beginning with the tr drake adopted a scheme for illuminating tuning dials and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenishblue transparent plastic filters this lighting color became one of the most recognizable and distinguishing features of drake radios the tr was superseded by several versions of the tr ending with the trc and its variants in  the tr covering the  mhz meter amateur band was also introduced in  and was produced for about six years because of their small size the drake transceivers were widely used for mobile operation along with the dc or dc power supplies in  drake introduced the matching tx transmitter and r receiver the line twins satisfied a desire for high performance operational flexibility and a set of features not possible to squeeze into the tr’s small size the matching units used the same pto technology as the tr and were capable of transceive operation using either the receiver’s or the transmitter’s pto to control the operating frequency drake introduced the t reciter which was a transmitter add on for the r series receivers it had nbo pto of its own and used the pto and other signals from the r receiver to generate the transmit signal making them a two piece transceiver but it saw limited sales and is a rare item on the used ham gear lists these days the line continued to be improved through ‘a’ and ‘b’ versions and underwent a significant receiver redesign when the “cline” came out in  the txc transmitter and rc receiver employed a few more solid state devices but were still primarily vacuum tube designs drake rb receiver circa  along with transceivers and separates the line included a set of matching accessories including the l linear amplifier c control console w and wv power meters transmit and receive converters for the  mhz  meter and  mhz  meter bands and antenna impedance matching networks tuners the mn and mn midway through the line’s run in  drake introduced a receiver and transmitter pair meant for the novice licensee  the c receiver and nt transmitter the c was an improved receiver based on the b design using a few more solid state devices thus it was a sophisticated design compared to most other receivers targeting novices the nt used a crystal oscillator to control its frequency a requirement of the novice license at that time the restriction was later removed by the federal communications commission fcc for short wave listeners drake produced the sw receiver in  and later the swa which matched the rest of the line in appearance was based on the r design but greatly simplified to be easier for the casual listener to use it was replaced in  by the spr a receiver similar in appearance to the rc but again simplified for ease of use its biggest difference however was that it was drake’s first all solid state design it covered a greater portion of the high frequency hf and medium wave spectrum than did the sw by using a large set of selectable heterodyne oscillator crystals for selecting the tuning range each covering a  khz wide segment the receiver came supplied with  crystals and a user could add up to  more in  drake abandoned vacuum tubes except for their use in power amplifiers in favor of solid state designs and digital frequency synthesis the new “line” included the tr transceiver the r receiver and various accessories including two linear amplifiers the l and l the tr largely a solid state version of the tr was built and briefly sold during the early s because so few of them were made they have become comparatively scarce drake’s final entry into the amateur radio and shortwave listening markets was the r receiver in  – a high performance digital design with advanced features specifically meant for shortwave broadcast listening the receiver which primarily covered medium and short wave bands could be expanded to cover two vhf ranges with an optional internal adapter further improvements led to ra and rb models before it was discontinued in  after a long production run very high frequency vhf and ultra high frequency uhf equipmentedit in addition to the converters designed as part of drake’s line they began designing and selling compact vhf and uhf transceivers in the early s powered by v dc they were primarily intended for mobile use drake marketed a series of vhf transceivers manufactured in japan under the drake brand the ml “marker luxury” was a crystal controlled fm transceiver for the meter  mhz band the tr trc and tr were very small meter fm transceivers that were entirely selfcontained including a telescoping antenna and rechargeable battery they each came with a microphone and carrying case with shoulder strap these transceivers were manufactured by triokenwood in japan and marketed worldwide as tr and tr under their manufacturers own brands drake’s uv fm transceiver manufactured in the us covered the   and  mhz bands a different model was available for covering one two or three bands a user could start with one or two and add more later
