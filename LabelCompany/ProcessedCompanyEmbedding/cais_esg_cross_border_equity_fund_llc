investment outlook the long cycle continues we expect the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in
