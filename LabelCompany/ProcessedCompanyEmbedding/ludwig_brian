doctor i have had the pleasure of working with to try and manage my pain the fact that he is a surgical anesthesiologist as well as a pain management doctor makes him uniquely qualified to understand the mechanisms of a persons pain as he holds the lives of people in surgery in his hands every day and that requires an observant eye to ensure his patient lives through the surgery i have found him to be more observant and hands on than any doctor i have dealt with there use to be a philosophy in medicine you cannot heal with out touching the patient today you go in and office and in most cases the doctor asks how you feel then orders tests leaves and comes back with the test results in my experience the recent trend for doctors to not touch their patients has lead to the mass increase in malpractice lawsuits if more doctors did a complete  minute exam of their patients while offering reassurance that all that could be done would be done there would to a  fold increase in patient satisfaction with there doctors there are so many things you can tell about a patient by doing a quick check of the general condition of the patient will instilling in them the feeling that they matter enough for you to touch them and see if you can find if there is anything that may have been missed in your telling of how you feel the reduction in unnecessary tests and misdiagnoses would drop dramatically dr hua is just such a man and he instills confidence that he has done all he can to take care of youdr quyen luu mdflor de maria v ratedi was writing a review but sometime happened

appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom

the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback microsoft personalized ad
