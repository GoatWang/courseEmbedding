free energy the gibbs function  free energy and chemical change physical meaning of free energy the important role of temperature the maximum work  the standard gibbs free energy what do we mean by standard defining δg° and δgf°  dont confuse δg and δg°  interpretation of δg° values some example processes finding the equilibrium temperature understanding plots of δh° and tδs°  some remarks about free energy gibbs energy of dilution and mixing summary of key concepts concept map in this unit we introduce a new thermodynamic function the free energy which turns out to be the single most useful criterion for predicting the direction of a chemical reaction and the composition of the system at equilibrium as we will explain near the bottom of this page the term free energy although still widely used is rather misleading so we will ofen refer to it as the gibbs function or gibbs energy   in the previous lesson we saw that it is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and surroundings that determines whether a process will occur spontaneously in chemical thermodynamics we prefer to focus our attention on the system rather than the surroundings and would like to avoid having to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings explicity the free energy enables us to do this for changes that occur at a constant temperature and pressure the gibbs free energy or constant temperature and volume the helmholtz free energy image source we will deal only with the gibbs free energy in this course the helmholtz free energy is of interest mainly to chemical engineers whose industrialscale processes are often confined to tanks and reactors of fixed volume and some geochemists whose interest is centered on the chemistry that occurs deep within the earths surface  free energy the gibbs function the gibbs free energy also known as the gibbs function is defined as g  h – t s in which s refers to the entropy of the system since h t and s are all state functions so is g thus for any change in state we can write the extremely important relation δg  δh – t δs must know this how does this simple equation encompass the entropy change of the world δstotal which we already know is the sole criterion for spontaneous change starting with the definition δstotal  δssurr  δssys we would first like to get rid of δssurr how can a chemical reaction a change in the system affect the entropy of the surroundings because most reactions are either exothermic or endothermic they are accompanied by a flow of heat qp across the system boundary the enthalpy change of the reaction δh is defined as the flow of heat into the system from the surroundings when the reaction is carried out at constant pressure so the heat withdrawn from the surroundings will be –qp which will cause the entropy of the surroundings to change by –qp  t  –δht we can therefore rewrite eq  as δstotal  – δht  δssys  multiplying through by t  we obtain –t δstotal  δh – t δssys which expresses the entropy change of the world in terms of thermodynamic properties of the system exclusively if tδstotal is denoted by δg then we have eq  which defines the gibbs free energy change for the process some textbooks and teachers say that the free energy and thus the spontaniety of a reaction depends on both the enthalpy and entropy changes of a reaction and they sometimes even refer to reactions as energy driven or entropy driven depending on whether δh or the tδs term dominatesthis is technically correct but misleading because it disguises the important fact that δstotal which this equation expresses in an indirect way is the only criterion of spontaneous change from the foregoing you should convince yourself that g will decrease in any process occurring at constant temperature and pressure which is accompanied by an overall increase in the entropy the constant temperature is a consequence of the temperature and the enthalpy appearing in the preceding equation  since most chemical and phase changes of interest to chemists take place under such conditions the gibbs energy is the most useful of all the thermodynamic properties of a substance and as we shall see in the lesson that follows this one it is closely linked to the equilibrium constant   gibbs energy and chemical change δg determines the direction and extent of chemical change please remember that δg is meaningful only for changes in which the temperature and pressure remain constant these are the conditions under which most reactions are carried out in the laboratory the system is usually open to the atmosphere constant pressure and we begin and end the process at room temperature after any heat we have added or which is liberated by the reaction has dissipated the importance of the gibbs function can hardly be overstated it serves as the single master variable that determines whether a given chemical change is thermodynamically possible thus if the free energy of the reactants is greater than that of the products the entropy of the world will increase when the reaction takes place as written and so the reaction will tend to take place spontaneously conversely if the free energy of the products exceeds that of the reactants then the reaction will not take place in the direction written but it will tend to proceed in the reverse direction in a spontaneous change gibbs energy always decreases and never increases this of course reflects the fact that the entropy of the world behaves in the exact opposite way owing to the negative sign in the tδs term recalling the example of the freezing of water we presented in the previous lesson holiquid → ho ice water below its freezing point undergoes a decrease in its entropy but the heat released into the surroundings more than compensates for this so the entropy of the world increases the free energy of the ho diminishes and the process proceeds spontaneously an important consequence of the oneway downward path of the free energy is that once it reaches its minimum possible value net change comes to a halt this of course represents the state of chemical equilbrium these relations are nicely summarized as follows δg   reaction can spontaneously proceed to the right   a → b δg   reaction can spontaneously proceed to the left   a ← b δg   the reaction is at equilibrium the quantities of a and b will not change finding the value of δg dont bother this might seem strange given the key importance δg in determining whether or not a reaction will take place in a given direction it turns out however that it is almost never necessary to explicitly evaluate δg as we will show in the lesson that follows this one it is far more convenient to work with the equilibrium constant of a reaction within which δg is hidden this is just as well because for most reactions those that take place in solutions or gas mixtures the value of δg depends on the proportions of the various reaction components in the mixture it is not a simple sum of the products minus reactants type as is the case with δh more on this in the next lesson the important role of temperature recalling the condition for spontaneous change δg  δh  tδs   it is apparent that the temperature dependence of δg depends almost entirely on the entropy change associated with the process we say almost because the values of δh and δs are themselves slightly temperature dependent both gradually increase with temperature in particular notice that in the above equation the sign of the entropy change determines whether the reaction becomes more or less spontaneous as the temperature is raised for any given reaction the sign of δh can also be positive or negative this means that there are four possibilities for the influence that temperature can have on the spontaniety of a process   case  δh   and δs     under these conditions both the δh and tδs terms will be negative so δg will be negative regardless of the temperature anexothermic reaction whose entropy increases will be spontaneous at all temperatures         case  δh   and δs   if the reaction is sufficiently exothermic it can force δg negative only at temperatures below which tδs  δh this means that there is a temperature t  δh  δs at which the reaction is at equilibrium the reaction will only proceed spontaneously below this temperature the freezing of a liquid or the condensation of a gas are the most common examples of this condition   case  δh   and δs   this is the reverse of the previous case the entropy increase must overcome the handicap of an endothermic process so that tδs  δh since the effect of the temperature is to magnify the influence of a positive δs the process will be spontaneous at temperatures above t  δh  δs think of melting and boiling       case  δh   and δs   with both δh and δs working against it this kind of process will not proceed spontaneously at any temperature substance a always has a greater number of accessible energy states and is therefore always the preferred form       about the above diagrams the plots on the left are the important ones dont try to memorize them but make sure you understand and can explain or reproduce them for a given set of δh and δs their most important differentiating features are the position of the δh line above or below the is tδs line and the slope of the latter which of course depends on the sign of δs the reaction a → b will occur spontaneously only when δg is negative blue arrows pointing down owing to the slight temperature dependence of δs the tδs plots are not quite straight lines as shown here similarly the lines representing δh are even more curved the other two plots on each diagram are only for the chemistrycommitted each pair of energylevel diagrams depicts the relative spacing of the microscopic energy levels in the reactants and products as reflected by the value of δs° the greater the entropy the more closelyspaced are the quantized microstates the red shading indicates the range of energy levels that are accessible to the system at each temperature the spontaneous direction of the reaction will always be in the direction in which the red shading overlaps the greater number of energy levels resulting in the maximum dispersal of thermal energy note that the vertical offsets correspond to δh° for the reaction never forget that it is the ability of thermal energy to spread into as many of these states as possible that determines the tendency of the process to take place none of this is to scale of course the maximum work as we explained in part  the two quantities qrev qmin and wmax associated with reversible processes are state functions we gave the quotient qrev t a new name the entropy what we did not say is that wmax also corresponds to the free energy the gibbs energy is the maximum useful work excluding pv work associated with volume changes of the system that a system can do on the surroundings when the process occurs reversibly at constant temperature and pressure this work is done at the expense of the internal energy of the system and whatever part of that is not extracted as work is exchanged with the surroundings as heat this latter quantity will have the value tδs  why is this important recall that many chemical reactions such as those that take place when a battery is discharged can be made to force electrons to flow through an external circuit thus producing electrical work   the standard gibbs free energy reminder what do we mean by standard you have already been introduced to the terms such as δu° and δh° in which the ° sign indicates that all components reactants and products are in their standard states this concept of standard states is especially important in the case of the free energy so lets take a few moments to review it more exact definitions of the conventional standard states can be found in most physical chemistry textbooks see also this short wikipedia article in specialized fields such as biochemistry and oceanography alternative definitions may apply for example the standard ph of zero corresponding to   m is impractical in biochemistry there is not much bio going on at ph  so ph   is commonly employed for most practical purposes and certainly for this course the following definitions are good enough gases  atmosphere partial pressure pure liquids the liquid under a total hydrostatic pressure of  atm solutes an effective concentration of  mol l–  mol dm– effective concentrations approach real concentrations as the latter approach zero for practical purposes these can be considered identical at real concentrations smaller than about – molar solids the pure solid under  atm pressure note also that there is actually no standard temperature but because most thermodynamics tables list values for  k ° c this temperature is usually implied these same definitions apply to standard enthalpies and internal energies dont confuse these thermodynamic standard states with the standard temperature and pressure stp widely employed in gas law calculations defining δg° and δgf° in order to make use of gibbs energies to predict chemical changes we need to know the free energies of the individual components of the reaction for this purpose we can combine the standard enthalpy of formation and the standard entropy of a substance to get its standard free energy of formation δgf°  δhf°  tδsf° recall that the symbol ° refers to the standard state of a substance measured under the conditions of  atm pressure or an effective concentration of  mol l– and a temperature of k and then determine the standard gibbs energy of the reaction according to δg°  σ δgf°products σ δgf°reactants must know this as with standard heats of formation the standard free energy of a substance represents the free energy change associated with the formation of the substance from the elements in their most stable forms as they exist under the standard conditions of  atm pressure and k standard gibbs free energies of formation are normally found directly from tables once the values for all the reactants and products are known the standard gibbs free energy change for the reaction is found by eq  most tables of thermodynamic values list δgf°s for common substances they can of course always be found from values of δhf° and δsf° problem example  find the standard gibbs energy change for the reaction cacos → caos cog the δgf° values for the three components of this reaction system are cacos – kj mol– caos – kj mol– cog – kj mol– solution substituting into eq  we have δg°  – – – – kj mol–   kj mol– indicating that the process is not spontaneous under standard conditions ie solid calcium carbone will not form solid calcium oxide and co at  atm partial pressure at ° c comment this reaction is carried out on a huge scale to manufacture cement so it is obvious that the process can be spontaneous under different conditions   the practical importance of the gibbs energy is that it allows us to make predictions based on the properties δg° values of the reactants and products themselves eliminating the need to experiment but bear in mind that while thermodynamics always correctly predicts whether a given process can take place is spontaneous in the thermodynamic sense it is unable to tell us if it will take place at an observable rate when thermodynamics says no it means exactly that when it says yes it means maybe   problem example  the reaction ½ og  hg → hol is used in fuel cells to produce an electrical current the reaction can also be carried out by direct combustion thermodynamic data molar entropies in j mol– k– og  hg hol  hol δh°f  – kj mol– use this information to find a the amount of heat released when the reaction takes place by direct combustion b the amount of electrical work the same reaction can perform when carried out in a fuel cell at k under reversible condtions c the amount of heat released under the same conditions solution first we need to find δh° and δs° for the process recalling that the standard enthalpy of formation of the elements is zero δh°  δh°fproducts – δh°freactants  – kj mol– –   – kj mol– similarly δs°  s°fproducts – s°freactants   – ½×    – j k–mol– a when the hydrogen and oxygen are combined directly the heat released will be δh°  – kj mol– b the maximum electrical work the fuel cell can perform is given by δg°  δh° – tδs°   – kj mol– –  k– jk–mol–  –  kj mol– c the heat released in the fuel cell reaction is the difference between the enthalpy change the total energy available and the reversible work that was expended δh° – δg° tδs°    k– jk–mol–  – j mol–  – kj mol– in this reaction  moles of gas disappear to be replaced by  ml  mole of water the system undergoes a marked contraction in which the atmosphere performs pressurevolume work on the system but this pv work is the nonuseful work that is not included in the δg value the foregoing example illustrates an important advantage of fuel cells although direct combustion of a mole of hydrogen gas yields more energy than is produced by the same net reaction within the fuel cell the latter in the form of electrical energy can be utilized at nearly percent energy efficiency by a motor or some other electrical device if the thermal energy released by direct combustion were supplied to a heat engine secondlaw considerations would require that at least half of this energy be wasted to the surroundings   δg and δg° whats the difference the apparent similarity of the terms δg δg° and δgf° makes it easy to overlook the distinctions between them and is a major source of confusion and error for students and sometimes even for teachers although these terms were discussed above it might be useful to summarize and expand upon these distinctions the most important thing to remember is that the terms δg° and δgf° refer to single specific chemical changes in which all components reactants and products are in their standard states standard gibbs energies of formation the δgf° of a substance like δhf° refers to the reaction in which that substance is formed from the elements as they exist in their most stable forms at  atm pressure and usually k both of these δ terms are by definition zero for the elements in their standard states there are only a few common cases in which this might create some ambiguity   stable form example δgf° kj mol– og og  δgf°   cgraphite cdiamond   δgf°   srhombic smonoclinic δgf°   pwhite ps δgf°   ions in aqueous solution are a special case their standard free energies are relative to the hydrated hydrogen ion haq which is assigned δgf°     plainvanilla δg is very different from δg°  the distinction is nicely illustrated in this diagram in which δg is plotted on a vertical axis for two hypothetical reactions having opposite signs of δg° the horizontal axis schematically expresses the relative concentrations of reactants and products at any point of the process note that the origin corresponds to the composition at which half of the reactants have been converted into products   take careful note of the following the red line on the left plots the values of δg for the δg°   reaction notice that there are an infinite number of these values depending on the progress of the reaction in contrast there is only a single value of δg° corresponding to the composition at which δg    at this point some products have been formed but the composition is still dominated by reactants if we begin at a composition to the left of  δg will be negative and the composition will move to the right similarly if we begin with a composition to the right of  δg will be positive and the composition will move to the left the plot on the right is for the δg°   reaction for which δg° is shown at  at its equilibrium point  there are more products than reactants if we start at a composition to the right of  the composition will tend to move to the left if the initial composition is to the left of  the reaction will tend to proceed to the right what would happen if δg° were  the equilibrium point of such a reaction would be at the origin corresponding to half the reactants being converted to products the important principle you should understand from this is that a negative δg° does not mean that the reactants will be completely transformed into products by the same token a positive δg° does not mean that no products are formed at all   it should now be clear from the discussion above that a given reaction carried out under standard conditions is characterized by a single value of δg° the reason for the gibbs energy minimum at equilibrium relates to the increase in entropy when products and reactants coexist in the same phase as seen in the plot even a minute amount of contamination of products by reactants reduces the free energy below that of the pure products for more on the entropy and gibbs energy of mixing see here in contrast composition of a chemical reaction system undergoes continual change until the equilibrium state is reached so the a single reaction can have an infinite number of δg values reflecting the infinite possible compositions between the extremes of pure reactants zero extent of reaction and pure products unity extent of reaction in the example of a reaction a → b depicted in the above diagram the standard free energy of the products is smaller than that of the reactants  so the reaction will take place spontaneously but as will be explained in the next lesson this does not mean that each mole of pure a will be converted into one mole of pure b for reactions in which products and reactants occupy a single phase gas or solution the meaning of spontaneous is that the equilibrium composition will correspond to an extent of reaction greater than  but smaller than unity note however that for δg° values in excess of about ± kj mol– the equilibrium composition will be negligibly different from zero or unity extentofreaction the physical meaning of δg is that it tells us how far the free energy of the system has changed from g° of the pure reactants  as the reaction proceeds to the right the composition changes and δg begins to fall when the composition reaches  δg reaches its minimum value and further reaction would cause it to rise but because free energy can only decrease but never increase this does not happen the composition of the system remains permanently at its equilibrium value a g vs extentofreaction diagram for a nonspontaneous reaction can be interpreted in a similar way the equilibrium composition will correspond to an extent of reaction greater than zero but less than  in this case the minimum at reflects the increase in entropy when the reactants are contaminated by a small quantity of products   if all this detail about δg seems a bit overwhelming dont worry it all gets hidden in the equilibrium constant and reaction quotient that we discuss in the next lesson   interpretation of standard gibbs energy changes some example processes although it is δg rather than δg° that serves as a criterion for spontaneous change at constant temperature and pressure δg° values are so readily available that they are often used to get a rough idea of whether a given chemical change is possible this is practical to do in some cases but not in others it generally works for reactions such as  nhg  og→  nog  hog      δg°  – kj industrially important for the manufacture of nitric acid because δg° is so negative that the reaction will be spontaneous and virtually complete under just about any reasonable set of conditions the following reaction expresses the fact that the water molecule is thermodynamically stable  hg ½ og→ hog       δg°  – kj note that this refers to liquid water the standard state of ho at ° if you think about it a negative standard gibbs energy of formation of which this is an example can in fact be considered a definition of molecular stability similarly dissociation of dihydrogen into its atoms is highly unlikely under standard conditions hog→  hg og       δg°   kj again an analogous situation would apply to any stable molecule now consider the dissociation of dinitrogen tetroxide nog→  nog       δg°   kj in which the positive value of δg° tells us that no at  atm pressure will not change into two moles of no at the same pressure but owing to the small absolute value of δg° we can expect the spontaneity of the process to be quite sensitive to both the temperature as shown in the table below and to the pressure in exactly the way the le châtelier principle predicts for reactions involving dissolved ions one has to be quite careful thus for the dissociation of the weak hydrofluoric acid hfaq → haq  f–aq      δg°  – kj   it is clear that a  moll solution of hf will not dissociate into m ions but this fact is not very useful because if the hf is added to water the initial concentration of the fluoride ion will be zero and that of h very close to zero and the le châtelier principle again predicts that some dissociation will be spontaneous it is common knowledge that dissociation of water into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions occurs only very sparingly hol → haq  oh–aq      δg°   kj   which correctly predicts that the water will not form m effective concentration of the ions but this is hardly news if you already know that the product of these ion concentrations can never exceed – at k finally consider this most familiar of all phase change processes the vaporization of liquid water hol→ hog     δg°   kj  for more on the vapor pressure of water and relative humidity see here conversion of liquid water to its vapor at  atm partial pressure does not take place at ° c at which temperature the equiibrium partial pressure of the vapor the vapor pressure is only  atm  torr gaseous ho at a pressure of  atm can only exist at ° c of course water left in an open container at room temperature will spontaneously evaporate if the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is less than  atm corresponding to a relative humidity of under  finding the equilibrium temperature a reaction is in its equilibrium state when δg  δh  tδs   the temperature at which this occurs is given by t  δh  tδs  if we approximate δh by δh° and δs by δs° we can estimate the normal boiling point of a liquid from the following thermodynamic data for water caution because δh° values are normally expressed in kilojoules while δs° is given in joules a very common student error is to overlook the need to express both in the same units we find that liquid water is in equilibrium with water vapor at a partial pressure of  atm when the temperature is t   j   j k–   k but the normal boiling point of water is  k you say very true the reason we are off here is that both δh ° and δs ° have their own temperature dependencies we are using the standard ° values without correcting them to ° c nevertheless if you think about it the fact that we can estimate the boiling point of a liquid from a table of thermodynamic data should be rather impressive of course the farther one gets from k the more unreliable will be the result thus for the dissociation of dihydrogen into its atoms t   j   j k–   k all one can say here is that h will break down at somethng over k or so you may already know that all molecules will dissociate into their atoms at high temperatures   we tend to think of high temperatures as somehow forcing molecules to dissociate into their atoms but this is wrong in order to get the h–h bond to vibrate so violently through purely thermal excitation that the atoms would fly apart a temperature more like k would be required the proper interpretation is at the temperature corresponding to δhtδs the molecule spontaneously absorbs energy from the surroundings sufficient to overcome the hh bond strength predicting the effects of temperature in a previous section of this lesson we described the role of temperature in the gibbs function showed plots that explain how the sign of the tδs term interacts with that of δh to determine whether the reaction can take place at a given temperature this can be more clearly understood by examining plots of tδs° and δh° as functions of the temperature for some actual reactions of course these parameters refer to standard states that generally do not correspond to the temperatures pressures or concentrations that might be of interest in an actual case nevertheless these quantities are easily found and they can usefully predict the way that temperature affects these systems   exothermic reaction δs°     cgraphite  og→ cog δh°   kj δs°   j k δg°   kj at  k this combustion reaction like most such reactions is spontaneous at all temperatures the positive entropy change is due mainly to the greater mass of co molecules compared to those of o exothermic reaction δs°    h  n →  nhg δh°   kj δs°   j k δg°   kj at  k the decrease in moles of gas in the haber ammonia synthesis drives the entropy change negative making the reaction spontaneous only at low temperatures thus higher t which speeds up the reaction also reduces its extent endothermic reaction δs°   nog→  nog δh°   kj δs°   j k δg°   kj at  k dissociation reactions are typically endothermic with positive entropy change and are therefore spontaneous at high temperatures ultimately all molecules decompose to their atoms at sufficiently high temperatures endothermic reaction δs°   ½ n  o → nog δh°   kj δs°   j k– δg°   kj at  k this reaction is not spontaneous at any temperature meaning that its reverse is always spontaneous but because the reverse reaction is kinetically inhibited no can exist indefinitely at ordinary temperatures even though it is thermodynamically unstable     some remarks on the gibbs free energy free energy is it free is it energy is it real its not necessarily free the appellation free energy for g has led to so much confusion that many scientists now refer to it simply as the gibbs energy the free part of the older name reflects the steamengine origins of thermodynamics with its interest in converting heat into work δg is the maximum amount of energy which can be freed from the system to perform useful work by useful we mean work other than that which is associated with the expansion of the system this is most commonly in the form of electrical work moving electric charge through a potential difference but other forms of work osmotic work increase in surface area are also possible its not energy a much more serious difficulty with the gibbs function particularly in the context of chemistry is that although g has the units of energy joules or in its intensive form j mol it lacks one of the most important attributes of energy in that it is not conserved thus although the free energy always falls when a gas expands or a chemical reaction takes place spontaneously there need be no compensating increase in energy anywhere else referring to g as an energy also reinforces the false but widespread notion that a fall in energy must accompany any change but if we accept that energy is conserved it is apparent that the only necessary condition for change whether the dropping of a weight expansion of a gas or a chemical reaction is the redistribution of energy the quantity δg associated with a process represents the quantity of energy that is shared and spread which as we have already explained is the meaning of the increase in the entropy the quotient δgt is in fact identical with δstotal the entropy change of the world whose increase is the primary criterion for any kind of change its not even real g differs from the thermodynamic quantities h and s in another significant way it has no physical reality as a property of matter whereas h and s can be related to the quantity and distribution of energy in a collection of molecules the free energy is simply a useful construct that serves as a criterion for change and makes calculations easier who

normally covered in elementary chemistry courses so unless you are enrolled in a universitylevel honors course which makes explicit reference to this topic you can safely skip it that having been said this additional matierial is a natural extension of what is presented above and leads to a more complete understanding of chemical equilibrium it is presented in a way that emphasizes the basic concepts and avoids the mathematical rigor of the standard physical chemistry treatment   summary of key concepts you are expected to be able to define and explain the significance of terms identified in green type the gibbs free energy is a state function defined as g  h  ts  the gibbs energy is the maximum useful work that a system can do on the surroundings when the process occurs reversibly at constant temperature and pressure the practical utility of the gibbs function is that δg for any process is negative if it leads to an increase in the entropy of the world thus spontaneous change at a given temperature and pressure can only occur when it would lead to a decrease in g the sign of the standard free energy change δg° of a chemical reaction determines whether the reaction will tend to proceed in the forward or reverse direction similarly the relative signs of δg° and δs° determine whether the spontaniety of a chemical reaction will be affected by the temperature and if so in what way the existence of sharp melting and boiling points reflects the differing temperature dependancies of the free energies of the solid liquid and vapor phases of a pure substance which are in turn reflect their differing entropies concept map   ⇐index  spontaneous change  entropy  second law  free energy   equilibrium  applications    by stephen lower  last modified  for information about this

increase in the disorder of the system s   calculations of h and s can be used to probe the driving force behind a particular reaction practice problem calculate h and s  for the following reaction and decide in which direction each of these factors will drive the reaction ng   hg  nhg click here to check your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem  what happens when one of the potential driving forces behind a chemical reaction is favorable and the other is not we can answer this question by defining a new quantity known as the gibbs free energy g of the system which reflects the balance between these forces the gibbs free energy of a system at any moment in time is defined as the enthalpy of the system minus the product of the temperature times the entropy of the system g  h  ts the gibbs free energy of the system is a state function because it is defined in terms of thermodynamic properties that are state functions the change in the gibbs free energy of the system that occurs during a reaction is therefore equal to the change in the enthalpy of the system minus the change in the product of the temperature times the entropy of the system g  h  ts if the reaction is run at constant temperature this equation can be written as follows g  h  ts the change in the free energy of a system that occurs during a reaction can be measured under any set of conditions if the data are collected under standardstate conditions the result is the standardstate free energy of reaction go go  ho  tso the beauty of the equation defining the free energy of a system is its ability to determine the relative importance of the enthalpy and entropy terms as driving forces behind a particular reaction the change in the free energy of the system that occurs during a reaction measures the balance between the two driving forces that determine whether a reaction is spontaneous as we have seen the enthalpy and entropy terms have different sign conventions favorable unfavorable ho   ho   so   so   the entropy term is therefore subtracted from the enthalpy term when calculating go for a reaction because of the way the free energy of the system is defined go is negative for any reaction for which ho is negative and so is positive go is therefore negative for any reaction that is favored by both the enthalpy and entropy terms we can therefore conclude that any reaction for which go is negative should be favorable or spontaneous favorable or spontaneous reactions go   conversely go is positive for any reaction for which ho is positive and so is negative any reaction for which go is positive is therefore unfavorable unfavorable or nonspontaneous reactions go   reactions are classified as either exothermic h   or endothermic h   on the basis of whether they give off or absorb heat reactions can also be classified as exergonic g   or endergonic g   on the basis of whether the free energy of the system decreases or increases during the reaction when a reaction is favored by both enthalpy ho   and entropy so   there is no need to calculate the value of go to decide whether the reaction should proceed the same can be said for reactions favored by neither enthalpy ho   nor entropy so   free energy calculations become important for reactions favored by only one of these factors practice problem calculate h and s

at room temperature click here to check your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem  the effect of temperature on the free energy of a reaction the balance between the contributions from the enthalpy and entropy terms to the free energy of a reaction depends on the temperature at which the reaction is run practice problem use the values of  h and s calculated in practice problem  to predict whether the following reaction is spontaneous at c ng   hg  nhg click here to check your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem  the equation used to define free energy suggests that the entropy term will become more important as the temperature increases go  ho  tso since the entropy term is unfavorable the reaction should become less favorable as the temperature increases practice problem predict whether the following reaction is still spontaneous at c ng   hg  nhg assume that the values of  ho and s used in practice problem  are still valid at this temperature click here to check your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem  standardstate free energies of reaction go for a reaction can be calculated from tabulated standardstate free energy data since there is no absolute zero on the freeenergy scale the easiest way to tabulate such data is in terms of standardstate free energies of formation gfo as might be expected the standardstate free energy of formation of a substance is the difference between the free energy of the substance and the free energies of its elements in their thermodynamically most stable states at  atm all measurements being made under standardstate conditions interpreting standardstate free energy of reaction data we are now ready to ask the obvious question what does the value of go tell us about the following reaction ng   hg  nhg go   kj by definition the value of go for a reaction measures the difference between the free energies of the reactants and products when all components of the reaction are present at standardstate conditions go therefore describes this reaction only when all three components are present at  atm pressure the sign of go tells us the direction in which the reaction has to shift to come to equilibrium the fact that go is negative for this reaction at oc means that a system under standardstate conditions at this temperature would have to shift to the right converting some of the reactants into products before it can reach equilibrium the magnitude of go for a reaction tells us how far the standard state is from equilibrium the larger the value of go the further the reaction has to go to get to from the standardstate conditions to equilibrium assume for example that we start with the following reaction under standardstate conditions as shown in the figure below ng   hg  nhg the value of g at that moment in time will be equal to the standardstate free energy for this reaction go when qp   g  go as the reaction gradually shifts to the right converting n and h into nh the value of g for the reaction will decrease if we could find some way to harness the tendency of this reaction to come to equilibrium we could get the reaction to do work the free energy of a reaction at any moment in time is therefore said to be a measure of the energy available to do work the relationship between free energy and equilibrium constants when a reaction leaves the standard state because of a change in the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants we have to describe the system in terms of nonstandardstate free energies of reaction the difference between go and g for a reaction is important there is only one value of go for a reaction at a given temperature but there are an infinite number of possible values of g the figure below shows the relationship between g for the following reaction and the logarithm to the base e of the reaction quotient for the reaction between n and h to form nh ng   hg  nhg data on the left side of this figure correspond to relatively small values of qp they therefore describe systems in which there is far more reactant than product the sign of g for these systems is negative and the magnitude of g is large the system is therefore relatively far from equilibrium and the reaction must shift to the right to reach equilibrium data on the far right side of this figure describe systems in which there is more product than reactant the sign of g is now positive and the magnitude of g is moderately large the sign of g tells us that the reaction would have to shift to the left to reach equilibrium the magnitude of g tells us that we dont have quite as far to go to reach equilibrium the points at which the straight line in the above figure cross the horizontal and versus axes of this diagram are particularly important the straight line crosses the vertical axis when the reaction quotient for the system is equal to  this point therefore describes the standardstate conditions and the value of g at this point is equal to the standardstate free energy of reaction go when qp   g  go the point at which the straight line crosses the horizontal axis describes a system for which g is equal to zero because there is no driving force behind the reaction the system must be at equilibrium when qp  kp g   the relationship between the free energy of reaction at any moment in time g and the standardstate free energy of reaction go is described by the following equation g  go  rt ln q in this equation r is the ideal gas constant in units of jmolk t is the temperature in kelvin ln represents a logarithm to the base e and q is the reaction quotient at that moment in time as we have seen the driving force behind a chemical reaction is zero g   when the reaction is at equilibrium q  k   go  rt ln k we can therefore solve this equation for the relationship between go and k go   rt ln k this equation allows us to calculate the equilibrium constant for any reaction from the standardstate free energy of reaction or vice versa the key to understanding the relationship between go and k is recognizing that the magnitude of go tells us how far the standardstate is from equilibrium the smaller the value of go the closer the standardstate is to equilibrium the larger the value of go the further the reaction has to go to reach equilibrium the relationship between go and the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction is illustrated by the data in the table below values of go and k

your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem  the equilibrium constant for a reaction can be expressed in two ways kc and kp we can write equilibrium constant expressions in terms of the partial pressures of the reactants and products or in terms of their concentrations in units of moles per liter for gasphase reactions the equilibrium constant obtained from go is based on the partial pressures of the gases kp for reactions in solution the equilibrium constant that comes from the calculation is based on concentrations kc practice problem use the

constants equilibrium constants are not strictly constant because they change with temperature we are now ready to understand why the standardstate free energy of reaction is a measure of how far the standardstate is from equilibrium go   rt ln k but the magnitude of go depends on the temperature of the reaction go  ho  tso as a result the equilibrium constant must depend on the temperature of the reaction a good example of this phenomenon is the reaction in which no dimerizes to form no  nog nog this reaction is favored by enthalpy because it forms a new bond which makes the system more stable the reaction is not favored by entropy because it leads to a decrease in the disorder of the system no is a brown gas and no is colorless we can therefore monitor the extent to which no dimerizes to form no by examining the intensity of the brown color in a sealed tube of this gas what should happen to the equilibrium between no and no as the temperature is lowered for the sake of argument lets assume that there is no significant change in either  ho or so as the system is cooled the contribution to the free energy of the reaction from the enthalpy term is therefore constant but the contribution from the entropy term becomes smaller as the temperature is lowered go  ho  tso as the tube is cooled and the entropy term becomes less important the net effect is a shift in the equilibrium toward the right the figure below shows what happens to the intensity of the brown color when a sealed tube containing no gas is immersed in liquid nitrogen there is a drastic decrease in the amount of no in the tube as it is cooled to oc practice problem use values of  ho and sofor the following reaction at c to estimate the equilibrium constant for this reaction at the temperature of boiling water c icec a dry iceacetone bath c and liquid nitrogen c  nog  nog click here to check your answer to practice problem  click here to see a solution to practice problem    the relationship between free energy and cell potentials the value of g for a reaction at any moment in time tells us two things the sign of g tells us in what direction the reaction has to shift to reach equilibrium the magnitude of g tells us how far the reaction is from equilibrium at that moment the potential of an electrochemical cell is a measure of how far an oxidationreduction reaction is from equilibrium the nernst equation describes the relationship between the cell potential at any moment in time and the standardstate cell potential lets rearrange this equation as follows nfe  nfeo  rt ln q we can now compare it with the equation used to describe the relationship between the free energy of reaction at any moment in time and the standardstate free energy of reaction g  go  rt ln q these equations are similar because the nernst equation is a special case of the more general free energy relationship we can convert one of these equations to the other by taking advantage of the following relationships between the free energy of a reaction and the cell potential of the reaction when it is run as an electrochemical cell g  nfe practice problem use the relationship between go and eo for an electrochemical reaction to derive the relationship between the standardstate cell potential and the equilibrium constant for the reaction click here to check your answer to practice problem

rug that’s too small—if you’re unsure or between sizes err on the larger side for a final look that feels thoughtful instead of haphazard living area there are three common furniture arrangements that
