all purchases until october   the sections under the subheading entitled policies about transactions  market timing policies and procedures are replaced in their entirety by the following market timing policies and procedures shortterm and excessive trading of fund shares may present risks to the funds longterm shareholders including potential dilution in the value of fund shares interference with the efficient management of the funds portfolio including losses on the sale of investments taxable gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage and administrative costs these risks may be more pronounced if the fund invests in certain securities such as those that trade in foreign markets are illiquid or do not otherwise have readily available market quotations certain investors may seek to employ shortterm trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund eg time zone arbitrage the fund discourages shortterm and excessive trading the fund will take steps to detect and deter shortterm and excessive trading pursuant to the funds policies as described in this prospectus and approved by the funds board the fund generally defines shortterm trading as purchase and redemption activity including exchanges that occurs within the time period for imposition of redemption fees the fund may also take trading activity that occurs over longer periods into account if the fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or disruptive to portfolio management the funds policies include o a  redemption fee on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period subject to certain exceptions discussed below under redemption fees o the fund reserves the right to reject or cancel a purchase or exchange order for any reason when in the opinion of the advisor there appears to be a pattern of shortterm or excessive trading activity by a shareholder or any other trading activity deemed harmful or disruptive to the fund and o the fund has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by the fund see how the fund calculates share price when a pattern of shortterm or excessive trading activity or other trading activity deemed harmful or disruptive to the fund by an investor is detected the advisor may determine to prohibit that investor from future purchases in the fund or to limit or terminate the investors exchange privilege the detection of these patterns and the banning of further trading are inherently subjective and therefore involve some selectivity in their application the advisor seeks to make such determinations in a manner consistent with the interests of the funds longterm shareholders there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of the funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in the fund it is important to note that shareholders that invest through omnibus accounts also may be subject to the policies and procedures of their financial intermediaries with respect to shortterm and excessive trading in the fund the funds market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated at any time dws scudder logo deutsche bank group october   dmf pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd effective for all purchases until october   the sections under the subheading entitled policies about transactions  redemption fees are replaced in their entirety by the following redemption fees the fund imposes a redemption fee of  of the total redemption amount calculated at net asset value without regard to the effect of any contingent deferred sales charge any contingent deferred sales charge is also assessed on the total redemption amount without regard to the assessment of the  redemption fee on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to the fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to the fund for this reason the fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to the fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from the funds subject to approval by the advisor or the funds board intermediaries who transact business on an omnibus basis may implement the redemption fees according to their own operational guidelines which may be different than the funds policies and remit the fees to the fund in addition certain intermediaries that do not currently have the capacity to collect redemption fees at an account level may be granted a temporary waiver from the funds policies until such time as they can develop and implement a system to collect the redemption fees the redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange or redemption transactions i transactions on behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs ii transactions on behalf of participants in certain group retirement plans and financial intermediaries whose processing systems are incapable of properly applying the redemption fee to underlying shareholders iii transactions on behalf of a shareholder to return any excess ira contributions to the shareholder iv transactions on behalf of a shareholder to effect a required minimum distribution on an ira v transactions on behalf of any mutual fund advised by the advisor and its affiliates eg funds of funds or in the case of a masterfeeder relationship redemptions by the feeder fund from the master portfolio vi transactions on behalf of certain unaffiliated mutual funds operating as funds of funds vii transactions following death or disability of any registered shareholder beneficial owner or grantor of a living trust with respect to shares purchased before death or disability viii transactions involving hardship of any registered shareholder ix systematic transactions with predefined trade dates for purchases exchanges or redemptions such as automatic account rebalancing or loan origination and repayments x transactions involving shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions xi transactions involving shares transferred from another account in the same fund or converted from another class of the same fund eg shares converting from class b to class a the redemption fee period will carry over to the acquired shares xii transactions initiated by the fund or administrator eg redemptions for not meeting account minimums to pay account fees funded by share redemptions or in the event of the liquidation or merger of the fund xiii transactions in cases when there are legal or contractual limitations or restrictions on the imposition of the redemption fee as determined by the fund or its agents in their sole discretion or xiv for dws massachusetts taxfree fund and dws intermediate taxamt free fund only checkwriting transactions in these funds the policy of the dws funds is to permit transactions on behalf of fund platform providers without the imposition of a redemption fee if such fund platform providers are able to implement trade block policies in which the period of time covered by the trade block is equal to or greater than the relevant redemption fee holding period for the dws fund the fund expects that the waiver for certain group retirement plans and financial intermediaries will be eliminated over time as their respective operating systems are improved until such time that these operating systems are improved the advisor will attempt to monitor the trading activity in these accounts and will take appropriate corrective action if it appears that a pattern of shortterm or excessive trading or other harmful or disruptive trading by underlying shareholders exists the fund reserves the right

paying current interest or in securities already in default these risks may be more pronounced focused investing risk the fact that the fund may focus on investments from a single state or sector of the municipal securities market increases risk because factors affecting the state or region such as economic or fiscal problems could affect a large portion of the funds securities in a similar manner for example a states technology or biotech industries could experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected hurting the local economy states that face severe fiscal difficulties due to an

developments in a particular class of bonds or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment also to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given industry it could be hurt if that industry does not do well derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the

circumstances the fund invests at least  of net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in securities issued by municipalities across the united states and in other securities whose income is free from regular federal income tax and alternative minimum tax amt the fund does not intend to invest in securities whose income is subject to amt the fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all maturities these may include revenue bonds which are backed by revenues from a particular source and general obligation bonds which are typically backed by the issuers ability to levy taxes they may also include municipal lease obligations and investments representing an interest therein credit quality policies this fund normally invests at least  of total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of credit quality the fund could put up to  of net assets in bonds rated in the fourth credit grade which is still considered investmentgrade the portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the best total return potential in making their buy and sell decisions the managers typically weigh a number of factors against each other from economic outlooks and possible interest rate movements to characteristics of specific securities such as coupon maturity date and call date and changes in supply and demand within the municipal bond market although the managers may adjust the maturity of the funds portfolio between three and ten years they generally intend to keep it between five and ten years   dws intermediate taxamt free fund

hedging purposes or to enhance return such instruments may include inverse floaters futures contracts interest rate swaps and other overthecounter derivatives the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments interest rate risk generally fixed income securities will decrease in value when interest rates rise the longer the effective maturity of the funds securities the more sensitive it will be to interest rate changes as a general rule a  rise in interest rates means a  fall in value for every year of duration as interest rates decline the issuers of securities held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in loweryielding securities and may reduce the funds income as interest rates increase slower than expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed income securities this will have the effect of locking in a belowmarket interest rate increasing the funds duration and reducing the value of such a security credit risk a fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the creditworthiness of an issuer may decline causing the value of its bonds to decline in addition an issuer may not be able to make timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has issued because the issuers of highyield bonds or junk bonds rated below the fourth highest category may be in uncertain financial health the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad economic news or even the expectation of bad news than investmentgrade bonds in some cases bonds particularly highyield bonds may decline in credit quality or go into default because the fund may invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities already in default these risks may be more pronounced the following sidebar text appears next to the preceding paragraphs this fund is designed for investors who are looking for a taxadvantaged investment are interested in higher yield and can accept moderate risk to their principal dws intermediate taxamt free fund   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th focused investing risk the fact that the fund may focus on investments from a single state or sector of the municipal securities market increases risk because factors affecting the state or region such as economic or fiscal problems could affect a large portion of the funds securities in a similar manner for example a states technology or biotech industries could experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected hurting the local economy states that face severe fiscal difficulties due to an economic downturn could experience increased expenditures on domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal government over time these issues may have the ability to impair a states ability to repay its obligations market risk deteriorating market conditions might cause a general weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities prices in that market developments in a particular class of bonds or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment also to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given industry it could be hurt if that industry does not do well derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower

strategy the fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from regular federal income tax under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of net assets in securities issued by municipalities across the united states and in other securities whose income is free from regular federal income tax the fund may invest up to  of net assets in securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax amt the fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all maturities these may include revenue bonds which are backed by revenues from a particular source and general obligation bonds which are typically backed by the issuers ability to levy taxes they may also include municipal lease obligations and investments representing an interest therein credit quality policies this fund normally invests at least  of total assets in municipal securities of the top four grades of credit quality the fund could put up to  of total assets in high yield bonds commonly referred to as junk bonds of the fifth and sixth credit grades ie as low as grade b compared to investmentgrade bonds junk bonds generally pay higher yields have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of interest or principal the portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the best total return potential in making their buy and sell decisions the managers typically weigh a number of factors against each other from economic outlooks and possible interest rate movements to characteristics of specific securities such as coupon maturity date and call date and changes in supply and demand within the municipal bond market   dws high yield tax free fund prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd although the managers may adjust the funds duration a measure of sensitivity to interest rates over a wider range they generally intend to keep it similar to that of the lehman brothers municipal bond index generally between five and nine years in addition they may use various types of derivative instruments instruments whose value is based on for example indices commodities or securities for hedging purposes or to enhance return such instruments may include inverse floaters futures contracts interest rate swaps and other overthecounter derivatives the main risks of investing in the fund there are several risk factors that could hurt the funds performance cause you to lose money or cause the funds performance to trail that of other investments interest rate risk generally fixed income securities will decrease in value when interest rates rise the longer the effective maturity of the funds securities the more sensitive it will be to interest rate changes as a general rule a  rise in interest rates means a  fall in value for every year of duration as interest rates decline the issuers of securities held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in loweryielding securities and may reduce the funds income as interest rates increase slower than expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed income securities this will have the effect of locking in a belowmarket interest rate increasing the funds duration and reducing the value of such a security credit risk a fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the creditworthiness of an issuer may decline causing the value of its bonds to decline in addition an issuer may not be able to make timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has issued because the issuers of highyield bonds or junk bonds rated below the fourth highest category may be in uncertain financial health the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad economic news or even the expectation of bad news

risks may be more pronounced focused investing risk the fact that the fund may focus on investments from a single state or sector of the municipal securities market increases risk because factors affecting the state or region such as economic or fiscal problems could affect a large portion of the funds securities in a similar manner for example a states technology or biotech industries could experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected hurting the local economy states that face severe fiscal difficulties due to an economic downturn could experience increased expenditures on domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal government over time these issues may have the ability to impair a states ability to repay its obligations market risk deteriorating market conditions might cause a general weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities prices in that market developments in a particular class of bonds or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment also to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given industry it could be hurt if that industry does not do well derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the funds exposure to the market and magnify potential losses there is no guarantee that derivatives to the extent employed will have the intended effect and their use could cause lower returns or even losses to the fund the use of derivatives by the fund to hedge risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements   dws high yield tax free fund

is defined as any combination of purchase and redemption activity including exchanges of the same funds shares each fund may take other trading activity into account if a fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be harmful to longterm shareholders or disruptive to portfolio management shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same dws fund excluding

not limited to systematic transactions required minimum retirement distributions transactions initiated by a fund or administrator and transactions by certain qualified fundoffunds in certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of a fund through a financial intermediary the fund may rely upon the financial intermediarys policy to deter shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor believes that the financial intermediarys policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that are not in the best interest of a fund a financial intermediarys policy relating to shortterm or excessive trading may be more or less restrictive than the dws funds policy may permit certain transactions not permitted by the dws funds policies or prohibit transactions not subject to the dws funds policies policies you should know about   pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial intermediary to enforce shortterm or

contractual or legal restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if a fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign securities it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect the fund from time zone arbitrage with respect to its foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a fund see how each fund calculates share price there is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in limiting shortterm and excessive trading in all cases for example the advisor may not be able to effectively monitor detect or limit shortterm or excessive trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by brokerdealers or other financial intermediaries the advisor reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect shortterm or excessive trading if the advisor has reason to suspect that shortterm or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level the advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request underlying shareholder level activity depending on the amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts which may represent most of a funds shares shortterm andor excessive trading of fund shares could adversely affect longterm shareholders in a fund if shortterm or excessive trading is identified the advisor will take appropriate action each funds market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated at any time redemption fees each fund imposes a redemption fee of  of the total redemption amount calculated at net asset value on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to each fund and is

trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known to a fund for this reason each fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to each fund however due to operational requirements the intermediaries methods for tracking and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from each funds the redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange or redemption transactions i transactions on behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs ii transactions on behalf of participants in certain group

similar level of protection for each fund against such transactions for example certain financial intermediaries may have contractual or legal restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account in such instances the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques that the advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a block in addition if a fund invests some portion of its

amount calculated at net asset value on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within  days of buying them either by purchase or exchange the redemption fee is paid directly to each fund and is designed to encourage longterm investment and to offset transaction and other costs associated with shortterm or excessive trading for purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies shares held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last the redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or through a financial intermediary such as a brokerdealer transactions through financial intermediaries typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple investors these purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one another and placed on an aggregate basis consequently the identities of

objectives and policies descriptions in this statement of additional information of a particular investment practice or technique in which a fund may engage are meant to describe the spectrum of

instrument for one or more funds but not for all funds advised by it furthermore it is possible that certain types of financial instruments or investment techniques described herein may not be

investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor these securities usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk to principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the more their risks render them like equity securities securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest see ratings of investments for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics issuers of such high yield securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally is greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yield securities may experience financial stress during such periods such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific corporate developments or the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer prices and yields of high yield  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates a fund may have difficulty disposing of certain highyield securities because they may have a thin trading market because not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities a fund anticipates that such securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on the market price and a funds ability to dispose of particular issues and may also make it more difficult for a fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing a funds assets market quotations generally are available on many high yield issues only from a limited number of dealers and may not necessarily represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular highyield security for these reasons it is generally the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of a fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for highyield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments also congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type a portion of the highyield securities acquired by the funds may be purchased upon issuance which may involve special risks because the securities so acquired are new issues in such instances that fund may be a substantial purchaser of the issue and therefore have the opportunity to participate in structuring the terms of the offering although this may enable the fund to seek to protect itself against certain of such risks the considerations discussed herein would nevertheless remain applicable illiquid securities and restricted securities a fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid each funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the

underwriter for purposes of the securities act of  as amended when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event a fund  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading a fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them a fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between a funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which a fund is permitted or able to sell such security a fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of a fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in a fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause a fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on a funds performance to the extent that a fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact a funds expense ratio industrial development and pollution control bonds industrial development and pollution control bonds which are types of private activity bonds although nominally issued by municipal authorities are generally not secured by the taxing power of the municipality but are secured by the revenues of the authority derived from payments by the industrial user under federal tax legislation certain types of industrial development bonds and pollution control bonds may no longer be issued on a taxexempt basis although previously issued bonds of these types and certain refundings of such bonds are not affected for the purposes of the funds investment limitation regarding concentration of investments in any one industry industrial development or other private activity bonds ultimately payable by companies within the same industry will be considered as if they were issued by issuers in the same industry interfund borrowing and lending program the funds have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission sec which permits the funds to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash swap arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with a funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the funds are actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the funds as a matter of nonfundamental policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investmentgrade bonds a fund may purchase investmentgrade bonds which are those rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys or aaa aa a or bbb by sp or if unrated judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor moodys considers bonds it rates baa to have speculative elements as well as investmentgrade

inverse relationship to changes in shortterm market interest rates investments in this type of instrument involve special risks as compared to investments in for example a fixed rate municipal security the debt instrument in which a fund invests may be a tender option bond trust the trust which can be established by a fund a financial institution or a broker consisting of underlying municipal obligations other investors in the trust usually consist of money market fund investors normally receiving weekly floating interest rate payments who have put options with the financial institutions a fund may enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements by which a fund agrees to reimburse the trust in certain circumstances for the difference between the liquidation value of the fixed rate municipal security held by the trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate notes a fund could lose money and its nav could decline as a result of investments in inverse floaters if movements in interest rates are incorrectly anticipated moreover the markets for inverse floaters may be less developed and may have less liquidity than the markets for more traditional municipal securities a funds investments in inverse floaters will not be considered borrowing within the meaning of the  act or for purposes of a funds investment restrictions on borrowing investment of

including certificates of participation commercial paper and other shortterm obligations may be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit of a bank which assumes the obligation for payment of principal and interest in the event of default by the issuer only banks which in the opinion of the advisor are of investment quality comparable to other permitted investments of a fund may be used for letter of creditbacked investments municipal securities municipal obligations are issued by or on behalf of states territories and possessions of the united states and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities and the district of columbia to obtain funds for various public purposes the interest on these obligations is generally exempt from regular federal income tax in the hands of most investors the two principal classifications of municipal obligations are notes and bonds municipal notes are generally used to provide for shortterm capital needs and generally have maturities of one year or less municipal notes include tax anticipation notes revenue anticipation notes bond anticipation notes and construction loan notes tax anticipation notes are sold to finance working capital needs of municipalities they are generally payable from specific tax revenues expected to be received at a future date revenue anticipation notes are issued in expectation of receipt

of longterm financing in the market in most cases these monies provide for the repayment of the notes after the projects are successfully completed and accepted many projects receive permanent financing through the federal housing administration under fannie mae the federal national mortgage association or ginnie mae the government national mortgage association there are of course a number of other types of notes issued for different purposes and secured differently than those described above municipal bonds which meet longerterm capital needs and generally have maturities of more than one year when issued have two principal classifications general obligation bonds and revenue bonds issuers of general obligation bonds include states counties cities towns and regional districts the proceeds of these obligations are used to fund a wide range of public projects including the construction or improvement of schools highways and roads water and sewer systems and a variety of other public purposes the basic security behind general obligation bonds is the issuers pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest the taxes that can be levied for the payment of debt service may be limited or unlimited as to rate amount or special assessments the principal security for a revenue bond is generally the net revenues derived from a particular facility or group of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source revenue bonds have been issued to fund a wide variety of capital projects including electric gas water and sewer systems highways bridges and tunnels port and airport facilities colleges and universities and hospitals although the principal security behind these bonds varies widely many provide additional security in the form of a debt service reserve fund whose monies may also be used to make principal and interest payments on the issuers obligations housing finance authorities have a wide range of security including partially or fullyinsured rentsubsidized andor collateralized mortgages andor the net revenues from housing or other public projects in addition to a debt service reserve fund some authorities provide further security in the form of a states ability without obligation to make up deficiencies in the debt reserve fund lease rental bonds issued by a state or local authority for capital projects are secured by annual lease rental payments from the state or locality to the authority sufficient to cover debt service on the authoritys obligations some issues of municipal bonds are payable from united states treasury bonds and notes or agency obligations held in escrow by a trustee frequently a commercial bank the interest and principal on these us government securities are sufficient to pay all interest and principal requirements of the municipal securities when due some escrowed treasury securities are used to retire municipal bonds at their earliest call date while others are used to retire municipal bonds at their maturity securities purchased for a fund may include variablefloating rate instruments variable mode instruments put bonds and other obligations which have a specified maturity date but also are payable before maturity after notice by the holder demand obligations demand obligations are considered for a funds purposes to mature at the demand date there are in addition a variety of hybrid and special types of municipal obligations as well as numerous differences in the security of municipal obligations both within and between the two principal classifications ie notes and bonds discussed above an entire issue of municipal securities may be purchased by one or a small number of institutional investors such as a fund thus such an issue may not be said to be publicly offered unlike the equity securities of operating companies or mutual funds which must be registered under the  act prior to offer and sale unless an exemption from such registration is available municipal securities whether publicly or privately offered may nevertheless be readily marketable a secondary market exists for municipal securities which have been publicly offered as well as securities which have not been publicly offered initially but which may nevertheless be readily marketable municipal securities purchased for a fund are subject to the limitations on holdings of securities which are not readily marketable based on whether it may be sold in a reasonable time consistent with the customs of the municipal markets usually seven days at a price or interest rate which accurately reflects its recorded value a fund believes that the quality standards applicable to their investments enhance marketability in addition standby commitments participation interests and demand obligations also enhance marketability  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th provisions of the federal bankruptcy statutes relating to the adjustment of debts of political subdivisions and authorities of states of the united states provide that in certain circumstances such subdivisions or authorities may be authorized to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without prior notice to or consent of creditors which proceedings could result in material and adverse modification or alteration of the rights of holders of obligations issued by such subdivisions or authorities litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of present systems of financing public education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of states and legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school finances in some states in other instances there has been litigation challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds or the validity of their issuance under state or federal law which litigation could ultimately affect the validity of those municipal securities or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon in some cases municipalities may issue bonds relying on proceeds from litigation settlements these bonds may be further secured by debt service reserve funds established at the time the bonds were issued bonds that are supported in whole or in part by expected litigation proceeds are subject to the risk that part or all of the expected proceeds may not be received for example a damage award could be overturned or reduced by a court or the terms of a settlement or damages award may allow for reduced or discontinued payments if certain conditions are met as a result bonds that rely on proceeds from litigation proceeds are subject to an increased risk of nonpayment or default for the purpose of the funds investment restrictions the identification of the issuer of municipal obligations which are not general obligation bonds is made by the advisor on the basis of the characteristics of the obligation as described above the most significant of which is the source of funds for the payment of principal and interest on such obligations municipal lease obligations and participation interests participation interests represent undivided interests in municipal leases installment purchase contracts conditional sales contracts or other instruments these are typically issued by a trust or other entity which has received an assignment of the payments to be made by the state or political subdivision under such leases or contracts they may be variable rate or fixed rate each fund may purchase from banks participation interests in all or part of specific holdings of municipal obligations provided the participation interest is fully insured each participation is backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of the selling bank that the advisor has determined meets the prescribed quality standards of a fund therefore either the credit of the issuer of the municipal obligation or the selling bank or both will meet the quality standards of the particular fund a fund has the right to sell the participation back to the bank after seven days notice for the full principal amount of a funds interest in the municipal obligation plus accrued interest but only i as required to provide liquidity to a fund ii to maintain a high quality investment portfolio or iii upon a default under the terms of the municipal obligation the selling bank will receive a fee from a fund in connection with the arrangement a fund will not purchase participation interests unless in the opinion of bond counsel counsel for the issuers of such participations or counsel selected by the advisor the interest from such participations is exempt from regular federal income tax and state income tax for a fund a municipal lease obligation may take the form of a lease installment purchase contract or conditional sales contract which is issued by a state or local government and authorities to acquire land equipment and facilities income from such obligations is generally exempt from state and local taxes in the state of issuance municipal lease obligations frequently involve special risks not normally associated with general obligations or revenue bonds leases and installment purchase or conditional sale contracts which normally provide for title in the leased asset to pass eventually to the governmental issuer have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt the debt issuance limitations are deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases or contracts of nonappropriation clauses that relieve the governmental issuer of any obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis in addition such leases or contracts may be subject to the temporary abatement of payments in the event the issuer is prevented from maintaining occupancy of the leased premises or utilizing the leased equipment although the obligations may be secured by the leased equipment or facilities the disposition of the property in the event of nonappropriation or foreclosure might prove difficult time consuming and costly and result in a delay in recovery or the failure to fully recover a funds original investment  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th certain municipal lease obligations and participation interests may be deemed illiquid for the purpose of a funds limitation on investments in illiquid securities other municipal lease obligations and participation interests acquired by a fund may be determined by the advisor to be liquid securities for the purpose of such limitation in determining the liquidity of municipal lease obligations and participation interests the advisor will consider a variety of factors including  the willingness of dealers to bid for the security  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the obligation and the number of other potential buyers  the frequency of trades or quotes for the obligation and  the nature of the marketplace trades in addition the advisor will consider factors unique to particular lease obligations and participation interests affecting the marketability thereof these include the general creditworthiness of the issuer the importance to the issuer of the property covered by the lease and the likelihood that the marketability of the obligation will be maintained throughout the time the obligation is held by a fund a fund may purchase participation interests in municipal lease obligations held by a commercial bank or other financial institution such participations provide a fund with the right to a pro rata undivided interest in the underlying municipal lease obligations in addition such participations generally provide a fund with the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice of all or any part of such funds participation interest in the underlying municipal lease obligation plus accrued interest participation interests a fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which a fund may invest a participation interest gives a fund an undivided interest in the security in the proportion that the funds participation interest bears to the principal amount of the security these instruments may have fixed floating or variable interest rates if the participation interest is unrated or has been given a rating below that which is permissible for purchase by a fund the participation interest will be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of a bank or the payment obligation will be collateralized by us government securities or in the case of unrated participation interest determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality to those instruments in which a fund may invest for certain participation interests a fund will have the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice for all or any part of a funds participation interests in the security plus accrued interest as to these instruments a fund generally intends to exercise its right to demand payment only upon a default under the terms of the security repurchase agreements a fund may invest in repurchase agreements subject to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement a fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and as described in more detail below the value of the account is kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to a fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case income to a fund is unrelated to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement a fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt obligation purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to reduce the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case the fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to a fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interest of the obligation subject  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value including interest of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price reverse repurchase agreements a fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which the fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase such securities at an agreed time and price the fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and its yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage securities backed by guarantees the fund may invest in securities backed by guarantees from banks insurance companies and other financial institutions a money market funds ability to maintain a stable share price may depend upon such guarantees which are not supported by federal deposit insurance consequently changes in the credit quality of these institutions could have an adverse impact on securities they have guaranteed or backed which could cause losses to a fund and affect its share price standby commitments a standby commitment is a right acquired by a fund when it purchases a municipal obligation from a broker dealer or other financial institution seller to sell up to the same principal amount of such securities back to the seller at a funds option at a specified price standby commitments are also known as puts the investment policies of dws high yield tax free fund and dws managed municipal bond fund permit the acquisition of standby commitments solely to facilitate portfolio liquidity the exercise by a fund of a standby commitment is subject to the ability and willingness of the other party to fulfill its contractual commitment standby commitments acquired by a fund will have the following features  they will be in writing and will be physically held by the funds custodian  the funds right to exercise them will be unconditional and unqualified  they will be entered into only with sellers which in the advisors opinion present a minimal risk of default  although standby commitments will not be transferable municipal obligations purchased subject to such commitments may be sold to a third party at any time even though the commitment is outstanding and  their exercise price will be i a funds acquisition cost excluding any accrued interest which a fund paid on their acquisition less any amortized market premium or plus any amortized original issue discount during the period a fund owned the securities plus ii all interest accrued on the securities since the last interest payment date a fund expects that standby commitments generally will be available without the payment of any direct or indirect consideration however if necessary or advisable a fund will pay for standby commitments either separately in cash or by paying a higher price for portfolio securities which are acquired subject to the commitments it is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential benefit of a standby commitment therefore it is expected that the advisor will determine that standby commitments ordinarily have a fair value of zero regardless of whether any direct or indirect consideration was paid however if the market price of the security subject to the standby commitment is less than the exercise price of the standby commitment such security will ordinarily be valued at such exercise price where each fund has paid for a standby commitment its cost will be reflected as unrealized depreciation for the period during which the commitment is held the advisor understands that the internal revenue service the service has issued a favorable revenue ruling to the effect that under specified circumstances a registered investment company will be the owner of taxexempt municipal obligations acquired subject to a put option the service has also issued private letter rulings to certain taxpayers which do not serve as precedent for other taxpayers to the effect that taxexempt interest received by a regulated investment company with respect to such obligations will be taxexempt in the hands of the company and may be distributed to its shareholders as exemptinterest dividends the service has subsequently announced that it will not ordinarily issue advance ruling letters as to the identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities or participation interests therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the security or the participation interest therein to be purchased by either the seller or a third party a fund intends to take the position that it owns any municipal obligations acquired subject to a standby commitment and that taxexempt interest  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th earned with respect to such municipal obligations will be taxexempt in its hands there is no assurance that the service will agree with such position in any particular case strategic transactions and derivatives a fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the funds may purchase and sell exchangelisted and over the counter put and call options on securities fixedincome indices and other financial instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon and enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors or collars collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include new techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit except to the extent that  of the funds net assets are required to be invested in taxexempt municipal securities and as limited by the funds other investment restrictions and subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets fluctuations to protect the funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of a funds portfolio or to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a temporary substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of each funds assets will be committed to strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the funds to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the funds will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of the funds and a fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of a fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause a fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of that funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchase of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance a funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving a fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto a fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting a fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to a fund at a formula price within seven days a fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied a fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by

purchased by the fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if a fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase a funds income the sale of put options can also provide income a fund may purchase and sell call options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities municipal obligations mortgagebacked securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices and futures contracts all calls sold by a fund must be covered ie a fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes a fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold a fund may purchase and sell put options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities municipal obligations and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities a fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of such funds assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures a fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or fixedincome market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position each fund has claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the funds are not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the marktomarket value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of options on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of a fund if a fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur a fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of a funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation the segregation requirements with respect to futures contracts and options thereon are described below swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which a fund may enter are interest rate index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars a fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio as a duration management technique to protect against any increase in the price of securities a fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns a fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream a fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values a fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with a fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments a fund will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the counterparty combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from an nrsro or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor if there is a default by the counterparty a fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that a fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by a fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by a fund will require a fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by a fund on an index will require a fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by a fund requires that fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when a fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates a fund to buy or sell currency will  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th generally require that fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to a funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of a funds obligation otc options entered into by a fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when a fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by a fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when a fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price a fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by a fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and that fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon a fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps a fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to a funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies a fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example a fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by a fund moreover instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if a fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated taxexempt custodial receipts dws managed municipal bond fund may purchase taxexempt custodial receipts the receipts which evidence ownership in an underlying bond that is deposited with a custodian for safekeeping holders of the receipts receive all payments of principal and interest when paid on the bonds receipts can be purchased in an offering or from a counterparty typically an investment bank to the extent that any receipt is illiquid it is subject to the funds limit on illiquid securities tax exempt passthrough securities the dws high yield tax free fund may purchase tax exempt passthrough certificates these represent an interest in a pool or group of fixedrate longterm debt obligations issued by or on behalf of primarily notforprofit institutions the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation including alternative minimum taxation such fixedrate longterm debt obligations may be private activity bonds issued by states municipalities or public authorities to provide funds usually through a loan or lease arrangement to a nonprofit corporation for the purpose of financing or refinancing the construction or improvement of a facility to be used by the nonprofit corporation distributions on tax exempt passthrough certificates may be adversely affected by defaults in or prepayment of the underlying debt obligations certain tax exempt passthrough certificates are issued in several classes with different levels of yields and credit protection the fund may invest in lower classes of tax exempt passthrough certificates that have less credit protection tax exempt passthrough certificates have limited liquidity and certain transfer restrictions may apply there currently is no trading market for tax exempt passthrough certificates and there can be no assurance that such a market will develop  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th third party puts a fund may purchase longterm fixed rate bonds that have been coupled with an option granted by a third party financial institution allowing a fund at specified intervals to tender or put the bonds to the institution and receive the face value thereof plus accrued interest these third party puts are available in several different forms may be represented by custodial receipts or trust certificates and may be combined with other features such as interest rate swaps a fund receives a shortterm rate of interest which is periodically reset and the interest rate differential between that rate and the fixed rate on the bond is retained by the financial institution the financial institution granting the option does not provide credit enhancement and in the event that there is a default in the payment of principal or interest or downgrading of a bond to below investment grade or a loss of the bonds taxexempt status the put option will terminate automatically the risk to a fund will be that of holding such a longterm bond and the weighted average maturity of that funds portfolio would be adversely affected these bonds coupled with puts may present the same tax issues as are associated with standby commitments as with any standby commitments acquired by a fund the fund intends to take the position that it is the owner of any municipal obligation acquired subject to a thirdparty put and that taxexempt interest earned with respect to such municipal obligations will be taxexempt in its hands there is no assurance that the service will agree with such position in any particular case additionally the federal income tax treatment of certain other aspects of these investments including the treatment of tender fees and swap payments in relation to various regulated investment company tax provisions is unclear however the advisor seeks to manage a funds portfolio in a manner designed to minimize any adverse impact from these investments us government securities there are two broad categories of us governmentrelated debt instruments a direct obligations of the us treasury and b securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies examples of direct obligations of the us treasury are treasury bills notes bonds and other debt securities issued by the us treasury these instruments are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states they differ primarily in interest rates the length of maturities and the dates of issuance treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less treasury notes have original maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have original maturities of greater than ten years some agency securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states such as maritime administration title xi ship financing bonds and agency for international development housing guarantee program bonds and others are backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury such as federal home loan bank bonds and federal national mortgage association bonds while still others such as the securities of the federal farm credit bank are supported only by the credit of the issuer with respect to securities supported only by the credit of the issuing agency or by an additional line of credit with the us treasury there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest us government securities may include zero coupon securities that have been stripped by the us government of their unmatured interest coupons and collateralized obligations issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or instrumentality interest rates on us government obligations may be fixed or variable interest rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular intervals at least annually according to a formula reflecting thencurrent specified standard rates such as day us treasury bill rates these adjustments generally tend to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities the government guarantee of the us government securities in a funds portfolio does not guarantee the net asset value of the shares of that fund there are market risks inherent in all investments in securities and the value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate over time normally the value of investments in us government securities varies inversely with changes in interest rates for example as interest rates rise the value of investments in us government securities will tend to decline and as interest rates fall the value of a funds investments will tend to increase in addition the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased principal prepayments with respect to certain mortgagebacked securities such as gnma certificates prepayments of high interest rate mortgagebacked securities during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the return of a fund and may even result in losses to the fund if some securities were acquired at  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th a premium moreover during periods of rising interest rates prepayments of mortgagebacked securities may decline resulting in the extension of a funds average portfolio maturity as a result a funds portfolio may experience greater volatility during periods of rising interest rates than under normal market conditions whenissued securities a fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by a fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to a fund when a fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of a fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities a fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the funds intend to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price masterfeeder fund structure the board of trustees has the discretion to retain the current distribution arrangement for a fund while investing in a master fund in a masterfeeder fund structure as described below a masterfeeder fund structure is one in which a fund a feeder fund instead of investing directly in a portfolio of securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is able to convert to a feeder fund by selling all of its investments which involves

accounts managed by each funds portfolio management team investment decisions for the fund and other clients are made with a view to achieving their respective investment objectives and after consideration of such factors as their current holdings availability of cash for investment and the size of their investments generally a particular security may be bought or sold for only one client or in different amounts and at different times for more than one but less than all clients likewise because clients of the advisor may have differing investment strategies a particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling the security the investment results achieved for each fund may differ from the results achieved for other clients of the advisor in addition purchases or sales of the same security may be made for two or more clients on the same day in such event such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a manner believed by the advisor to be most equitable to each client generally utilizing a pro rata allocation methodology in some cases the allocation procedure could potentially have an adverse effect or positive effect on the price or amount of the securities purchased or sold by each fund purchase and sale orders for each fund may be combined with those of other clients of the advisor in the interest of achieving the most favorable net results to each fund and the other clients o to the extent that a portfolio manager has responsibilities for managing multiple client accounts a portfolio manager will need to divide time and attention among relevant accounts the advisor attempts to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio management teams by investment strategy and by employing similar investment models across multiple client accounts o in some cases an apparent conflict may arise where the advisor has an incentive such as a performancebased fee in managing one account and not with respect to other accounts it manages the advisor will not determine allocations based on whether it receives a performancebased fee from the client additionally the advisor has in place supervisory oversight processes to periodically monitor performance deviations for accounts with like strategies o the advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of the funds may manage other mutual funds

expended over that same period in providing distribution services for a fund in connection with class b shares for example if shares of a fund were to appreciate resulting in greater asset base against which rule b fees are charged and sales of the funds shares were to decline resulting in lower expenditures by dwssdi under the rule b plan fees payable could exceed expenditures this may also happen over certain periods shorter than the life of the rule b plan simply due to the timing of expenses incurred by dwssdi that is not matched to the timing of revenues received eg a sales

however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented

of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services to the advisor consistent with the advisors policy regarding best execution where more than one broker is believed to be capable of providing best execution for a particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor in providing services to clients other than the fund making the trade and not all such information is used by the advisor in connection with such fund conversely such information provided to the advisor by brokerdealers through which other clients of the advisor effect securities transactions may be useful to the advisor in providing services to a fund research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers may include but are not limited to information on the economy industries groups of securities individual companies statistical information accounting and tax law interpretations political developments legal developments affecting portfolio securities technical market action pricing and appraisal services credit analysis risk measurement analysis performance analysis and measurement and analysis of corporate responsibility issues research and brokerage services are typically received in the form of written reports access to specialized financial publications and personal meetings with security analysts but may also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings arranged with corporate and industry representatives the advisor may also select brokerdealers and obtain from them research and brokerage services that are used in connection with executing trades provided that such services are consistent with interpretations under section e of the  act typically these services take the form of computer software andor electronic communication services used by the advisor to facilitate trading activity with those brokerdealers research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties if the advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and research as defined in section e and interpretations thereunder currently it is the advisors policy that subadvisors may not execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds to obtain third party research and brokerage services the advisor may in the future change this policy regardless certain subadvisors may as matter of internal policy limit or preclude third party research and brokerage services dima will monitor regulatory developments and market practice in the use of client commissions to obtain

investment accounts managed by the advisor are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions however the same investment decision may be made for two or more of such accounts in such cases simultaneous transactions are inevitable to the extent permitted by law the advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in executing transactions purchases or sales are then averaged as to price and commission and allocated as to amount in a manner deemed equitable to each account while in some cases this practice could have a detrimental effect on the price paid or received by or on the size of the position obtained or disposed of for the fund in other cases it is believed that the ability to engage in volume transactions will be beneficial to the fund dima and its affiliates and the funds management team manage other mutual funds and separate accounts some of which use short sales of securities as a part of its investment strategy the simultaneous management of long and short portfolios creates potential conflicts of interest including the risk that short sale activity could adversely affect the market value of the long positions and vice versa the risk arising from sequential orders in long and short positions and the risks associated with receiving opposing orders at the same time dima has adopted procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to mitigate these potential conflicts of interest incorporated in the procedures are specific guidelines developed to

of a portfolio companys management in deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the guidelines but managements views are not determinative as mentioned above the policies describe the way in which the advisor resolves conflicts of interest to resolve conflicts the advisor under normal circumstances votes proxies in accordance with its guidelines if the advisor departs from the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy or if the guidelines do not specifically address a certain proxy proposal a proxy voting committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy before voting any such proxy however the advisors conflicts review committee will conduct an investigation to determine whether any potential conflicts of interest exist in connection with the particular proxy proposal if the conflicts review committee determines that the advisor has a material conflict of interest or certain individuals on the proxy voting committee should be recused from participating in a particular proxy vote it will inform the proxy voting committee if notified that the advisor has a material conflict or fewer than three voting members are eligible to

exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities a bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ba bonds which are rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class b bonds which are rated b are considered speculative and generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time

assets  of assets in the case of dws managed municipal bond fund and dws intermediate taxamt free fund may be held in cash or invested in shortterm taxable investments including us government obligations and money market instruments although there is no current intention to do so each fund may invest more than  of its total assets in industrial development or other private activity bonds subject to a funds fundamental investment policies because these bonds are frequently subject to regular federal income tax and amt investment in these types of bonds is also subject to a funds limitation on investing in municipal securities whose investment income is subject to these taxes investment policies and techniques general investment objectives and policies descriptions in this statement of additional information of a particular investment practice or technique in which a fund may engage are meant to describe the spectrum of investments that the advisor in its discretion might but is not required to use in managing each funds portfolio assets the advisor may in its discretion at any time employ such practice technique or instrument for one or more funds but not for all funds advised by it furthermore it is possible that certain types of financial instruments or investment techniques described herein may not be available permissible economically feasible or effective for their intended purposes in all markets certain practices techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of the funds but to the extent employed could from time to time have a material impact on a funds performance it is possible that certain investment practices and techniques described below may not be permissible for a fund based on its investment restrictions as described herein and in the funds applicable prospectus advance refunded bonds each fund may purchase municipal securities that are subsequently refunded by the issuance and delivery of a new issue of bonds prior to the date on which the outstanding issue of bonds can be redeemed or paid the proceeds from the new issue of bonds are typically placed in an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations that are used to pay the interest principal and call premium on the issue being refunded each fund may also purchase municipal securities that have been refunded prior to purchase by a fund high yieldhigh risk bonds the dws high yield tax free fund and the dws managed municipal bond fund may also purchase debt securities which are rated below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds that is rated below baa by moodys or below bbb by sp and unrated securities judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor these securities usually entail greater risk including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of such securities generally involve greater volatility of price and risk to principal and income and may be less liquid than securities in the higher rating categories the lower the ratings of such debt securities the more their risks render them like equity securities securities rated d may be in default with respect to payment of principal or interest see ratings of investments for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations and their respective characteristics issuers of such high yield securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers generally is greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yield securities may experience financial stress during such periods such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific corporate developments or the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer prices and yields of high yield securities will fluctuate over time and during periods of economic uncertainty volatility of high yield securities may adversely affect a funds net asset value in addition investments in high yield zero coupon or payinkind bonds rather than incomebearing high yield securities may be more speculative and may be subject to greater fluctuations in value due to changes in interest rates a fund may have difficulty disposing of certain highyield securities because they may have a thin trading market because not all dealers maintain markets in all high yield securities a fund anticipates that such securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors the lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on the market price and a funds ability to dispose of particular issues and may also make it more difficult for a fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing a funds assets market quotations generally are available on many high yield issues only from a limited number of dealers and may not necessarily represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales adverse publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high yield securities these securities may also involve special registration responsibilities liabilities and costs and liquidity and valuation difficulties credit quality in the highyield securities market can change suddenly and unexpectedly and even recentlyissued credit ratings may not fully reflect the actual risks posed by a particular high yield security for these reasons it is generally the policy of the advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by established credit rating agencies but to supplement such ratings with its own independent and ongoing review of credit quality the achievement of a funds investment objective by investment in such securities may be more dependent on the advisors credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds should the rating of a portfolio security be downgraded the advisor will determine whether it is in the best interests of a fund to retain or dispose of such security prices for highyield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments also congress has from time to time considered legislation which would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in these securities and regulate corporate restructurings such legislation may significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type a portion of the highyield securities acquired by a fund may be purchased upon issuance which may involve special risks because the securities so acquired are new issues in such instances a fund may be a substantial purchaser of the issue and therefore have the opportunity to participate in structuring the terms of the offering although this may enable a fund to seek to protect itself against certain of such risks the considerations discussed herein would nevertheless remain applicable illiquid securities and restricted securities a fund may purchase securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale restricted securities generally speaking restricted securities may be sold i to qualified institutional buyers ii in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers iii in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration or iv in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  as amended the  act issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded restricted securities are often illiquid but they may also be liquid for example restricted securities that are eligible for resale under rule a are often deemed to be liquid each funds board has approved guidelines for use by the advisor in determining whether a security is liquid or illiquid among the factors the advisor may consider in reaching liquidity decisions relating to rule a securities are  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security ie the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer issuers of restricted securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that would be applicable if their securities were publicly traded where a registration statement is required for the resale of restricted securities a fund may be required to bear all or part of the registration expenses a fund may be deemed to be an underwriter for purposes of the securities act of  as amended when selling restricted securities to the public and in such event a fund may be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading a fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale but that are deemed illiquid such securities may be illiquid for example because there is a limited trading market for them a fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security in addition it may be more difficult to determine a market value for restricted or illiquid securities moreover if adverse market conditions were to develop during the period between a funds decision to sell a restricted or illiquid security and the point at which a fund is permitted or able to sell such security a fund might obtain a price less favorable than the price that prevailed when it decided to sell impact of large redemptions and purchases of fund shares from time to time shareholders of a fund which may include affiliated andor nonaffiliated registered investment companies that invest in a fund may make relatively large redemptions or purchases of fund shares these transactions may cause a fund to have to sell securities or invest additional cash as the case may be while it is impossible to predict the overall impact of these transactions over time there could be adverse effects on a funds performance to the extent that a fund may be required to sell securities or invest cash at times when it would not otherwise do so these transactions could also accelerate the realization of taxable income if sales of securities resulted in gains and could also increase transaction costs which may impact a funds expense ratio industrial development and pollution control bonds industrial development and pollution control bonds which are types of private activity bonds although nominally issued by municipal authorities are generally not secured by the taxing power of the municipality but are secured by the revenues of the authority derived from payments by the industrial user under federal tax legislation certain types of industrial development bonds and pollution control bonds may no longer be issued on a taxexempt basis although previouslyissued bonds of these types and certain refundings of such bonds are not affected for the purposes of the funds investment limitation regarding concentration of investments in any one industry industrial development or other private activity bonds ultimately payable by companies within the same industry will be considered as if they were issued by issuers in the same industry interfund borrowing and lending program the funds have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission sec which permits the funds to participate in an interfund lending program among certain investment companies advised by the advisor the interfund lending program allows the participating funds to borrow money from and loan money to each other for temporary or emergency purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating funds including the following  no fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating funds under a loan agreement and  no fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash swap arrangements in addition a fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with a funds investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders and tax exempt funds only as borrowers interfund loans and borrowings may extend overnight but could have a maximum duration of seven days loans may be called on one days notice a fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the boards of the participating funds to the extent the funds are actually engaged in borrowing through the interfund lending program the funds as a matter of nonfundamental  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd policy may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency purposes and not for leveraging except that the funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose investmentgrade bonds a fund may purchase investmentgrade bonds which are those rated aaa aa a or baa by moodys or aaa aa a or bbb by sp or if unrated judged to be of equivalent quality as determined by the advisor moodys considers bonds it rates baa to have speculative elements as well as investmentgrade characteristics to the extent that a fund invests in highergrade securities a fund will not be able to avail itself of opportunities for higher income which may be available at lower grades inverse floaters a fund may invest in inverse floaters inverse floaters are debt instruments typically with a weekly floating rate of interest that bears an inverse relationship to changes in shortterm market interest rates investments in this type of instrument involve special risks as compared to investments in for example a fixed rate municipal security the debt instrument in which a fund invests may be a tender option bond trust the trust which can be established by a fund a financial institution or a broker consisting of underlying municipal obligations other investors in the trust usually consist of money market fund investors normally receiving weekly floating interest rate payments who have put options with the financial institutions a fund may enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements by which a fund agrees to reimburse the trust in certain circumstances for the difference between the liquidation value of the fixed rate municipal security held by the trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate notes a fund could lose money and its nav could decline as a result of investments in inverse floaters if movements in interest rates are incorrectly anticipated moreover the markets for inverse floaters may be less developed and may have less liquidity than the markets for more traditional municipal securities a funds investments in inverse floaters will not be considered borrowing within the meaning of the  act or for purposes of a funds investment restrictions on borrowing investment of uninvested cash balances a fund may have cash balances that have not been invested in portfolio securities uninvested cash uninvested cash may result from a variety of sources including dividends or interest received from portfolio securities unsettled securities transactions reserves held for investment strategy purposes scheduled maturity of investments liquidation of investment securities to meet anticipated redemptions and dividend payments and new cash received from investors uninvested cash may be invested directly in money market instruments or other shortterm debt obligations pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the sec a fund may use uninvested cash to purchase shares of affiliated funds including money market funds shortterm bond funds and cash management qp trust or one or more future entities for which the advisor acts as trustee or investment advisor that operate as cash management investment vehicles and that are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to section c or c of the  act collectively the central funds in excess of the limitations of section d of the  act investment by the fund in shares of the central funds will be in accordance with a funds investment policies and restrictions as set forth in its registration statement certain of the central funds comply with rule a under the  act the other central funds are or will be shortterm bond funds that invest in fixedincome securities and maintain a dollar weighted average maturity of three years or less each of the central funds will be managed specifically to maintain a highly liquid portfolio and access to them will enhance the funds ability to manage uninvested cash a fund will invest uninvested cash in central funds only to the extent that a funds aggregate investment in the central funds does not exceed  of its total assets purchase and sales of shares of central funds are made at net asset value letters of credit municipal obligations including certificates of participation commercial paper and other shortterm obligations may be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit of a bank which assumes the obligation for payment of principal and interest in the event of default by the issuer only banks which in the opinion of the advisor are of investment quality comparable to other permitted investments of a fund may be used for letter of creditbacked investments municipal securities municipal obligations are issued by or on behalf of states territories and possessions of the united states and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities and the district of columbia to obtain funds for various public purposes the interest on these obligations is generally exempt from regular federal income  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd tax in the hands of most investors the two principal classifications of municipal obligations are notes and bonds municipal notes are generally used to provide for shortterm capital needs and generally have maturities of one year or less municipal notes include tax anticipation notes revenue anticipation notes bond anticipation notes and construction loan notes tax anticipation notes are sold to finance working capital needs of municipalities they are generally payable from specific tax revenues expected to be received at a future date revenue anticipation notes are issued in expectation of receipt of other types of revenue tax anticipation notes and revenue anticipation notes are issued in anticipation of various seasonal revenue such as income sales use and business taxes bond anticipation notes are sold to provide interim financing and construction loan notes are sold to provide construction financing these notes are issued in anticipation of longterm financing in the market in most cases these monies provide for the repayment of the notes after the projects are successfully completed and accepted many projects receive permanent financing through the federal housing administration under fannie mae the federal national mortgage association or ginnie mae the government national mortgage association there are of course a number of other types of notes issued for different purposes and secured differently than those described above municipal bonds which meet longerterm capital needs and generally have maturities of more than one year when issued have two principal classifications general obligation bonds and revenue bonds issuers of general obligation bonds include states counties cities towns and regional districts the proceeds of these obligations are used to fund a wide range of public projects including the construction or improvement of schools highways and roads water and sewer systems and a variety of other public purposes the basic security behind general obligation bonds is the issuers pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest the taxes that can be levied for the payment of debt service may be limited or unlimited as to rate amount or special assessments the principal security for a revenue bond is generally the net revenues derived from a particular facility or group of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source revenue bonds have been issued to fund a wide variety of capital projects including electric gas water and sewer systems highways bridges and tunnels port and airport facilities colleges and universities and hospitals although the principal security behind these bonds varies widely many provide additional security in the form of a debt service reserve fund whose monies may also be used to make principal and interest payments on the issuers obligations housing finance authorities have a wide range of security including partially or fully insured rentsubsidized andor collateralized mortgages andor the net revenues from housing or other public projects in addition to a debt service reserve fund some authorities provide further security in the form of a states ability without obligation to make up deficiencies in the debt reserve fund lease rental bonds issued by a state or local authority for capital projects are secured by annual lease rental payments from the state or locality to the authority sufficient to cover debt service on the authoritys obligations some issues of municipal bonds are payable from united states treasury bonds and notes or agency obligations held in escrow by a trustee frequently a commercial bank the interest and principal on these us government securities are sufficient to pay all interest and principal requirements of the municipal securities when due some escrowed treasury securities are used to retire municipal bonds at their earliest call date while others are used to retire municipal bonds at their maturity securities purchased for a fund may include variablefloating rate instruments variable mode instruments put bonds and other obligations which have a specified maturity date but also are payable before maturity after notice by the holder demand obligations demand obligations are considered for a funds purposes to mature at the demand date there are in addition a variety of hybrid and special types of municipal obligations as well as numerous differences in the security of municipal obligations both within and between the two principal classifications ie notes and bonds discussed above  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th an entire issue of municipal securities may be purchased by one or a small number of institutional investors such as a fund thus such an issue may not be said to be publicly offered unlike the equity securities of operating companies or mutual funds which must be registered under the  act prior to offer and sale unless an exemption from such registration is available municipal securities whether publicly or privately offered may nevertheless be readily marketable a secondary market exists for municipal securities which have been publicly offered as well as securities which have not been publicly offered initially but which may nevertheless be readily marketable municipal securities purchased for a fund are subject to the limitations on holdings of securities which are not readily marketable based on whether it may be sold in a reasonable time consistent with the customs of the municipal markets usually seven days at a price or interest rate which accurately reflects its recorded value a fund believes that the quality standards applicable to their investments enhance marketability in addition standby commitments participation interests and demand obligations also enhance marketability provisions of the federal bankruptcy statutes relating to the adjustment of debts of political subdivisions and authorities of states of the united states provide that in certain circumstances such subdivisions or authorities may be authorized to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without prior notice to or consent of creditors which proceedings could result in material and adverse modification or alteration of the rights of holders of obligations issued by such subdivisions or authorities litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of present systems of financing public education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of states and legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school finances in some states in other instances there has been litigation challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds or the validity of their issuance under state or federal law which litigation could ultimately affect the validity of those municipal securities or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon in some cases municipalities may issue bonds relying on proceeds from litigation settlements these bonds may be further secured by debt service reserve funds established at the time the bonds were issued bonds that are supported in whole or in part by expected litigation proceeds are subject to the risk that part or all of the expected proceeds may not be received for example a damage award could be overturned or reduced by a court or the terms of a settlement or damages award may allow for reduced or discontinued payments if certain conditions are met as a result bonds that rely on proceeds from litigation proceeds are subject to an increased risk of nonpayment or default for the purpose of the funds investment restrictions the identification of the issuer of municipal obligations which are not general obligation bonds is made by the advisor on the basis of the characteristics of the obligation as described above the most significant of which is the source of funds for the payment of principal and interest on such obligations municipal lease obligations and participation interests participation interests represent undivided interests in municipal leases installment purchase contracts conditional sales contracts or other instruments these are typically issued by a trust or other entity which has received an assignment of the payments to be made by the state or political subdivision under such leases or contracts they may be variable rate or fixed rate each fund may purchase from banks participation interests in all or part of specific holdings of municipal obligations provided the participation interest is fully insured each participation is backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of the selling bank that the advisor has determined meets the prescribed quality standards of each fund therefore either the credit of the issuer of the municipal obligation or the selling bank or both will meet the quality standards of the particular fund a fund has the right to sell the participation back to the bank after seven days notice for the full principal amount of a funds interest in the municipal obligation plus accrued interest but only i as required to provide liquidity to a fund ii to maintain a high quality investment portfolio or iii upon a default under the terms of the municipal obligation the selling bank will receive a fee from a fund in connection with the arrangement a fund will not purchase participation interests unless in the opinion of bond counsel counsel for the issuers of such participations or counsel selected by the advisor the interest from such participations is exempt from regular federal income tax and state income tax for a fund a municipal lease obligation may take the form of a lease installment purchase contract or conditional sales contract which is issued by a state or local government and authorities to acquire land equipment and facilities  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th income from such obligations is generally exempt from state and local taxes in the state of issuance municipal lease obligations frequently involve special risks not normally associated with general obligations or revenue bonds leases and installment purchase or conditional sale contracts which normally provide for title in the leased asset to pass eventually to the governmental issuer have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt the debt issuance limitations are deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases or contracts of nonappropriation clauses that relieve the governmental issuer of any obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis in addition such leases or contracts may be subject to the temporary abatement of payments in the event the issuer is prevented from maintaining occupancy of the leased premises or utilizing the leased equipment although the obligations may be secured by the leased equipment or facilities the disposition of the property in the event of nonappropriation or foreclosure might prove difficult time consuming and costly and result in a delay in recovery or the failure to fully recover a funds original investment certain municipal lease obligations and participation interests may be deemed illiquid for the purpose of a funds limitation on investments in illiquid securities other municipal lease obligations and participation interests acquired by a fund may be determined by the advisor to be liquid securities for the purpose of such limitation in determining the liquidity of municipal lease obligations and participation interests the advisor will consider a variety of factors including  the willingness of dealers to bid for the security  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the obligation and the number of other potential buyers  the frequency of trades or quotes for the obligation and  the nature of the marketplace trades in addition the advisor will consider factors unique to particular lease obligations and participation interests affecting the marketability thereof these include the general creditworthiness of the issuer the importance to the issuer of the property covered by the lease and the likelihood that the marketability of the obligation will be maintained throughout the time the obligation is held by a fund a fund may purchase participation interests in municipal lease obligations held by a commercial bank or other financial institution such participations provide a fund with the right to a pro rata undivided interest in the underlying municipal lease obligations in addition such participations generally provide a fund with the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice of all or any part of such funds participation interest in the underlying municipal lease obligation plus accrued interest participation interests a fund may purchase from financial institutions participation interests in securities in which a fund may invest a participation interest gives a fund an undivided interest in the security in the proportion that the funds participation interest bears to the principal amount of the security these instruments may have fixed floating or variable interest rates if the participation interest is unrated or has been given a rating below that which is permissible for purchase by a fund the participation interest will be backed by an irrevocable letter of credit or guarantee of a bank or the payment obligation will be collateralized by us government securities or in the case of unrated participation interest determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality to those instruments in which a fund may invest for certain participation interests a fund will have the right to demand payment on not more than seven days notice for all or any part of a funds participation interests in the security plus accrued interest as to these instruments a fund generally intends to exercise its right to demand payment only upon a default under the terms of the security repurchase agreements a fund may invest in repurchase agreements subject to its investment guidelines in a repurchase agreement a fund acquires ownership of a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller typically a bank or brokerdealer a repurchase agreement provides a means for a fund to earn income on funds for periods as short as overnight it is an arrangement under which the purchaser ie a fund acquires a security obligation and the seller agrees at the time of sale to repurchase the obligation at a specified time and price securities subject to a repurchase agreement are held in a segregated account and as described in more detail below the value of the account is kept at least equal to the repurchase price on a daily basis the repurchase price may be higher than the purchase price the difference being income to a fund or the purchase and repurchase prices may be the same with interest at a stated rate due to a fund together with the repurchase price upon repurchase in either case income to a fund is unrelated  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th to the interest rate on the obligation itself obligations will be held by the custodian or in the federal reserve book entry system it is not clear whether a court would consider the obligation purchased by a fund subject to a repurchase agreement as being owned by a fund or as being collateral for a loan by a fund to the seller in the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the obligation before repurchase of the obligation under a repurchase agreement a fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security delays may involve loss of interest or decline in price of the obligation if the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a fund has not perfected a security interest in the obligation a fund may be required to return the obligation to the sellers estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the seller as an unsecured creditor a fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction as with any unsecured debt obligation purchased for a fund the advisor seeks to reduce the risk of loss through repurchase agreements by analyzing the creditworthiness of the obligor in this case the seller of the obligation apart from the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings there is also the risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the obligation in which case the fund may incur a loss if the proceeds to a fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase price however if the market value including interest of the obligation subject to the repurchase agreement becomes less than the repurchase price including interest a fund will direct the seller of the obligation to deliver additional securities so that the market value including interest of all securities subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price reverse repurchase agreements a fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements which are repurchase agreements in which the fund as the seller of the securities agrees to repurchase such securities at an agreed time and price the fund maintains a segregated account in connection with outstanding reverse repurchase agreements the fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only when the advisor believes that the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction will be greater than the interest expense of the transaction such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and its yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage securities backed by guarantees the fund may invest in securities backed by guarantees from banks insurance companies and other financial institutions a money market funds ability to maintain a stable share price may depend upon such guarantees which are not supported by federal deposit insurance consequently changes in the credit quality of these institutions could have an adverse impact on securities they have guaranteed or backed which could cause losses to a fund and affect its share price standby commitments a standby commitment is a right acquired by a fund when it purchases a municipal obligation from a broker dealer or other financial institution seller to sell up to the same principal amount of such securities back to the seller at a funds option at a specified price standby commitments are also known as puts the investment policies of the dws high yield tax free fund and the dws managed municipal bond fund permit the acquisition of standby commitments solely to facilitate portfolio liquidity the exercise by a fund of a standby commitment is subject to the ability and willingness of the other party to fulfill its contractual commitment standby commitments acquired by a fund will have the following features  they will be in writing and will be physically held by the funds custodian  the funds right to exercise them will be unconditional and unqualified  they will be entered into only with sellers which in the advisors opinion present a minimal risk of default  although standby commitments will not be transferable municipal obligations purchased subject to such commitments may be sold to a third party at any time even though the commitment is outstanding and  their exercise price will be i a funds acquisition cost excluding any accrued interest which a fund paid on their acquisition less any amortized market premium or plus any amortized original issue discount during the period the fund owned the securities plus ii all interest accrued on the securities since the last interest payment date the funds expect that standby commitments generally will be available without the payment of any direct or indirect consideration however if necessary or advisable a fund will pay for standby commitments either separately in cash or by paying a higher price for portfolio securities which are acquired subject to the commitments  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th it is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential benefit of a standby commitment therefore it is expected that the advisor will determine that standby commitments ordinarily have a fair value of zero regardless of whether any direct or indirect consideration was paid however if the market price of the security subject to the standby commitment is less than the exercise price of the standby commitment such security will ordinarily be valued at such exercise price where a fund has paid for a standby commitment its cost will be reflected as unrealized depreciation for the period during which the commitment is held the advisor understands that the internal revenue service the service has issued a favorable revenue ruling to the effect that under specified circumstances a registered investment company will be the owner of taxexempt municipal obligations acquired subject to a put option the service has also issued private letter rulings to certain taxpayers which do not serve as precedent for other taxpayers to the effect that taxexempt interest received by a regulated investment company with respect to such obligations will be taxexempt in the hands of the company and may be distributed to its shareholders as exemptinterest dividends the service has subsequently announced that it will not ordinarily issue advance ruling letters as to the identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities or participation interests therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the security or the participation interest therein to be purchased by either the seller or a third party a fund intends to take the position that it owns any municipal obligations acquired subject to a standby commitment and that taxexempt interest earned with respect to such municipal obligations will be taxexempt in its hands there is no assurance that the service will agree with such position in any particular case strategic transactions and derivatives a fund may but is not required to utilize various other investment strategies as described below for a variety of purposes such as hedging various market risks managing the effective maturity or duration of the funds portfolio or enhancing potential gain these strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts in the course of pursuing these investment strategies the funds may purchase and sell exchangelisted and over the counter put and call options on securities fixedincome indices and other financial instruments purchase and sell futures contracts and options thereon and enter into various transactions such as swaps caps floors or collars collectively all the above are called strategic transactions in addition strategic transactions may also include new techniques instruments or strategies that are permitted as regulatory changes occur strategic transactions may be used without limit except to the extent that  of each funds net assets are required to be invested in taxexempt municipal securities and as limited by each funds other investment restrictions and subject to certain limits imposed by the  act to attempt to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or to be purchased for a funds portfolio resulting from securities markets fluctuations to protect the funds unrealized gains in the value of its portfolio securities to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment purposes to manage the effective maturity or duration of a funds portfolio or to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a temporary substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities some strategic transactions may also be used to enhance potential gain although no more than  of each funds assets will be committed to strategic transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and in any combination and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another as use of any strategic transaction is a function of numerous variables including market conditions the ability of the funds to utilize these strategic transactions successfully will depend on the advisors ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the funds will comply with applicable regulatory requirements when implementing these strategies techniques and instruments strategic transactions will not be used to alter fundamental investment purposes and characteristics of a fund and a fund will segregate assets or as provided by applicable regulations enter into certain offsetting positions to cover its obligations under options futures and swaps to limit leveraging of a fund strategic transactions including derivative contracts have risks associated with them including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the advisors view as to certain market movements is incorrect the risk that the use of such strategic transactions could result in losses greater than if they had not been used use of put and call options may result in losses to a fund force the sale or purchase of portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices higher than in the case of put options or lower than in the case of call options current market values limit the amount of appreciation a fund can realize on its investments or cause a fund to hold a security it might otherwise sell the use of options and futures transactions entails certain other risks in particular  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the variable degree of correlation between price movements of futures contracts and price movements in the related portfolio position of a fund creates the possibility that losses on the hedging instrument may be greater than gains in the value of that funds position in addition futures and options markets may not be liquid in all circumstances and certain overthecounter options may have no markets as a result in certain markets a fund might not be able to close out a transaction without incurring substantial losses if at all although the use of futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position at the same time they tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of such position finally the daily variation margin requirements for futures contracts would create a greater ongoing potential financial risk than would purchase of options where the exposure is limited to the cost of the initial premium losses resulting from the use of strategic transactions would reduce net asset value and possibly income and such losses can be greater than if the strategic transactions had not been utilized general characteristics of options put options and call options typically have similar structural characteristics and operational mechanics regardless of the underlying instrument on which they are purchased or sold thus the following general discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed in greater detail below in addition many strategic transactions involving options require segregation of fund assets in special accounts as described below under use of segregated and other special accounts a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance a funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving a fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument an american style put or call option may be exercised at any time during the option period while a european style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto each fund is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets otc options are purchased from or sold to securities dealers financial institutions or other parties counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparty in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting a fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to a fund at a formula price within seven days a fund expects generally to enter into otc options that have cash settlement provisions although it is not required to do so unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly the advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied a fund will engage in otc option transactions only with us government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers or brokerdealers domestic or foreign banks or other financial institutions which have received or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received a shortterm credit rating of a from sp or p from moodys or an equivalent rating from any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro or in the case of otc currency transactions are determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor the staff of the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it the cost of the sellback plus the inthemoney amount if any are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities if a fund sells a call option the premium that it receives may serve as a partial hedge to the extent of the option premium against a decrease in the value of the underlying securities or instruments in its portfolio or will increase a funds income the sale of put options can also provide income a fund may purchase and sell call options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities municipal obligations mortgagebacked securities and eurodollar instruments that are traded on us and foreign securities exchanges and in the overthecounter markets and on securities indices and futures contracts all calls sold by a fund must be covered ie a fund must own the securities or futures contract subject to the call or must meet the asset segregation requirements described below as long as the call is outstanding even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes a fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument which it might otherwise have sold a fund may purchase and sell put options on among other things securities including us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities municipal obligations and eurodollar instruments whether or not it holds the above securities in its portfolio and on securities indices and futures contracts other than futures on individual corporate debt and individual equity securities a fund will not sell put options if as a result more than  of such funds assets would be required to be segregated to cover its potential obligations under such put options other than those with respect to futures and options thereon in selling put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price general characteristics of futures a fund may enter into futures contracts or purchase or sell put and call options on such futures as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or fixedincome market changes and for duration management risk management and return enhancement purposes futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer the specific type of financial instrument called for in the contract at a specific future time for a specified price or with respect to certain instruments such as index futures and eurodollar instruments the net cash amount and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified price options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position each fund has claimed exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act therefore the funds are not subject to commodity pool operator registration and regulation under the commodity exchange act futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide hedging risk management including duration management or other portfolio and return enhancement management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon requires a fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the marktomarket value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of options on financial futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of a fund if a fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price nor that delivery will occur a fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of a funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation the segregation requirements with respect to futures contracts and options thereon are described below swaps caps floors and collars among the strategic transactions into which a fund may enter are interest rate index and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars a fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio as a duration management technique to protect against any increase in the price of securities that a fund anticipates purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns a fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream a fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values a fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with a fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments a fund will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the counterparty combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from an nrsro or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by the advisor if there is a default by the counterparty a fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps use of segregated and other special accounts many strategic transactions in addition to other requirements require that a fund segregate cash or liquid assets with its custodian to the extent fund obligations are not otherwise covered through ownership of the underlying security financial instrument or currency in general either the full amount of any obligation by a fund to pay or deliver securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities instruments or currency required to be delivered or subject to any regulatory restrictions an amount of cash or liquid assets at least equal to the current amount of the obligation must be segregated with the custodian the segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them for example a call option written by a fund will require a fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by a fund on an index will require that fund to own portfolio securities which correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by a fund requires a fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price except when a fund enters into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a particular currency which requires no segregation a currency contract which obligates a fund to buy or sell currency will generally require that fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets denominated in that currency equal to a funds obligations or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the amount of a funds obligation otc options entered into by a fund including those on securities currency financial instruments or indices and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when a fund sells these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by a fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when a fund sells a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price a fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by a fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and a fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery in the case of a futures contract or an option thereon a fund must deposit initial margin and possible daily variation margin in addition to segregating cash or liquid assets sufficient to meet its obligation to purchase or provide securities or currencies or to pay the amount owed at the expiration of an indexbased futures contract such liquid assets may consist of cash cash equivalents liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets with respect to swaps a fund will accrue the net amount of the excess if any of its obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal to the accrued excess caps floors and collars require segregation of assets with a value equal to a funds net obligation if any strategic transactions may be covered by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies a fund may also enter into offsetting transactions so that its combined position coupled with any segregated assets equals its net outstanding obligation in related options and strategic transactions for example a fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by a fund moreover instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if a fund held a futures or forward contract it could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held other strategic transactions may also be offset in combinations if the offsetting transaction  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd terminates at the time of or after the primary transaction no segregation is required but if it terminates prior to such time cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated taxexempt custodial receipts the dws managed municipal bond fund may purchase taxexempt custodial receipts the receipts which evidence ownership in an underlying bond that is deposited with a custodian for safekeeping holders of the receipts receive all payments of principal and interest when paid on the bonds receipts can be purchased in an offering or from a counterparty typically an investment bank to the extent that any receipt is illiquid it is subject to the funds limit on illiquid securities tax exempt passthrough securities the dws high yield tax free fund may purchase tax exempt passthrough certificates these represent an interest in a pool or group of fixedrate longterm debt obligations issued by or on behalf of primarily notforprofit institutions the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation including alternative minimum taxation such fixedrate longterm debt obligations may be private activity bonds issued by states municipalities or public authorities to provide funds usually through a loan or lease arrangement to a nonprofit corporation for the purpose of financing or refinancing the construction or improvement of a facility to be used by the nonprofit corporation distributions on tax exempt passthrough certificates may be adversely affected by defaults in or prepayment of the underlying debt obligations certain tax exempt passthrough certificates are issued in several classes with different levels of yields and credit protection the fund may invest in lower classes of tax exempt passthrough certificates that have less credit protection tax exempt passthrough certificates have limited liquidity and certain transfer restrictions may apply there currently is no trading market for tax exempt passthrough certificates and there can be no assurance that such a market will develop third party puts a fund may purchase longterm fixed rate bonds that have been coupled with an option granted by a third party financial institution allowing a fund at specified intervals to tender or put the bonds to the institution and receive the face value thereof plus accrued interest these third party puts are available in several different forms may be represented by custodial receipts or trust certificates and may be combined with other features such as interest rate swaps that fund receives a shortterm rate of interest which is periodically reset and the interest rate differential between that rate and the fixed rate on the bond is retained by the financial institution the financial institution granting the option does not provide credit enhancement and in the event that there is a default in the payment of principal or interest or downgrading of a bond to below investment grade or a loss of the bonds taxexempt status the put option will terminate automatically the risk to that fund will be that of holding such a longterm bond and the weighted average maturity of a funds portfolio would be adversely affected these bonds coupled with puts may present the same tax issues as are associated with standby commitments as with any standby commitments acquired by a fund the fund intends to take the position that it is the owner of any municipal obligation acquired subject to a thirdparty put and that taxexempt interest earned with respect to such municipal obligations will be taxexempt in its hands there is no assurance that the service will agree with such position in any particular case additionally the federal income tax treatment of certain other aspects of these investments including the treatment of tender fees and swap payments in relation to various regulated investment company tax provisions is unclear however the advisor seeks to manage a funds portfolio in a manner designed to minimize any adverse impact from these investments us government securities there are two broad categories of us governmentrelated debt instruments a direct obligations of the us treasury and b securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies examples of direct obligations of the us treasury are treasury bills notes bonds and other debt securities issued by the us treasury these instruments are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states they differ primarily in interest rates the length of maturities and the dates of issuance treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less treasury notes have original maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have original maturities of greater than ten years some agency securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states such as maritime administration title xi ship financing bonds and agency for international development housing guarantee program bonds and others are backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury such as federal home loan bank bonds and federal national mortgage association bonds while still others such as the securities of the federal  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd farm credit bank are supported only by the credit of the issuer with respect to securities supported only by the credit of the issuing agency or by an additional line of credit with the us treasury there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest us government securities may include zero coupon securities that have been stripped by the us government of their unmatured interest coupons and collateralized obligations issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or instrumentality interest rates on us government obligations may be fixed or variable interest rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular intervals at least annually according to a formula reflecting thencurrent specified standard rates such as day us treasury bill rates these adjustments generally tend to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities the government guarantee of the us government securities in a funds portfolio does not guarantee the net asset value of the shares of that fund there are market risks inherent in all investments in securities and the value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate over time normally the value of investments in us government securities varies inversely with changes in interest rates for example as interest rates rise the value of investments in us government securities will tend to decline and as interest rates fall the value of a funds investments will tend to increase in addition the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased principal prepayments with respect to certain mortgagebacked securities such as gnma certificates prepayments of high interest rate mortgagebacked securities during times of declining interest rates will tend to lower the return of a fund and may even result in losses to a fund if some securities were acquired at a premium moreover during periods of rising interest rates prepayments of mortgagebacked securities may decline resulting in the extension of a funds average portfolio maturity as a result a funds portfolio may experience greater volatility during periods of rising interest rates than under normal market conditions whenissued securities a fund may from time to time purchase equity and debt securities on a whenissued delayed delivery or forward delivery basis the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities takes place at a later date during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by a fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to a fund when a fund purchases such securities it immediately assumes the risks of ownership including the risk of price fluctuation failure to deliver a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment to the extent that assets of a fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities a fund would earn no income while such securities may be sold prior to the settlement date the funds intend to purchase them with the purpose of actually acquiring them unless a sale appears desirable for investment reasons at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase a security on this basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the market value of the securities may be more or less than the purchase price masterfeeder fund structure the board of trustees has the discretion to retain the current distribution arrangement for a fund while investing in a master fund in a masterfeeder fund structure as described below a masterfeeder fund structure is one in which a fund a feeder fund instead of investing directly in a portfolio of securities invests most or all of its investment assets in a separate registered investment company the master fund with substantially the same investment objective and policies as the feeder fund such a structure permits the pooling of assets of two or more feeder funds preserving separate identities or distribution channels at the feeder fund level based on the premise that certain of the expenses of operating an investment portfolio are relatively fixed a larger investment portfolio may eventually achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average net assets an existing investment company is

believes more favorable results are available elsewhere transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices purchases of underwritten issues will include an underwriting fee paid to the underwriter money market instruments are normally purchased in principal transactions directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker it is likely that the brokerdealers selected based on the considerations described in this section will include firms that also sell shares of the funds to their customers however the advisor does not consider sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds and accordingly has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of shares of the funds as a factor in the selection of brokerdealers to execute portfolio transactions for the funds the advisor is permitted by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act when placing portfolio transactions for a fund to cause the fund to pay brokerage commissions in excess of that which another brokerdealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain research and brokerage services if the advisor determines that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the overall services provided the advisor may from time to time in reliance on section e of the  act execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers that provide research and brokerage services to the advisor consistent with the advisors policy regarding best execution where more than one broker is believed to be capable of providing best execution for a particular trade the advisor may take into consideration the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the brokerdealer to execute the trade although certain research and brokerage services from brokerdealers may be useful to a fund and to the advisor it is the opinion of the advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since the information must still be analyzed weighed and reviewed by the advisors staff research and brokerage services received from a brokerdealer may be useful to the advisor in providing services to clients other than the fund making the trade and not all such information is used by the

simultaneous transactions are inevitable to the extent permitted by law the advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased for a fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in executing transactions purchases or sales are then averaged as to price and commission and allocated as to amount in a manner deemed equitable to each account while in some cases this practice could have a detrimental effect on the price paid or received by or on the size of the position obtained or disposed of for the fund in other cases it is believed that the ability to engage

most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities a bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments
