is no guarantee of future results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of

consider that the statistics on the “do it yourself” approach are not encouraging findings by morningstar a leading mutual fund research firm compared mutual fund returns with the gains investors

low the study covered  years through the end of  and found that funds posted an average annualized return of  compared with a  average return realized by investors the returns factor in all stock and bond funds that morningstar tracks investor returns are weighted based on asset flows into and out of all share classes of openend mutual funds tracked by morningstar although a gap of a single percentage point may not seem like a big difference it can make a significant impact over the long term thanks to compounding in fact a hypothetical  investment returning an average of  annually would produce a total of  over  years compared with  for an average annual return of  over the same period over  years the gap becomes even wider  for the  return vs  for the  return returns based on a hypothetical  initial investment what is the reason for the gap between fund returns and investor returns financial researchers say the difference is largely attributable to investors buying funds when times are good and then selling when troubles arise once out of the market investors often don’t get back in the market in time to capture much of the later upturn in stock prices stock market volatility makes the problem worse fear can drive investors out of the market or cause them to make emotional decisions that could have longterm consequences for their portfolios a financial advisor
