construction incorporated chief executive officer jim roberts james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thank you ron and good morning everyone it is with great pleasure today that i have the privilege to speak with you about our improved performance in the fourth quarter and throughout  it is a great pleasure today that i congratulate and thank granite teams across the country for delivering improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout  and it is with great pleasure today that i thank congress for finally doing their job in december and passing the first longterm federal highway bill in the decade the fast act but before i comment on public funding trends and the requisite opportunities and challenges they present lets start today by discussing the successes and challenges in our business  was a successful year and it is reflected in our results certainly the market has improved but our teams are working more safely and efficiently and it is paying dividends lets dive into the business beginning with construction materials in  we suggested that the materials business was the leading indicator for our vertically integrated business two years later quarterly segment profit margin has improved in six of the past seven quarters and annual gross profit margin more than tripled from about  in  to more than  in  while pricing has increased over the past couple of years the majority of materials improvement is related to higher volumes notably volume has a long way to go to reach the previous peak production levels we experienced  years to  years ago but perhaps most importantly this business is continuing on a path of improved quality efficiency cost savings and a renewed customer focus these important recurring efforts are enabling this portion of our business to continue on its path of steady profitable growth despite a continued environment of lukewarm public spending trends for at least the past five years construction segment margins have traveled a similar path as materials nearly doubling from about  in  to a very respectable level of about  in  in fact the fourth quarter of  marks the seventh consecutive quarter and the th quarter out of the past  quarters with yearoveryear gross margin improvement in the segment we are pleased but not satisfied with this recovery certain markets in the west and strong contributions from our power and underground businesses helped segment profitability nearly double at  in the quarter this standout performance was key to our results in the fourth quarter construction markets have recovered from the bottom but bidding remains highly competitive across geographies and across end markets once again our success in construction follows a similar path as in materials as we executed the past few years on our strategic plan the relentless focus on safety execution diversification and continuous improvement all contributed to our results importantly we continue to work to improve pricing which unfortunately tends to move north more slowly than when it moves south our leaders are committed to increasing prices in all areas of our business throughout local markets opportunities in power underground and continuing strength in the overall commercial market are combining to fuel improved gross margins increased focus and attention in these areas the past few years is yielding results contributing strongly to top and bottom line growth in the construction segment even in the tepid public spending environments of the past few years now moving to the large project segment business performance improved in the second half of  after a challenging start to the year in the first half of  weather and project challenges some within our control and some not ultimately left us well short of the project progress we had anticipated for the year granite teams across the country continue to execute on more than  billion of segment backlog as our bidding activity continues to pay dividends with recent wins on the loop  south mountain freeway in phoenix and the alabama i i interchange in birmingham these projects are expected to contribute more than  million to segment backlog in the first quarter the tappan zee bridge the ihe in texas the i ultimate in florida and the pennsylvania rapid bridge replacement continue to represent the majority of segment revenue at the end of  only the tappan zee and ihe projects have reached the halfway point of completion with early stage jobs still comprising the majority of segment revenue we continue to expect margins to remain lower than when they mature through the project lifecycle over the next few years unfortunately a number of projects nearing completion performed below expectations which also contributed to weaker than expected performance in  as projects mature and as we are able to mitigate risks both project and segment profitability should improve while we expect improvement in  from the segment gross profit margin we posted in  we believe it will be  before the project portfolio mix again can produce margins in the midteens range our longterm project expectation it is always difficult to pinpoint specific timing but were confident that we are managing appropriately to improve performance in our large projects business challenging and sometimes unprofitable projects occur and even in the past decade our project portfolio has produced quite variable results especially on a quartertoquarter basis over that time our large project portfolio has delivered returns in line with our expectations in the midteens now turning to the business of winning new business we bid on more than  billion of large projects in the fourth quarter with successes in arizona and alabama representing more than  billion of project value for granite teams a hit rate in line with our segment expectations these wins and our existing backlog allow us to be more selective in our upcoming bid list in  the lions share of remaining bidding is in the back half of the year but our list of prospects remains long we expect to bid on more than  billion of large projects through the end of next year this competitive market continues to produce robust and diverse bidding opportunities that allow granite to better prioritize the work we want to bid win and build now lets shift for just a few minutes to the alwayscritical topic of public funding lets start with the good news from washington dc the fast act is here remember though that this represents a starting point for granite and for an industry that has been starved of consistent funding for many many years we do not expect a significant change to the nearterm competitive environment but we do expect the initial impact to show up for granite in the second half of  in the form of more bidding activity than we have seen in many years which rapidly could change the capacity and pricing landscape and we expect bidding activity to gain momentum especially in  which should help accelerate additional growth but the fast act alone is not a panacea because while nearly two dozen states have taken action since  to address transportation funding shortfall little of these new funds have yet to reach the street we believe that a change in focus and commitment is gaining momentum but the disparity of commitment from state to state remains troubling and many state and municipal entities have underinvested for so long that massive catchups remain a necessity illustrating the stark differences in transportation funding trends from state to state are texas and california last november texas voters approved proposition  which is expected to provide an additional  billion a year for the texas department of transportation in an annual transfer from the texas general fund and this is after voters approved a separate greater than  billion per year transportation funding ballot measure in  called proposition  this critical commitment to investment unfortunately is offset by chronic inaction and inefficiency in california californias system is at least bruised if not broken even as state revenues have swelled again to record levels transportation spending continues to decline across the state the list of projects on the chopping block due to spending woes continues to grow and in the shadow of a budget surplus gas taxes here are set and adjusted annually based on an arcane revenue neutral system with a  base the result the california board of equalization just this week approved a third consecutive annual reduction in gas taxes this time  down to  from july of  through june of  a  reduction from  motorists paid in  and it results in an estimated  million less to spend on transportation projects in california next fiscal year for california today it is hard to move forward when it is stuck in reverse please dont get me wrong we remain extremely constructive about the coming opportunities here in california unfortunately i am less confident now that action will be taken in the first half of this year than i was last fall when i presented to the california legislatures special session conference governor browns  billion year transportation funding enhancement plan remains on the table as do a number of individually submitted bills all of which are larger than the governors proposal but the timing of any significant commitment in california remains uncertain i remain hopeful that  can be the launch point for this critical investment over the past few years we invested in becoming a stronger smarter more efficient company by looking inwardly to challenge ourselves to be better even in light of some extremely challenging market conditions and we are not finished we still have a long way to go to be satisfied that we are generating steady growing operating and financial results with last years results in mind we set our sights on improved performance in  in an environment of steady but modest growth however we expect both company and industry growth to accelerate in  and in  so with that i will turn the call over to laurel to discuss more details of our results and our  outlook laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you jim and good morning everyone fourth quarter  revenue was  million up  from last year with fiscal year  revenue increasing  to about  billion earnings per share increased  in the fourth quarter of  to  up from  last year and  eps more than doubled to  per share compared to  in  total company  gross profit margin was  in the fourth quarter and were particularly pleased with the more than  basis point margin improvement in  to  during the quarter and throughout  improved results were driven by particular strength in the construction and construction materials segments sga expenses increased in  to  million driven primarily by personnelrelated costs contract backlog totaled  billion at the end of  up  from  billion last year large project construction backlog increased about  yearoveryear to more than  billion with construction backlog increasing nearly  in  to more than  million and as jim mentioned this does not include our portion of the arizona project the alabama project and additional business resulting from early season win rates tracking well ahead of the last couple of years looking at the segment detail fourth quarter construction segment revenue increased more than  to  million with  construction revenue improving  to  billion in the fourth quarter segment gross profit margin improved more than  basis points yearoveryear to  in  construction gross profit margin improved more than  basis points to just over  returning to what we would consider healthy level for the first time in many years we are excited and encouraged by this performance moving now to large project construction where segment revenues increased  in the quarter to  million and fiscal year  revenues decreased  to  million fourth quarter segment margin declined about  basis points from last year to  with  segment margin finishing at  down about  basis points  performance reflects the timing of overall project portfolio progression coupled with execution issues on certain projects fourth quarter  segment gross profit included initial profit recognition and dispute resolution of more than  million as jim mentioned we continue to target midteens margins over the life of projects and we do expect some improvement in  from the gross margins we posted in  but we expect it will be  before we can again produce margins in the midteens range fourth quarter  construction materials segment revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million for a second straight year in  materials revenue increased double digits to nearly  million quarterly segment gross profit margin surged to  up more than  basis points from last year this was a strong contributor to the nearly  basis points of yearoveryear margin improvement to  in  revenue and profit growth was driven primarily by improved volumes with aggregate pricing and production efficiency gains also contributing to the performance finally lets turn to our outlook and guidance last february we suggested that revenue would grow midsingle digits and ebitda margin would improve to finish in a range of  to  we also suggested that our profitability would improve fairly in line with  how did we do revenue increased  check ebitda margin increased  check gross profit improved more than  million for a second consecutive year with net income of more than  million in  after improving nearly  million the year before check  is on desk now with the benefit of the strong foundation we built with our solid  performance we entered  with the balance of potential headwinds and tailwinds shaping our opportunities certainly todays very real transportation funding issues in california contribute to the challenge of tepid public funding trends but this is balanced with a potential late  positive impact to market from the fast act while we expect large project margins to remain below our longterm trends in  we do this while executing on continued near record backlog of  billion of course we continue to expect to benefit from ongoing execution improvement and efficiency gains across our business and our materials business continues to strengthen in light of these factors we currently expect midsingledigit consolidated revenue growth in  with ebitda margin in a range of  to  and quite pleasingly growth acceleration in  is now in our sight now before we take your questions let me turn the call back to jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thank you laurel today we are executing more effectively on the foundation we built and shaped during the difficult times of the past five years to leverage coming growth opportunities as was a case at this time last year we are focused on capturing and executing on broad opportunities across geographies and end markets we will continue to emphasize strong cost control and strategic investment as we build on consecutive years of improved operational and financial performance and now well be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator our first question is from mr jerry revich of goldman sachs brandon jaffe  goldman sachs  co thanks this is actually brandon jaffe on behalf of jerry its clear that you are positive on the longterm impact to the highway bill but in the press release youve made some cautionary comments about the near term can you just talk about what concerns you in the context of relatively healthy dot budgets james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay you bet my concern always any time any kind of a public spending bill gets passed is how quickly it can be put into place and if you look at historically what a federal highway bill it will take time to get that work typically put into play and bid and physically awarded to contractors and then you wont see the physical financial results of it until probably two quarters or three quarters later so when we give a little cautionary statement about the federal highway bill its mostly relative to the timing and i state that the back half of the year is when we will see some positive results from it we are already seeing the opportunity with some designs and things coming out to play but it doesnt hit the financials to later in the year brandon jaffe  goldman sachs  co okay thanks and your construction backlog is at pretty healthy levels entering  which has usually been positive for the margin profile earlier in the year how should we be thinking about the margins in that segment for  james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think that you are right the backlog in construction is quite a bit from the previous year and its a mix which is really nice to see its not just dot type work weve expanded the businesses the power business has a lot of work in the construction segment the underground business has a lot of work in that segment and weve actually expanded the constriction segment into the private sector renewable energy is a big deal of the day and so is the commercial markets commercial markets are coming back so we expect in the long term weve always said somewhere around  to  we are very pleased with  last year that is a healthy type of margin for our standard construction segment but i think you are right what happens in these markets is that when there is a lot of backlog and people ill talk about competitors first when they have a healthy backlog then the pricing changes and i mentioned that in the script that it takes a saturation point in the market place to get pricing to change and more backlog at the beginning of the year means that that pricing differential could occur in the second quarter could occur in the third quarter quite not sure yet but the same point is i think the midteens are very healthy margin in the construction business brandon jaffe  goldman sachs  co thank you james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay operator the next questioner will be michael dudas of sterne agee go ahead michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc good morning gentlemen laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning mike michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc jim to amplify on your california comment so is that – obviously it seems like it changed from what your anticipation was second half of last year is there an actual frustration or is it just like pushed out timing where some of those moneys can get liberated to hit the street second half of this year and is that part of maybe the cautionary headwind discussion that you put through in your prepared remarks james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director hey when you mentioned mike – when you mentioned frustration the answer is yes and yes michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc okay sure james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director so i was very hopeful last year that we had some serious momentum in california with the special session appointed by the governor that they would act and get something done and they had real momentum and then it died over the holidays we are back on and we are moving very heavily in california to get a transportation bill that is somewhere between the governors minimal proposal of  billion up to proposals on the street today that are up to  billion annually its not a matter of if in california its a matter of when and everybody knows that its just as always in politics timing is very difficult to figure out but i do think mike that well get something passed in  now whether or not and i will call this the headwind whether or not we get to see the value of it is questionable in  thats why i mentioned an acceleration in  because i think again whether its the state or the fed the states move a little faster than the feds but it will still take a quarter to two quarters to get those projects out on the street out to bid and in companys backlogs so i am frustrated with the speed but i am confident that we will get a large transportation bill in california michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc turning to your large project business it seems through the optimism is well placed and there is quite a bit of bidding opportunity for granite and youve had some very early success during the last couple months how are you looking to manage the timing and the opportunities in those businesses given where you are in the four that you are operating now and kind of rolling off project teams on one to another is it something that you can look to accelerate if things work out well and you get more wins or is there something youre going to be looking to really pick the ones where you can get the best margin not be so aggressive on the volume side james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director i think its a little bit of both i think first – certainly i mentioned it in the script mike that we want to be more selective number one and we want to make sure that the projects that we bid win and build provide the returns that we expect in that midteen range in large projects but secondarily we also know that we have to grow that part of the business and we are promoting from within we are putting our people on strategic positions and jobs so that theyre capable to run bigger jobs down the road in the very near future so its a combination of both that business has the opportunities to grow but the key to success in that large projects business is a very methodical growth ive seen many companies that get themselves in trouble by growing that business too fast and that would be a problem the other thing in that part of that business is that you have to team up with the right partners when you are on mega jobs and thats really important to pick the right partners the ones that work well with our company and the ones that have the same level of expectation that we do on those projects so we are very comfortable that its a market thats growing and our job is to just select the right projects the right partners and demand the right kind of margins on those projects michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc thanks jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director you bet mike operator the next questioner is mike shlisky of seaport global please go ahead michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc good everybody james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning mike michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc i wanted to touch first on your  outlook for perhaps construction materials do you expect a rapid acceleration there in  or is that also going to wait until perhaps  to see the actual percent get a little higher there james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay well the materials business is and i mentioned it also in the script its kind of the leading indicator of whats going on in the economy it kind of hits the first barrage of private sector involvement in the economy and its healthy and its going to stay healthy now how fast it improves from where it is today i think its going to be very methodical again i dont see an inflection point yet because what you need to get an inflection point in the materials business is both the private sector click in and the public sector click in i actually think today the private sector has gained more momentum over the last couple of years than the public sector has but as i mentioned mike when you start running into the end of this year and the public sector starts ticking in with the fast act and some of these state individual acts then i think youre going to start seeing the materials business move fairly quickly and weve had years in that materials business where weve been in the highteen margins as you can tell now were in the lowteen margins so there is quite a ways of upward movements still to go but its going to take both the private and public sector in line at the same time to get there michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc okay great i also wanted to ask about your sga laurel has that i missed it but in the fourth quarter it was the highest it has been in a bunch of years looking back through history can you maybe just give us some more color as to what happened in the fourth quarter and then secondly maybe like how that might be – how we should look at the  run rate there id appreciate that thanks laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president okay the biggest driver of the increase in sga is personnelrelated costs primarily incentive comps and then the typical normal increase in salaries and burden as far as how you should look at it i would say at about the same percentage of revenue as we currently have our objective is to grow revenue without growing sga a lot so we want to pull the percentage that we have and begin to work that down as we grow the top line michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc great thank you so much guys laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you very much mike operator the next question comes from nick coppola of thompson research go ahead nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc hi good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning nick laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc so first question would be on the construction segment the  gross margin is obviously quite strong can you talk more about the drivers of that improvement maybe help parse out for us james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think that as i mentioned a little bit nick earlier the private sectors driving that theres just no doubt about it the expansion in the commercial markets the renewable markets the underground markets with some private clients has really jumped up in the last  months and so thats whats driving the big returns today and thats whats going to drive the bigger returns down the road the dots and the public sector markets are typically more commodity markets that drive lower gpms but i actually think that the private sectors growing nicely and although i wouldnt expect  every quarter as i mentioned you get into the midteen margins in construction and youre doing a really nice job so the granite teams did a really nice job in  and i also think that our people are just doing a better job in the field theyre executing at a substantially higher level weve enacted our continuous improvement program and the people in granite are just taking the execution issues to heart and theyre just operating better than their competitors and that does make a huge difference in a couple of points here and there in the construction business and as you can see when you can move up into a  margin that means youre executing at a high level the other thing that happened in the west which is where most of our construction work is is there was a pretty mild winter through december we didnt get a lot of rain we got a lot of rain in january but on the whole west coast we had nice weather and they got to operate consistently through say middecember which makes it a nice fourth quarter so that does help nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc all right well thats great to see and then second question here can you talk more about what youre seeing in the state of washington particularly as a result of that year bill that was done there james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah so remember what they did up there last year they passed a year – or a year  billion bill – yeah  and  thats right so it was  billion a year we are seeing releases already one thing that will happen in a state like washington any of the northern states that have a winter attached to them what youll see is a very competitive bidding environment in the first quarter youll see lots of work out to bid typically and youll see more bidders in the first quarter so i think its yet to be determined nick exactly how that  billion a year additional program will hit the street how it will affect the bidding environment but the washington market is healthy its got a very strong private sector its very diversified from the east to the west the cascades lie in between and i think youre going to see that continue to make it healthier especially when the fast act ties in at the same time later on in the year thats going to be a really nice addition to the washington program because as i mentioned before i see the fast act starting to hit the streets in the third and fourth quarter of this year and then you got the  billion a year program on the wash dot on top of that i think you are going to see washington do some really nice things nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc excellent thanks for taking my question james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay very good thanks operator the next question comes from alex rygiel of fbr go ahead alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co good morning and thanks for taking my question jim could you talk a little bit more in depth with regards to the material sales business and where pricing is today relative to the past peak james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah sure alex so the business is – we ought to break it in granite into two components for our materials business first of all the aggregates business which is much easier to track because you have a very static number of inputs to it you have aggregates youre extracting from the ground and you are using a host of different methodologies to crush and make product those products have risen in pricing somewhere i would say  to  last year we see similar type increases this year maybe more and its a nice methodical market and i like where its going i think that could have an inflection point later in the year again if we start seeing the volume demand from both private and public hitting at the same time we havent seen that yet but we have seen a healthy volume increase about  yeartoyear in that end of the market which is healthy which has helped the pricing now the second part of the business is a very interesting part of the business and thats the asphalt business the asphalt business as you would imagine is driven heavily by crude pricing which liquid asphalt is a major component of asphalt and its the bottom of the barrel out of the refinery and as those prices dropped tremendously over the last  months so therefore has the pricing for asphalt the key ingredient there is to be able to not price the asphalt with the full reduction in price of liquid and capture some upside in the gross profit margin and our businesses have been able to do that and i think theyre going to continue to be able to do that that is a very healthy market as well but what happens with the asphalt market is the big volume from that market is typically driven by public projects you get very large well call them asphalt overlays and whether granite does them or a third party we really like to sell products in the very large arenas there so that we can get some fixed volumes out in our plants so i think again in the materials business and the asphalt business especially once you see the public sector gearing up and you start seeing more of the surface work coming into play i think youre going to see that part of the materials business the asphalt side maybe reach an inflection point at the end of this year or beginning of next year alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co thanks and jim you referenced that granites likely going to be bidding on something like  billion worth of large projects in  and  how does that number compare to maybe the past month period james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director its pretty much in line it might be down a little bit but what happens is that we have a whole bunch of them in the hopper that we havent made our minds up on yet so you could get one  billion project and go through what we call our large projects committee and get it approved and then it would change it would add  billion to that list i would suggest this alex it is robust were being very choosy and were turning opportunities away and the amount of work that were going to bid is going to be in line with what our capabilities are alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co very helpful thank you james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director you bet operator the next question comes from william bremer of maxim group go ahead william bremer  maxim group llc good morning gentlemen and laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning william bremer  maxim group llc so i want to add on the last couple of questions jim lets go to the pricing as well as your capacity and help us understand how you are bidding trying to balance not overextending yourselves near term james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay thats an interesting question because thats what we used to chat about  years ago do we have a capacity issue is there some saturation point in your business that you are going to not be able to do any more and you are going to turn and walk away and the key ingredient is exactly what you said is that you start optimizing your margin expectations long before you reach a saturation point so that you dont fill yourself up with lower margin work and then lose the opportunities in the higher margin work ill tell you with the businesses that we have across the country we have a huge opportunity to increase the amount of work we do in the construction materials segment we are nowhere near capacity but it is smart business to watch what goes on in the markets and not reach capacity too quickly because what we have seen historically is that our competitors are smaller they have less elasticity in their business and they tend to fill up faster when the markets improve and then there is a significant change in the pricing and thats that inflection point so i dont see a capacity issue for granite today i think that it is a good business to continually move prices up find out where that pressure point is and i think we are going to be working that very hard over the next – in  william bremer  maxim group llc okay good color there thank you my followup is overall on labor and hiring at this point are you seeing labor starting to tweak up here or due to the fallout of the shales do you feel more in essence that its contained james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well ill say its both you are getting some other industries there is an influx of workers from the other industries no doubt the upstream oil industry has allowed some opportunities for those individuals to move into the construction segment which is good but of course thats not in all geographic parts of the country the other thing that weve seen is that when we are on prevailing wage jobs which is a big chunk of our work we typically are able to get craft workers because the wage rates that we are providing those craft workers is higher than the open shop or nonprevailing wage work in the same geographic market i would suggest that there is an equal pressure point on talented professionals in the industry and when you start obtaining large work and you need   engineers different types of capabilities scheduling quality safety the technical side of the professional business i think is going to be actually reach a saturation point before the craft level does so there is a duplicate of concerns but as long as you are willing to reward those people properly i think those kind of companies are going to make it through this nice upward pick in the market but if you are going to stay on the cheap side youre going to have a problem obtaining and retaining people william bremer  maxim group llc okay and one last one if i could just tweak it in texas had quite a bit of rainfall midnovember to the end of the year was there any impact to the projects that you are doing there you are doing some material projects there james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well absolutely yeah we are doing some big work in dallas and it has affected – thats the ih job it has absolutely affected that job weve had a big – we had a big wet year at the beginning of last year as well that had a significant negative effect in texas then it dried out we made huge progress but i would say that that job – one job there in dallas itself has been affected by rain over the last  months william bremer  maxim group llc okay thank you jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director you bet operator the next questioner will come from sameer rathod of macquarie go ahead sir sameer rathod  macquarie capital usa inc hi good morning thank you for taking my questions i think in the past you guys have talked about a total sales funnel or total work outstanding that you guys see if i recall correctly it was like a  billion or  billion number how is that number tracking i know youve said  billion over the next year or so but how is the total amount of work that you are seeing coming to market changing james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well i would say sameer – by the way good to hear from you id say that its pretty similar to where its been it may be not even getting bigger the overall market size is growing and the question obviously is when we give you a  billion number those are things that are in our hopper that we are looking at and that we know are out there and that we are tracking and it could be two or three years down the road before that actually comes into play and there are also times where the owner decides to go a different route break the project up into smaller projects or they cant get the permits to actually build the work but i dont see that changing i actually see the amount of construction work growing thinking about the marketplace on construction thats the  million and less on the granite portfolio side i think that longterm outlook for work is actually growing quite a bit the other thing thats happening is that we are looking at a more diversified kind of pile of work out there in the us so we are not just looking at a big transportation project anymore we are looking at big power projects we are looking at big water facilities and as we expand our horizons and diversify i think that what youre going to see is that pot and we can talk about this in the future the size that overall longterm tracking is going to get bigger and bigger sameer rathod  macquarie capital usa inc right right thats helpful i guess my next question is on oil and gas obviously you dont have any direct exposure but youre in a stage that lot of the economy is based on oil and gas have you seen any kind of second or third order derivative from the decline in oil and gas on kind of how the public officials are thinking about infrastructure james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well i think that – yes and no i think certainly the oil sector and the crude pricing has caused some revenue issues in certain states and i mentioned in my remarks that the drop in crude and the board of equalization just dropped some significant gas tax requirements in the state of california and you think about a state that we do have a nice business in that has been hit with the – because of the oil industry – is alaska thats a very focused state on oil and energy and that has hit that state now weve done quite well up there and we anticipate doing quite well but certainly it puts struggles on states like that but its interesting in the power market were actually seeing our power business having tremendous opportunities by changing the transmission and distribution systems and looking at new power lines and decommissioning lines and expansion in rightaway projects and the construction management portion that we do so the oil and gas side and the related energy side except for the gas tax reduction in the state of alaska has actually helped our power business sameer rathod  macquarie capital usa inc right right okay thanks james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director all right thank you operator the next question comes from adam thalhimer of bbt go ahead adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets good morning congrats on a nice q james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah thanks adam laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets thinking about california for  how much of a headwind does the road budget for  james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well i wouldnt call it really a huge headwind i would call a lack of what i would want to see as a huge tailwind theres plenty of work in california the private sector is alive and well in california im just frustrated that california cant get – i call it  and get moving on a very proactive environment where we know that this work has to get done so california is one of our stronger states right now overall and the way that we are performing business the bottom line the revenue and everything else it just has another significant notch up that it can go when the politicians do what they are supposed to do adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets got it and then i think there was some hope early on with the fast act that it could lead to higher spring lettings is there still a chance of that i know you said that maybe the bidding was really too competitive james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think there is well no i think there will be spring lettings but remember what happens adam a spring letting lets just say typically youve got more states youve got a minimum requirement of  days to  days of public announcement to actually put a public bid out and then youve got somewhere between  days and  days to award the job typically inside the contract and then youve got another  days before the notice to proceed and you physically get out on the grade so thats why i was saying that i think well start seeing the positive effects of it late in the year but we absolutely can see some spring lettings but you still wont see the financial effects of that until later in the year adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets got it and then can you give any color – the large project margin was  last year maybe midteens next year i mean how should we think about it for  james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well what we mentioned there was that it should be somewhere in between we said that it should be better than last year but we dont see it at the midteens range in  weve got some early progression projects and again weve mentioned before that at the early part of our projects we hold some moneys back to try to make sure that the jobs are heading in the right direction and when the portfolio mix is still young you are going to naturally have a lower margin expectation so we mentioned  is when we start seeing getting back to the typical expectation  will be somewhat as a progression from where  was and in between  and  adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets but everything youve seen with those four mega jobs that you started late last year is encouraging to you or any change james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well they are very complicated jobs and complex inside and outside but all four of them are progressing quite well again only two of them are over the  mark and two of them are early in the stage just the i is very early in the stage and the pennsylvania job is in the first quartile of its stage so again we expect lower margins while they are in those early stages and the tappan zee is progressing quite well and it has had a very nice  weather certainly helped in  and the previous two winters did not help that job and i think i has progressed quite nicely in the second half of the year it got done with some serious range in the first half of the year and it is progressing well now as well but what happens is that when you get your new work now you start having to add on youve got the  which is a really nice win for granite you got the alabama i i job another nice win now youve got to mix those young ones back into the portfolio so i think that our projects are going well i think that you are going to see that were going to continue to increase the backlog and progression will be a combination of how well we execute and how well really we can get to work in some of those locations where weve got some significant winners new york so far is good pennsylvania is kind of come and go i know they got some weather hitting right now but overall i think our large project progression in  should improve from  adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets perfect thanks jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director all right thank you operator the next question comes from michael dudas of sterne agee go ahead sir michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc thanks for the followup cash flow pretty strong in the quarter looks like pretty good year laurel remind us about the debt repayment where thats headed and the followup jim given the outlook that youre presenting and you said in the past about potential acquisitions how do you feel about that today going into what looks like to be pretty good upturn next few years james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay why dont you hit the cash line first laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president sure so we have private placement notes that have five years of  million of payments and the first payment was due in december of  we refinanced our credit facility in the fourth quarter in october and as part of that we took a portion of it as a term loan and we used  million of that term loan to pay off some of the  million and then used cash for the remainder of it and so every year we will – and our plans for  are similar to what we did in  james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director right and then the other thing that happens with that new credit facility obviously larger than our old credit facility it ties nicely into the second question the ma side and we certainly are considering expanding the business through acquisition we are in the market to look and see whats out there we like and i mentioned it before diversifying geographically and in both end market diversifying into the water market i think is really top on our list geographically diversifying our vertically integrated business is top on our list and i think one of the things ive always said thats really important is that you do not move into the acquisition mode before you are efficient and effective in your core business at all times and im happy to say that i think our teams have done a tremendous job in  becoming more efficient more effective and our strategic plan is to grow both organically and through acquisitions michael s dudas  sterne agee  leach inc thanks jim and laurel james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director you bet laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks operator the next question comes from brian rafn morgan dempsey capital management go ahead sir brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc good morning jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning brian how you doing brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc doing good we talked about  billion that you were looking at bidding out how much of that is really highend design build james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director the majority of it brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc okay james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director i would suggest that when we start looking at large projects work now brian theres very few jobs remember our threshold is  million and most of the jobs today in this environment are way over  million and most of them are design build ill give you an example of one thats not thats actually bidding today is a job in hartford connecticut which is a somewhere between  million and  million tunnel job that is a bid build so different types of jobs are taking on different contractual outlooks tunnels are typically bid build the other projects were looking at are almost all design build nowadays all the big ones brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc okay when you do joint ventures youre talking about partnering is there a priority to being the general is there a benefit to being the lead or is it better to be just partner and diversify james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well okay so that is a very strong topic of discussion inside granite as well and its a very strategic question brian in fact its a really good question because theres a combination of things that you have to look at when youre – well call it yourself a sponsor or a nonsponsor on a joint venture and when you get into design build you have to make sure that if youre going to sponsor a job that you have the personnel to lead the job and that could be up to  or  people and i mentioned the engineering staff and those people that youre going to need to put on a project in order to be the lead player so you need to have those people available if youre going to lead a  billion job and be the sponsor the second thing that you need to be a sponsor is to make sure that you can handle the cash requirements of a large project a lot of these projects will start with a cash call and equity infusion and if youre going to be a  or  partner you need to do some very strong cash flow curves on these jobs to determine what kind of cash the company is willing to infuse in the job before you get a distribution now secondarily – so thats part one part two is a lot of times you can obligate yourself to a partner on the premise that if you are a nonsponsor or youre taking a smaller role today that you promise your partner youre going to take a larger role a year down the road and because it takes a lot of different requirements from the partners and sometimes theres not an even percentage of effort going into play you could be a  partner and put in  of the assets and the resources so you have to have sometimes sponsor sometimes nonsponsor i think youre going to see granite on jobs  million to  million and lower typically be the sponsor and i think that when we get to the larger jobs we would like to increase the size of projects that were sponsoring were healthy were developing a lot of people in the field today and i mentioned this earlier in roles so that they can actually run these  billion jobs going forward and when they become completed on the jobs theyre on and they become available into granite for future work i think youre going to see us bidding and sponsoring larger projects going down the road brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc okay i appreciate that on the aggregate side how much of the volume are you guys using internal versus external sales james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director its about  external  internal brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc okay okay all right and then you mentioned selectivity and you guys have always talked in the past about having discipline on bid day the types of – and i dont know if you can quantify it or give some color what are the types of projects that youve stayed away from are there geographic areas are there specific owners you dont have to obviously mention names but what are the types of things that through history that youve decided to avoid james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director its really important brian that is such a big deal especially in the large projects business and ill tell you what really surfaces in choosing and not choosing a job number one can you get the right team are you in the game early do you have the right partners and does that allow you an advantageous position on the project secondarily we look heavily at the contractual documents themselves how are they set up does this owner provide reasonable cash flow does this owner have a dispute resolution program that is fair are they the judge and jury with the dispute and also we look at the history of how weve done with these agencies across the country we dealt with the majority of these bigger agencies across the country and we know how they treat people the other thing we look at is when we go into a large job we go okay who are the competitors on this job and can we be competitive and if there is somebody that we know has an advantaged position over granite then we are not going to spend millions in bidding a job if we really dont think we have a great shot at getting the job so there is a host of issues that go into consideration and we actually have a complete committee in granite thats led by our coo and our head of our large projects group and we have – we look at risk mitigation through our risk department we have our legal department heavily involved in terms of how the contracts read we have our business development group in there to look at the partnerships with not only our joint venture partners but our engineering partners its a very comprehensive group that looks at all the opportunities and says okay this one you have a chance for obtaining the work and you have a really good chance at getting the margin that granite needs in order to come out to back end of the job brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc yeah okay i appreciate it and then several years ago during certainly the trough very difficult times you talked about more mobility with your crews shifting around expedite estimators as you guys build in capacity as you utilize capacity as you build up kind of getting back to more normalized margin structures is there less mobility because there is maybe less scarcity of business or are you still seeing more transfer and more mobility moving all over the country james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay so i think theres two parts to that question brian first of all i think in large projects there is always going to be mobility our people have to go to where those specialized large projects are and thats what our people sign up for and they know that and theyre very good at that now when you go to the construction business when you start seeing the local markets get healthier which they are then i think youre going to start seeing less mobility of those people because theyre going to be in a market where they look out in front of them and see five years  years of growth in the local market and they know that they can create significant value for the company staying in that local market the company is happy with it and we let them stay in those local markets so two parts to the question the smaller work is going to be less mobility required due to the strength of local markets today large projects will always have mobility brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc okay and then what – back to the old – yeah im going to go back to legacy so the old branch term business which you guys would kind of call construction today what is the constitution of that business are you seeing some private sector real estate is it industrial parks what – is it city and county highways what kind of is the bread and butter of kind of that rebuild of that business james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well you nailed it a lot of it it is the fact that the – what happens in those local markets and you put a geographic boundary around the local market brian and you say okay whats the health of the state and then you dial into whats the health of the county or the larger next jurisdiction and then whats the health of the local municipality whats going on in the private sector and residential residential by the way i would say is not something that is driving our business today but were snipping opportunities we are seeing developments starting and im going to say starting to be built again but the commercial market is very strong but what else weve done over the last five years is diversified into other parts of the business were doing a lot of work directly for the larger rail companies today we are working for water facilities today that we didnt do we are doing pipeline rehabilitation that we didnt do we are seeing the renewable energy business that we didnt do and the other thing that we have actually migrated into and most of it is  million or less is in the federal market weve actually gone to a whole new client weve got a nice couple of jobs bidding in guam are coming up in the next couple of months so weve diversified our portfolio and thats the strength of the construction business today that we didnt have five years ago brian brian gary rafn  morgan dempsey capital management llc right i got you hey thanks jim appreciate it james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay brian thank you operator and the final question for today comes from – pardon me the final question today comes from william bremer of maxim group go ahead william bremer  maxim group llc thank you gentlemen just update on capex of  and in particular what type of equipment and what are the lead times for that equipment have they increased at all james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director sure i think our capex is definitely going up weve been typically in the  to  of revenue range and well stay within that range but its sort of migrating towards the upper end as we start building new work the other thing that happens is and ill tell you one thing thats changed in our portfolio of capital expenditures is the tunneling industry so when we go out and sponsor a large project we now have to go out and buy these very very intricate tunnel boring machines that can be  million each now we typically get paid by the owner very quickly because they understand the cash requirements but that makes a very quick change in the overall volume of capital expenditures and those are quick turn items so thats not a big deal i will say this that weve done a complete kind of reboot of our capital expenditure program inside at granite and were ordering equipment now in the fall of the previous year for delivery in the spring and that was something that i commend our coo head of our equipment department and our local businesses are just planning better now and so you give a sixmonth led time but youve got to be that far in advance of the business william bremer  maxim group llc got you jim thank you james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay you bet there was another question though that i better address so what happens if trump gets elected do we have bridge building abilities i thought i heard that one in the background and weve got tremendous bridge building abilities and thats what we do so certainly we are ready for the next elected official to help build bridges and entire infrastructure in the us operator okay this ends our qa session for today i would now like to turn the call back over to our host james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay very good well

chief executive officer  director thank you ron and good morning everyone following another quarter of steady growth and solid performance i first want to congratulate granite teams across the country the focus on execution throughout our business is driving improved results across geographies and across end markets our constant focus on safety remains a steady contributor to our performance and i am quite proud of the fact that we again are riding this trend toward another year of record company safety performance another bright spot speaking of records our backlog at  billion once again moved the bar higher for us this quarter i am particularly proud of our results in the third quarter lukewarm public spending trends continue to be a key revenue influencer while revenue grew a little more than  quarterly gross profit improved more than  and net income more than doubled from last year strong performance was broad with profitability growing in each segment and margins continuing their steady upward trend in the third quarter we again were met by a consistent drumbeat of steady and competitive market conditions however without additional needed public funding we do not expect a significant change to the current competitive landscape before highlighting segment performance and turning the call over to laurel to discuss the financials let me spend just a couple of moments speaking about everyones most frustrating subject public funding trends lets start in texas where our large project headquarters is located and on a positive note texas voters tomorrow are expected to approve sjr better known as prop  which is expected to provide an additional  billion a year for txdot in an annual transfer from the texas general fund if approved it would represent the largest single increase in transportation funding in the history of the state importantly proposition  and last years texas ballot measure proposition  both require funding to be used for certain dedicated budget line items including rightofway acquisition construction maintenance and debt services and were getting more and more constructive about the coming opportunities here in our home state of california less than two weeks ago i had the opportunity to present to the california legislatures special session conference committee on transportation in two meetings the committee was presented with the governors  billion  enhancement plan as a potential starting point for discussion and negotiation the overarching need for investment has been evident to all during these earlystage discussions which notably have not been the base while the terms and timing of the ultimate commitment in california remain uncertain the vision for significant incremental dedicated transportation investment is coming into focus were hopeful that  can be a launch point for this critical investment and of course our quarterly discussion would not be the same without at least a mention of the latest inaction from washington dc just last week congress approved the th shortterm patch to transportation funding in the past six years extending funding three weeks through november  this sales strategy continues as we kick the proverbial can an ever shorter distance down an ever more crumbling road so while state and local level trends are encouraging it ultimately requires support from a longterm federal highway bill to free the growing wave of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of pentup demand across our country we still remain hopeful that congress will take responsibility on this critical issue and pass a longterm bill this year the latest shortterm extension only through november  is a positive sign that negotiations between the house and senate are getting closer to a final resolution we stand ready as a willing partner ready to grow and invest across our great country now lets get back to our performance in the third quarter first a look at the large project segment where results reflect improved steady performance on our earlystage portfolio after first half of the year marked by challenging weather and new projects that initially ramped up slower than we had anticipated we were able to build and recapture momentum in the quarter as revenue grew and gross margin reached doubledigits our project portfolio now has shifted considerably from recent years as larger and newer projects now comprise the majority of our work in the segment illustrating this point the majority of our large project segment revenue in the third quarter was from four megasize projects this include the new new york tappan zee bridge the ihe in texas the i ultimate in florida and the pennsylvania rapid bridge replacement of these projects only the tappan zee which has made solid progress in  has reached the halfway point of its project life as we have said for some time with our project portfolio weighted towards projects early in progression it produces margins that are lower in the initial stages of jobs than when the projects mature while we focus on execution of more than  billion of large project backlog we also are focused on successfully targeting teaming bidding and winning additional new work our large projects and federal groups recently teamed up to win a  million dam modification project in texas following project funding approval just last friday our tunnel division expects to receive notice to proceed later this week on a more than  million project in akron ohio these wins reflect a large project market that continues to show strength for granite looking ahead we have teaming agreements in place and expect to bid on more than  billion of large projects just between now and the end of  and in fact between now and the end of this year we expect to bid on  billion worth of projects these include the more than  billion purple line in maryland the grand parkway in houston at  million and in arizona the  billion loop  south mountain freeway in phoenix our percentage of participation in these projects remains in line with recent history building on the success we had in the first half of the year another key contributor of the third quarter performance was continued execution from our vertically integrated business once again our construction and construction materials segments delivered solid yearoveryear improvement the construction segment posted yearoveryear margin improvement for the sixth consecutive quarter with performance fueled by improvements across geographies and across end markets power and underground continued their strong performances in  helping drive segment margins north of  in the quarter both the public and private sectors are driving the steady improvement in local markets market and bidding environments remain fairly stable but quite competitive private and industrial market activity remains a focus of our growth and our diversification opportunities our teams are focused on improved pricing expectations and bidding discipline across geographies we continue to demand more value for our products and our services the consistent performance and improvement of our construction materials business was evident again in the third quarter once again internal and external demand drove revenue and profit growth the business is now operating at levels that we have not seen since the economic downturn with volumes in the quarter increasing doubledigits over  the result has been yeartodate margins at a multiyear high of more than  our highest level since  plant efficiency remains in focus and a highlight area for the business as operational and continuous improvement success at our materials facilities drives ongoing cost management gains of course while headlines hopefully will trumpet our next  billion project win soon it is equally as exciting for us to highlight the positive momentum in our vertically integrated business this momentum is very real as is the growing level of pentup demand and this represents an enormous growth opportunity for granite so with that i will turn the call over to laurel to discuss results and our  outlook laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you jim and good morning everyone third quarter  revenues were  million up  from last year earnings per share in the quarter more than doubled to  compared with  in  all segments contributed to thirdparty gross profit growth of  to nearly  million and total gross profit margin increased  basis points yearoveryear in the third quarter to  on a yeartodate basis gross profit of  million grew  which translated to  basis points of yearoveryear margin improvement to  at the end of q certainly were not where we want to be or need to be yet but we are making great progress as we continue our recovery from recent trough levels sga expenses increased  in the quarter but theyve risen just  yeartodate we continue to maintain and manage a strong balance sheet with more than  million in cash and marketable securities at quarter end total contract backlog at the end of the third quarter was  billion yet another alltime record up  from last year large project construction segment backlog increased  to more than  billion and construction segment backlog increased  yearoveryear to more than  million our runway build continues lets take a look at segment results third quarter construction segment revenues decreased  but we were particularly pleased with gross profit margin of  up  basis points from  last year strong execution across geographies and across endmarkets drove the profit growth with particular strength in certain parts of the west and across the kenny business lines large project segment revenues increased  in the third quarter and gross profit margin increased  basis points to  up from  last year this reflects a now complete yearoveryear transition from a portfolio weighted between mature and new products including a couple of challenging projects today our project portfolio remains heavily weighted toward newer larger projects still fairly early in progression and also today we progressed past most of last years mature projects and thankfully last years challenges are now largely behind us so while we expect midteens margins over the life of projects with four large and early stage jobs comprising the majority of our large projects revenue we continue to expect margins to remain lower in the earlier stages of these jobs than when the projects mature through the project lifecycle over the next few years and finally back to the growing bright spot in our construction materials segment where revenues increased  yearoveryear during the third quarter segment profitability increased at about the same pace producing gross profit margin of  in line with last year as strong volume trends drove revenue and profit growth before i touch on our guidance let me offer a quick update on two areas first an update on the yeartodate comparison of both initial profit recognition as well as that for claim recognition and claim recovery related to the change in our accounting policy this year as disclosed in our q which will be filed today on a yeartodate basis at the end of the third quarter of  initial profit recognition totaled  million a decrease from  million in the prior year period yeartodate claim recognition in  totaled  million compared to claim recovery of  million in the prior year period second as expected and subsequent to the close of the third quarter we completed a second amended and restated credit agreement the facility provides for an increase to  million from  million of which  million is a revolving credit facility and  million is a termloan with the revised maturity date of october  we intend to use a portion of the facility to pay down  million of initial principal payment on our higher cost senior notes in the fourth quarter of  while utilizing the remainder to help fuel our growth strategy and finally as we noted in our earnings press release this morning we did maintain the annual guidance we provided to you back in february we continue to expect midsingle digit consolidated revenue growth in  with ebitda margin in a range of  to  now before we take your questions let me turn the call back to jim james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thank you laurel allinall our solid third quarter and steady yeartodate performance reflects continued recovery from a more than six year industry slowdown across the country the construction industry has been sidelined by the lack of longterm dedicated federal transportation funding were already partner ready to build new capacity ready to repair our ageing infrastructure and ready to invest for future generations at granite we are building a stronger deeper organization with internal resources aligned to our operations to help us compete more effectively across end markets and across geographies we are poised for the next steps on our evolution well prepared to leverage our capabilities and to accelerate our companys growth and now well be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you very much the first question comes today from daniel scott with cowen  company please go ahead daniel scott  cowen  co llc hey good morning guys james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning dan laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning daniel scott  cowen  co llc you mentioned there at the end of the comments that obviously the major projects are early stages and lower margin other than tappan zee theyre all earlier in life and half way what year are we looking at for the existing portfolio of large projects where they will kind of hit their max profitability level for lack of a better term james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well i would say out of those four now again its going to depend on the new wins as well so on those four mega projects i would suggest to you next year well be in full stride on all four of them but remember as we continue to build new projects which we absolutely anticipate we will well hit on a few of these coming up it is going to really again weight the portfolio towards those four getting into the maturity stages and then some younger ones in the preliminary stages so it will continue to evolve dan over time but those four probably  and  theyll be hitting on all strides daniel scott  cowen  co llc okay great and then last quarter you made comments about aggregates pricing was encouraging and i think you said it was especially the higher quality products were showing the most strength is that trend continuing james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director it is in fact i would suggest that the higher quality products are becoming the higher demand products and that continues to really work directly into our material strategy as we try to make sure that we provide the higher quality products into the marketplace so yes its continuing and as noted in the financials and in some of laurels points there during her discussion the materials business is really strong right now daniel scott  cowen  co llc okay great thanks and then just one last thing in the past youve looked at potential to add i think some geographic diversity to aggregates as you try to move projects more into the east and also looked at water are you still thinking kind of those sort of potential growth areas through ma james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yes dan in fact i would just reinforce those are the two major areas of emphasis wed love to move our vertically integrated strategy eastward and we do like several end market diversification strategies one of which is water daniel scott  cowen  co llc okay great thanks so much guys james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thanks dan operator the next question comes from michael dudas with sterne agee michael s dudas  sterne agee crt good morning jim and laurel laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director hi mike michael s dudas  sterne agee crt dont want to – ill knock on wood here so if things maybe turn out more positively with new speaker house and senate getting together everybodys loving each other now in washington so they say can you take me through how this would evolve for the industry in general and how for granite particular how much time lag time how pentup are fittings can we see meaningful activity in  from this type of certainty i know its going to be very geographic and such related but maybe just share your observation on how that might occur for the industry and for granite james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay mike so maybe let me go back and give you my opinion of whats happening first and it hasnt changed actually in the last two quarters as we expected whether it is a boehner as speaker or ryan as speaker or whether it is inhofe or boxer heading up public work side of the senate were looking at end of the year bill coming into fruition and as we got these extensions over the last week from the house side moving and the senate moving to november  date for a highway bill thats a really good sign if you read and talk to a lot of the people that are in the know in dc youll hear a very strong level of optimism that they are working behind scenes to get something done and if you follow what happens in dc well if we get a bill out of the house and they get a bill which supposed to be the working on this week heavily and we go back to the july bill call it the back from the senate if we can get both of them to pass those bills then it goes to conference and what we are hearing today is that there is not a lot of work to get him to conference and what were hearing today is that the two bills that have been laid out so far are very similar in fact very very similar the senate bill has a little higher overall revenue base than the house bill but overall the terminology is very similar so they go into conference committee if they can get a bill done and lets call it by thanksgiving or pushing off even by christmas which im fairly confident of now i think it will infuse an attitude immediately into the system into the dots when they have an approach where they have certainty of their funding they will put work out to bid in advance of knowing that theyve actually got a longerterm bill out in front of them so i think  now well see the value of it in the back half because i think well see the projects coming out to bid in the first half of  and what well end up seeing mike is well see some of the work coming on to our books and the bottom line by the second half of  and then obviously continuing on from there michael s dudas  sterne agee crt very helpful jim my followup would be given tomorrow being election day i dont know if theres any initiative that you guys have on your screen throughout the us that might be helpful but maybe even talk about – maybe for  certainly with california you mentioned in your prepared remarks do you anticipate in a  election there will be a lot of those types of opportunities to kind of dovetail with some of this momentum you are seeing come out of washington james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director i do in fact let me go back and give you obviously the two big states that i mentioned real briefly in my remarks california it has been battling back and forth ever since the end of the regular session when they put together a special session starting in july and august and theyve been running all the way through november now trying to put together a longterm  billion shortfall mechanism in the state of california the special session i had the privilege of talking with them in front of them two weeks ago and theyre going to get something done in california thats fairly clear the question is going to be when and then if you look at whats going in california the governors proposal is a  billion year program with a shortfall of  billion so there are a host of legislators that believe that the  billion is not large enough which of course you can imagine mike i agree with them so that one is going to probably take a little time to work out because theyve got a host of mechanisms and this is whats happening in most of these states youre looking at potentially increased gas diesel taxes youre looking at increased licensing fees increased registration fees and in california in particular during the downturn there were monies that were taken from the potential highway transportation budget and maneuvered back into the general fund so they are trying to take money from the general fund and move it back to the transportation bill so those are all things that take time to work out and i think it will work itself out in california between the end of this year or maybe by the end of the first quarter and im firmly in belief that theyll get something accomplished so that it will start taking some traction by the end of next year now another big one that i mentioned briefly was sjr  better known as proposition  in texas now thats an interesting one because the way that one works and that goes to the polls tomorrow and strictly needs a majority vote in the state of texas and what that says is actually simpler what it says that if revenues exceed a certain amount in the texas budget then the overspill can go into transportation and their projections are that there will be excess revenue coming into the proposal so coming into the actual texas dot coffers so that one looks like a good chance of passing and looks like theres a really good chance of getting it funded based on texas revenue so those are the two big ones i havent followed a lot of the smaller ones recently we talked about in our last call mike that washington just passed a  billion program utah passed a really nice increase in their gas tax so all the states have really stepped up and now weve got the federal government just kind of needs to – its teed up they need to hit the home run michael s dudas  sterne agee crt jim thats quite encouraging thanks for your thoughts appreciate it james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thanks mike operator the next question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co good morning everyone laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning jerry jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co im wondering if you could just talk about whats the cadence of major large project awards on bids that youre involved with can you help us get a sense what the next couple of quarters should look like from an activity standpoint james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay maybe ask that again jerry you want to know which projects were bidding jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co so out of the projects that youre bidding and in your slide deck you typically have a list of  large projects that youre bidding im wondering if youd just talk about when those projects are expected to be awarded james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay very good so a couple of them that i mentioned in my discussions earlier weve got a large project bidding in arizona the loop  south mountain freeway that job just is turning in as we speak this week and that one will have an answer in january as to who will be the winner of that project and thats over  billion project the purple line light rail job in maryland weve been talking about this one for quite some time it goes in in december we will most likely hear about that sometime in late in the first quarter where that goes so that ones on the move fairly quickly what other one did i mentioned to you on there on houston the grand parkway job so that one – we should hear on that one where we end up in december so thats a nice one we also turned in the grand central caverns project in new york and we should hear about that any day as well so theres a host of big ones that we are turned in in the fourth quarter here that we should hear about several of them this year and then another couple of them early next year and then id be happy to walk through more bids if youd like to hear some more jerry jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co sure thatd be great jim any other major ones beyond that james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well a couple of ones our federal group is actually bidding quite a bit of work out in guam and thats really nice to see again theres a nice work for the navfac pacific the navfac marianas both guam jobs thats nice to see were bidding a very large project up at sound transit in seattle on the lynnwood link extension were looking at the next phase of the i job the southern gateway were bidding that in the first quarter of next year were actually bidding a large rail transit project in hawaii that weve been shortlisted on which is a very nice job its still listed down to three bidders and well be bidding that in the first quarter of next year and i can go on the list is endless jerry its just again like i said we got  billion of projects were bidding in the next  months  months to  months jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co and then laurel can you just talk about how we should think about operating leverage in construction materials your incremental margins this quarter were similar to absolute margins what drove that was there any allocation internal versus external and how should we think about operating leverage going forward laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so  of the material production has been external and as weve said we continue to work on efficiencies in our materials business we had a heavy cost base of fixed cost that we had to work now we have increased volumes and thats stopping directly to the bottom line so nice solid improvement in our construction materials business james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director the other thing jerry thats really important and laurel started alluding to it relative to our overall cost we have built up a very nice overall structure of equipment and plants across the western us and as those – as the materials market increases and the volume increases you certainly get efficiencies that we havent been able to see in a slower economic period so as we start increasing volumes a lot of our fixed costs are getting distributed over a larger volume and its creating higher margins for us as well so we are lowering our costs weve seen somewhere around a mid singledigit increase in pricing this year or we see more pricing increases coming for next year and we see the demand being quite steady and nice so really the materials business is getting back to where we know it can be and thats really the important part when you have a steady local economy that will drive the materials business and then if you can layer on a state transportation budget you can layer on a federal transportation highway bill those are really the icing on the cake with the materials business jerry david revich  goldman sachs  co okay thank you operator the next question comes from mike shlisky with seaport global securities michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc good morning guys laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning mike michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc can you just share with us i guess – so whats being talked about in a conference here in congress is this a bill that could come out or could get passed is this in line with what you were hoping for from a highway bill is it bigger or smaller than what you were thinking about maybe back when this whole thing first started many many years back james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay mike well let me be very candid and open with you upfront is that what i had hoped for absolutely not but probably what i had hoped for was never going to happen mike so lets be realistic but the key ingredient i think from the feds really is not the size of the program it is the longevity and the certainty that it provides longterm for the industry so from that perspective i am very happy that its a six year bill now one of the things that both the senate and the house have been focusing on is trying to figure out the funding mechanism for the back three years they both agreed so far in their individual bills that they will fund it for three years but theyve got to find more funding in the back half so i am fine with the overall value increase its an incremental increase on an annual basis over the six year period which is fine id like to see a little more tifia money in the finished product theyve got the tifia monies at about  million to  million with about a  multiple projection of what it puts into the overall transportation economy so down the middle thats about another  billion annually im fine with all the money part not what i hoped for but im actually fine with it because i think it creates value i think what we need to do now between now and ill say november  as we get into conference is we need to do a little more work on how were going to fund the back half of the overall bill michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc got it yeah got it and my follow up is im getting the sense that if a big bill like this is passed are there some companies out there that perhaps were prequalified here could start to ramp up and hire people to kind of get themselves prepared and perhaps broadly can you give us your overall thoughts on the state of obtaining and keeping labor on your team for the next lets say  months to  months james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay so labor is certainly a discussion but let me get into that in just a second so i dont think that that what happens in this industry is you cant be in and out of the industry one day out and then back in the next day so i dont see a highway bill changing the competitive landscape from adding a whole bunch of new players what i do see is there will be more competition for labor and fixed resources what will happen is that companies like granite weve got tremendous elasticity weve actually shrunk that portion of our business that i think will be affected by highway bill and that would specifically be our vertically integrated business they will be the largest beneficiaries of a highway bill and those – they have set labor forces in their markets and obviously were a major player in most of the markets we work in so i think its actually advantageous to people like us that have a strong presence already in the marketplace i think the industry as a whole mike the issue is going to be is do we enough labor force in the overall industry im very comfortable with the wage rates that granite pays and the relationships we have with our employees that will be able to increase our work force but i do think that you have to be in the market today to take advantage of the highway bill that were about to get michael david shlisky  seaport global securities llc great thanks guys i appreciate it operator the next question comes from adam thalhimer with bbt adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets hey good morning guys james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning adam laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets nice quarter in the construction segment you had a very strong margin in the quarter and you said that you had some contribution there from kenny im just curious whether is that a good run rate going forward or were there some unusual items in the quarter james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well lets do it this way again we dont talk about individual segments relative to run rates and guidance and all that but i will say this and im glad you brought it up the kenny business is progressing very very nicely obviously that was a very nice acquisition for granite they are a great team the two portions of the business that showed really strong encouragement in the third quarter was the underground business which is our rehabilitation and pipelining business and our power business which is very strong with the utilities and our relationship in the construction management role with a lot of these large utilities across the country i see that sustaining itself nicely over time and those both have very nice markets interestingly enough the two lines that i didnt discuss are progressing nicely in kenny as well were expanding our civil business in the midwest and we have some new young very talented management thats helping us to expand that business very nicely and then the other thing i didnt talk about was the power business its been a really good business for us we just got a new job in akron ohio and we see more opportunities out in front of us on the tunnel side so all in all the kenny business is performing at a very nice level and i dont think it is an anomaly one quarter at a time – one quarter anomaly relative to the margins but i again i would not want to provide any guidance relative to any of the individual segments adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets okay and then can you just provide a quick update on private construction in the west and also what youre seeing on housing in the west james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well lets start with the negative first housing i just have not seen housing really take off to any magnitude at all and it is not a really strong driver in our business right now and ive always said that when the residential market takes off again that will just be again more icing on the cake so to speak for granite and historically its been a nice driver of our materials business on the other side on a very positive side we are seeing very strong industrial very strong commercial both of those markets have heeded up nicely and we are migrating towards a larger percentage of private work relative to our overall portfolio than weve had in a long long time so the markets especially in the west and the commercial industrial markets are really progressing quite nicely adam robert thalhimer  bbt capital markets great okay thanks a lot james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thank you adam operator the next question comes from john rogers with da davidson please go ahead john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co hi good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning john john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co couple of just follow up in terms of the – just going back to the large project business and your comments jim about three of those four large projects that were driving business in the quarter not really hitting stride yet with the way you estimate margins for these projects can you just give us a sense of the range between the margins in the early stages and at the back half and still expectations that – i assume that this is a mid to highteens project business is that correct james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay yeah john i think that thats a good question i think let me state it to begin with that you know our business quite well and weve always said that our large project business is a midteen margin business and we continue to believe that that is the case and that is our expectation but what we end up doing when we bid and build our work we definitely hold back and im going to call it contingencies upfront there are a lot of unknowns once we start with this work and we create contingencies with milestones attached to them so that as we get more comfortable and confident as the progression of the job assuming we didnt run into an issue we release contingency as the job progresses now whats happening is about the way we have created most of our milestones is that they dont tend to get to the release point until probably youre halfway done and i think thats part of the issue when we talk about early progression we still hold some monies back just in case certain issues that we have predefined if they do come up and they occur then weve got money set aside for them so as i was mentioning earlier it depends on where the weighted portfolio is and in todays current book of business outside of tappan zee the other three mega projects are early in progression and still have contingencies setting aside for them to hopefully be released assuming we get past milestones and dont have issues in those milestones john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay and can you give us a sense of the orders of magnitude now between the swings it used to be zero at under  and then up over midteens in the remaining  i mean are you booking these projects at singledigit margins initially james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well again two ways to look at it the answer is no but we are booking them in the lowerteen range john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director and lower doubledigit range and then releasing contingencies as we move forward and the whole john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay i just wanted to get an order of magnitude james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah i would say – if you want to put it in the – its in the doubledigit ranges though we wont bid a job at singledigits or expect anything in the singledigit range doubledigits have always been there and then with the contingency on top of that that works ourselves towards the midteen range john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay and then laurel and i havent seen the q yet but you mentioned there were claims for the nine months of  million versus the recoveries last year can you tell us what those were in the quarter laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president the yearoveryear variance was about  million between profit recognition and claims john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay so  million in incremental cost in the quarter laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president right between claims and profit john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president no incremental revenue john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co oh incremental revenue sorry laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president right john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay thank you and then lastly its minor amounts but you havent had the significant asset sales that weve seen in the last couple of years and i know some of thats the excess property but your thoughts there i mean is the market not there or have you just got your equipment and your assets where you want them now james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director i think its a little bit of both john i think that we do have assets for sale and some sizable ones but at the same time some of them are very special assets and theyre going to take the right buyer at the right time and overall i think that the – when you look at the smaller assets which would be our equipment maintenance older equipment that markets been kind of stale and weve got no reason to dump our equipment at any cheap prices out into the marketplace so we just hold on to it we become opportunistic when the right opportunities come we actually sell them at that time the other thing to think about is we have tried not to sell a lot of our assets were pretty bullish on the fact that this overall highway program is going to increase and were going to need every asset we have to go build the work thats going to be coming out in front of us so we dont see a real strong desire to sell rolling stock certainly if we have some old land assets that are no longer useful those are the ones wed try to turn over john bergstrom rogers  da davidson  co okay great thanks a lot james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director thanks john operator the next question will come today from min cho with fbr capital markets min chung cho  fbr capital markets  co great thank you jim quick question just about international competition obviously its happening its inevitable in the larger projects but can you tell us if youre starting to see any impact on pricing on the projects that youre bidding on and if its impacting any win rates james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director that actually is a very interesting environment and we have seen increased competition from international companies and i think it has affected the prices theyre winning their share i will say this its not affecting what we think we need to get out of our work in large projects we continue to be very disciplined in the margin expectations that we have on large projects we have noticed that when we dont win a project and it is potentially an international competitor that does beat us some of the pricing can make you shake your head and question whether or not it is overly aggressive but thats somebody elses business and if they want to stay that aggressive in what i consider to be a high risk high reward business thats certainly their choice but for us were going to stay disciplined and keep our pricing where it is and the other thing i would suggest to you on these large large projects the majority of the win or lose will come out of the innovativeness of how you design how you build how you finance the work it typically is not based on the margin and we consistently look at whether we get a project or dont its based on how the project has come together with us working with our designers and our financers so i dont think margin is an issue but i have seen some international competition is bidding the work very cheap min chung cho  fbr capital markets  co okay and then laurel im assuming the folsom dam project was completed in the quarter were there any significant contingencies there that had an impact on large project margins laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president our q is going to be released today but the revisions and estimates arent significant net and yearoveryear so james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think that it was completed but its got some work were doing with the owner the corps of engineers to get it totally cleaned up the majority of the work is basically completed but it is not a significant player on the financials in the third quarter min chung cho  fbr capital markets  co okay great thank you operator ladies and gentlemen our final question today will come from nick coppola with thompson research group nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc hi good morning james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director good morning nick laurel j krzeminski  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning nick nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc so looking at the construction segment again apart from the industrial type work and private type work can you just talk more about public trends the competitive environment there whether its getting any better and whats happening with bid lists james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah so when you say public lets talk about the different kinds of public work certainly you have your dots which would be the majority of the largest public sector the other areas would be municipalities the cities the counties and i would say that the bid lists are stagnant id say in the five range to six range weve been talking about that for quite some time and i would say the pricing is just stable its the same as it has been i havent seen it get better and i havent seen it get a whole lot worse overall i think that as we get to a larger program i think thats when youre going to start seeing the pricing move but with the programs being diminished today some of the state programs just starting to kick in you get a federal highway bill that kicks in thats when im going to see probably the smaller bid list nick and the higher pricing opportunities but it hasnt happened yet so everything were doing is pretty much in a stable environment for the last  months nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc have you been seeing any regional highlights that are by state when you look across your offices james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director well we have and i really try not to dive into individual states but certainly ill give you one state that i think is healthier than it was four years or five years ago and thats california its done quite a bit better overall and i think its really the private sector thats driving it in california you look at the overall work were doing were building some major complexes for new office space were really heavily involved in the solar work were really doing a lot more private work in california so one of the bright spots out of all the states would be california and also were seeing some picked up activity in the other states around there as well but obviously california is one of our biggest state in the country nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc okay then my last question can you just talk a little bit more about what prop  would do for your business particularly how much incremental demand for larger projects could that drive james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director yeah okay so prop  the way i read prop  is that i dont think its going to have a huge effect on our business overnight for two reasons first of all in texas the work that we do there is mostly large projects nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc right james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director and those are focused on – ill call it quasimunicipal quasipublic agencies that have revenue streams that allow them to build these  billion jobs i dont see prop  affecting those large projects what i see prop  doing is increasing the daytoday smaller work in texas of which i would love to see granite have a larger role in the state of texas so between prop  and prop  i think what youre going to see is an enhanced local programs which will help us in the overall larger projects because we do compete with some local players in texas on the larger work so i think theyre going to probably be pretty darn happy with the local work and they may not migrate into the large projects but prop  i dont see the way its written today that its going to have a large play in large projects funding nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc okay understood thanks for taking my question james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay thanks operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes our qa portion of todays call so i would like to turn the call back over to our hosts james hildebrand roberts  president chief executive officer  director okay everyone thank you for your questions and thank you again to the granite employees for working hard working safely and living the granite core values every single day
