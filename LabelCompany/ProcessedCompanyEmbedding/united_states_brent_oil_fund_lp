anticipate estimate believe intend or project the negative of these words other variations on these words or comparable terminology these forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect and bno cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forwardlooking statements will come to pass bnos actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors bno has based the forwardlooking statements included in this quarterly report on form q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on form q and bno assumes no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements although bno undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that bno may make directly to them or through reports that bno in the future files with the us securities and exchange commission the sec including annual reports on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k introduction bno a delaware limited partnership is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca inc the nyse arca the investment objective of bno is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value nav to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of brent crude oil as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for brent crude oil traded on the ice futures exchange ice futures that is the near month contract to expire except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire the benchmark futures contract less bnos expenses near month contract means the next contract traded on the ice futures due to expire next month contract means the first contract traded on the ice futures due to expire after the near month contract it is not the intent of bno to be operated in a fashion such that the per share nav will equal in dollar terms the spot price of brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on brent crude oil it is not the intent of bno to be operated in a fashion such that its per share nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day the general partner of bno united states commodity funds llc uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in futures contracts as defined below and other crude oilrelated investments as defined below bno invests in futures contracts for crude oil dieselheating oil gasoline natural gas and other petroleumbased fuels that are traded on the ice futures the new york mercantile exchange the nymex or other us and foreign exchanges collectively futures contracts and other crude oilrelated investments such as cashsettled options on futures contracts forward contracts for crude oil cleared swap contracts and overthecounter transactions that are based on the price of crude oil and other petroleumbased fuels futures contracts and indices based on the foregoing collectively other crude oilrelated investments for convenience and unless otherwise specified futures contracts and other crude oilrelated investments collectively are referred to as crude oil interests in this quarterly report on form q bno seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of futures contracts and other crude oilrelated investments such that daily changes in its per share nav measured in percentage terms will closely track the daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract also measured in percentage terms uscf believes the daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of brent crude oil it is not the intent of bno to be operated in a fashion such that the per share nav will equal in dollar terms the spot price of brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on brent crude oil it is not the intent of bno to be operated in a fashion such that its per share nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in futures contracts and other crude oilrelated investments regulatory disclosure impact of accountability levels position limits and price fluctuation limits futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics most significantly the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the futures exchanges have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge which an investment by bno is not may hold own or control the net position is the difference between an individuals or firms open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity in addition most usbased futures exchanges such as the nymex limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts currently the ice futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by usbased futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation while some other nonus futures exchanges have not adopted such limits the accountability levels for the benchmark futures contract and other futures contracts traded on the nymex are not a fixed ceiling but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investors positions the current accountability level for any onemonth in the benchmark futures contract is  net contracts in addition the nymex imposes an accountability level for all months of  net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for oil if bno and the related public funds as defined below exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for oil the nymex and ice futures will monitor bnos and the related public funds exposure and may ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions investment and trading strategy and the extent of liquidity resources of bno and the related public funds if deemed necessary by the nymex andor ice futures bno could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net position back to the accountability level in contrast the position limits for the ice futures maintain that when  lots or more are traded the activity must be reported to the exchange on a daily basis ice futures also maintains that an expiration limit of  lots long or short will apply for the five business days up to and including the expiration date as of march   bno held  futures contracts traded on the ice futures europe and did not hold any futures contracts for brent crude oil traded on the nymex for the three months ended march   bno did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the ice futures and the nymex position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express cftc authority to do so in addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time the nymex and the ice futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire it is unlikely that bno will run up against such position limits because bnos investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract for the three months ended march   bno did not exceed any position limits imposed by the ice futures and the nymex the regulation of commodity interest trading in the united states and other countries is an evolving area of the law as exemplified by the various discussions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the cftc the national futures association the nfa the futures exchanges clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies futures contracts and position limits the cftc is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on nonus futures exchanges and markets the cftc however has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of nonus futures contracts in the united states these regulations permit certain contracts on nonus exchanges to be offered and sold in the united states on november   the cftc proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in  physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture energy and metals markets the position limit rules on the same date the cftc proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control the proposed aggregation requirements specifically the position limit rules would among other things identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month individual month and all months combined create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions impose responsibilities on designated contract markets dcms and swap execution facilities sefs to establish position limits or in some cases position accountability rules and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues overthecounter otc dcms sefs as well as nonus located platforms until such time as the position limit rules are adopted the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the position limit rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives collectively referenced contracts under that system the cftc enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products eg corn wheat and soy while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products eg oil and natural gas as a result bno may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits finally subject to certain narrow exceptions the position limit rules require the aggregation for purposes of the position limits of all positions in the  referenced contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates regardless of whether such position existed on us futures exchanges nonus futures exchanges in cleared swaps or in overthecounter swaps under the cftcs existing position limits requirements and the position limit rules a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a  percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding at this time it is unclear how the proposed aggregation requirements may affect bno but it may be substantial and adverse by way of example the proposed aggregation requirements in combination with the position limit rules may negatively impact the ability of bno to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit uscfs ability to sell additional creation baskets of bno see commodity interest markets  regulation in this quarterly report on form q for additional information based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations uscf does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of bno to achieve its investment objective swap transactions the doddfrank act imposes regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that bno is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of bno to meet its investment objective on august   the cftc and the sec published joint final rules defining the terms swap and securitybased swap the term swap is broadly defined to include various types of overthecounter derivatives including swaps and options the effective date of these final rules was october   the doddfrank act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations or derivative clearing organizations dcos if the cftc mandates the central clearing of a particular contract on november   the cftc issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered dcos this is the cftcs first clearing determination under the doddfrank act and became effective on february   beginning on march   swap dealers major swap participants and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps and beginning on june   commodity pools certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps as a result if bno enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after june   such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future and when finalized could require bno to centrally clear certain overthecounter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bilateral basis if a swap is required to be cleared the initial margin will be set by the clearing organizations subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the cftc the sec or the applicable prudential regulator the doddfrank act also requires that certain swaps determined to be available to trade on a sef must be executed over such a facility on june   the cftc published a final rule regarding the obligations of sefs including the obligation for facilities offering multiple person execution services to register as a sef by october   based upon applications filed by several sefs with the cftc the cftc has determined that certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps are available to trade on sefs and beginning on february   certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps must be executed on a sef on november   the cftcs division of clearing and risk division of market oversight and division of swap dealer and intermediary oversight published guidance with respect to the application of certain cftc rules on sefs that guidance clarified that sefs could not restrict access to participants who are permitted to trade swaps and that sefs may not require participants to have breakage agreements in place with other counterparties on april   the cftc published a final rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement the rule permits affiliated counterparties to elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement if among other things the counterparties are majorityowned affiliates whose financial statements are included in the same consolidated financial statements and whose swaps are documented and subject to a centralized risk management program however the exemption does not apply to swaps entered into by affiliated counterparties with unaffiliated counterparties on november   the cftc published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants fcms the rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner on april   the cftcs division of clearing and risk issued a letter granting noaction relief from certain swap data reporting requirements for swaps entered into between affiliated counterparties in general the letter grants relief from among others realtime historical and regular swap reporting under part  part  and part  of the cftcs regulations respectively on november   the cftc published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin guarantee or secure uncleared swaps in other words the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by bno in connection with uncleared swaps in addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the doddfrank act swap dealers that are european banks may also be subject to european market infrastructure regulation emir these regulations have not yet been fully implemented general regulation applicable to bno on august   the cftc issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators cpos of investment companies registered under the investment company act of  the investment company act that are required to register due to recent changes to cftc regulation as the regulatory requirements are constantly evolving it is difficult to predict the effect any regulatory changes may have on bno price movements brent crude oil futures prices exhibited moderate daily swings along with a downward trend during the three months ended march   the price of the benchmark futures contract started the period at  per barrel the benchmark futures contract reached its high for the period on march   at  per barrel and reached its low for the period on february   when the price dropped to  per barrel the period ended with the benchmark futures contract at  per barrel down approximately  over the period bnos per share nav began the period at  and ended the period at  on march   a decrease of approximately  over the period bnos per share nav reached its high for the period on march   at  and reached its low for the period on january   at  the benchmark futures contract prices listed above began with the february  contract and ended with the may  contract the decrease of approximately  on the benchmark futures contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding futures contracts an investment in futures contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result furthermore the change in the nominal price of these differing crude oil futures contracts measured from the start of the period to the end of the period does not represent the actual benchmark results that bno seeks to track which are more fully described below in the section titled tracking bnos benchmark historically the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in  in recent years us crude oil markets experienced long periods of contango while brent crude oil moved into a state of backwardation in  during the three months ended march   us based west texas intermediate wti crude oil and brent crude were predominantly in backwardation contango means that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract was below the price of the next month crude oil futures contract or contracts further away from expiration backwardation means that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract was above the price of the next month crude oil futures contract or contracts further away from expiration for a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns see term structure of crude oil prices and the impact on total returns below valuation of futures contracts and the computation of the per share nav the per share nav of bnos shares is calculated once each nyse arca trading day the per share nav for a particular trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time bnos administrator uses the ice futures settlement price a weighted average price of trades during a three minute settlement period from  pm to  for the contracts held on the ice futures but calculates or determines the value of all other bno investments including nymex contracts or other futures contracts as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time results of operations and the crude oil market results of operations on june   bno listed its shares on the nyse arca
