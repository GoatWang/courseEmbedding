operating results funds from operations ffo is a widelyrecognized nongaap financial measure for reits that the company believes when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with gaap provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance ffo is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of reits most of which present ffo along with net income as calculated in accordance with gaap the company computes ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders determined in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring sales of depreciable property and impairments plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures however ffo � does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which unlike ffo generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and � should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance ffo as defined by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other reits due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance relating to business combinations which among other things requires any acquirer of a business investment property to expense all acquisition costs related to the acquisition the amount of which will vary based on each specific acquisition and the volume of acquisitions accordingly the costs of completed acquisitions will reduce our ffo acquisition costs for the three months ended june   and  were approximately  and  respectively acquisition costs for the six months ended june   and  were approximately  and  respectively the table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with gaap to ffo for the three and six months ended june   and   for the three months ended for the six months ended june   june   june   june   net income for period         plus real property depreciation     amortization of tenant improvements and allowances     amortization of deferred leasing costs     depreciation and amortization attributable to unconsolidated joint ventures     loss from discontinued operations     funds from operations         results of operations at june   the company had equity interests in  properties of which  are consolidated consolidated properties in the accompanying financial statements and one is accounted for under the equity method of accounting the company believes because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas the nature of its investment provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times the company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt the company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy property operating income is a nongaap financial measure of performance the company defines property operating income as operating revenues base rent and recoveries from tenants less property and related expenses property operating expenses and property taxes property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses mortgage interest income depreciation and amortization acquisition transaction costs interest expense gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures extraordinary items tenant improvements and leasing commissions other reits may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income and accordingly the companys property operating income may not be comparable to other reits property operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the companys properties to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the companys properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties the company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the companys properties as well as trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs property operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the companys properties but does not measure the companys performance as a whole property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with gaap results of operations for the three months ended

the consolidated financial statements this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the companys accounting policies included in note  to roics and the operating partnerships consolidated financial statements  revenue recognition the company records base rents on a straightline basis over the term of each lease the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant and other receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a prorata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the companys best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected in addition the company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straightline rent receivable allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts the analysis places particular emphasis on pastdue accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables the payment history of the tenants or other debtors the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and managements assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations among other things managements estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants particularly those at retail properties estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance real estate tax and insurance costs the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual writeoffs based on its analysis the company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items in addition the company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straightline rent receivable real estate land buildings property improvements furniturefixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as

excludes general and administrative expenses mortgage interest income depreciation and amortization acquisition transaction costs other expense interest expense gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures extraordinary items tenant improvements and leasing commissions other reits may use different methodologies for

compare the operating performance of the companys properties to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the companys properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties the company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and

of the companys properties but does not measure the companys performance as a whole property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance
