transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of gmf would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to americredit automobile receivables trust  to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses this shows a potential downgrade of two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings below bsf or possibly default under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario use of thirdparty due diligence
