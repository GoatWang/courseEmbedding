times staff writer its founder made a fortune selling picks and shovels to the ers who came to california in search of gold one hundredforty years later the los angeles company that bears his name has lost more money than charles l ducommun ever dreamed ofduring the past five years troubled ducommun inc has sold off its metals and electronics operations to raise badly needed cash the moneylosing aerospace business that remains has been plagued with cost overruns bloated inventories and production problemsthe company has lost money for four straight yearsa total of  million since the beginning of  the situation is so grave that alan n ducommun the founders yearold grandson gives californias oldest company only a  chance of survival its pretty damn sick he saidwhether the firm prospers depends a good deal on norman a barkeley a onetime chairman of lear siegler corp who became ducommuns chairman in january former lear siegler colleagues say the yearold barkeley knows the aerospace business and is a good salesman but they find it hard to evaluate his skills as a chief executivebarkeley had been lear sieglers boss for only four months when the santa monicabased company was sold to forstmann little  co a new york investment firm in december  after a bidding war involving a number of different playersi really dont know what he is like running a company said james n thayer lear sieglers former chief financial officer we were fighting a bunch of corporate raiders and all that external stuff there wasnt enough time for him to run the companythough barkeley held important jobs during his  years at lear siegler most decisions of any consequence were made by the companys longtime chairman robert t campion bob campion was a very strong guy said thayer now chief executive of gibraltar financial he ran the companyeven so newsouth capital management inc a memphis tennbased pension fund management firm that owns about  of ducommun thinks that barkeley may be the right man for the job hes experienced in aerospace and is a handson manager not a financial gymnast said charles slatery a portfolio manager for newsouth barkeley wants to revive the company if thats possible slatery added hell sell it if it cant be turned aroundquiet hardworkingbarkeley is said to be quiet reflective and hardworking often starting hour days at  am he refused to comment for this story saying through a spokeswoman that there was nothing new to say about ducommunbarkeley was introduced to ducommun by director thomas p mullaney a beverly hills investment banker who had also been a lear siegler director we put him on the board to see if we could work with him said robert c ducommun  a director and greatgrandson of the companys founder if we all felt comfortable with him we decided that we would bring him in as ceobarkeley joined the board in  about the time he left lear siegler he became ducommuns president and chief executive last julyrobert ducommun has nothing but praise for barkeley who has transformed ducommuns upper management into something of a lear siegler alumni club he has hired lear sieglers former treasurer its human resources director and its auditor the new head of ducommuns troubled aerospace company jayel products is also an exlear siegler executiveat the same time barkeley has reduced the companys work force by  to  employees since last summeri think very highly of him and his team robert ducommun said he has completely rebuilt the middle management of the company and has everyone thinking in terms of how we can become profitablehe is trying to be a hero said alan ducommun who retired from the board last december he said barkeley might be able to keep the company going if the banks stay with him the company is negotiating a new loan agreement with its banker security pacific ducommuns million revolving credit line is secured by all its assets and expires on june  according to loan documentsinvestment analysts say barkeley will no doubt try to refinance the  million in convertible debt on the companys books the debt is a heavy burden to the company and because it is convertible into stock has severely eroded the ducommun familys ownership stake in the company in fact three large bondholders control more than  of the company according to its  proxy statement while the familys position is just lost a fortunethe
