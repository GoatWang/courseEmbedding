because each fund pursues its own unique investment objectives each fund has its own set of risks which are fully discussed in its prospectus in order to achieve their investment objectives some funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps these instruments involve risks different from and in certain cases greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments for funds that can invest in foreign securities which may include emerging markets securities risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios funds that invest in smallcap and midcap stocks are often more volatile than largecap stocks—smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines markets and financial resources funds that invest in real estate are subject to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market such as economic conditions mortgage rates and availability which can cause the value of such investments to decline reits may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to decreasing bond prices as interest rates rise and increasing bond prices as interest rates fall the values of mortgage related securities and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk in addition a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline funds that invest in debt securities issued by state or local governments may be subject to special political legal economic and market factors that can have a significant effect on the portfolio’s yield or value lipper rankings are based on total returns at net asset value without the imposition of a sales charge which would reduce total return figures lipper averages represent the average returns of funds contained in the lipper universe funds in the lipper
