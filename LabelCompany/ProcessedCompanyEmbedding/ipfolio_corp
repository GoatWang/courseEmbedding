administrative assistant jm huber corporation atlanta ga usa in the past we used traditional docketing programs that are not only very expensive but are created with law firms in mind they are not geared for companies who use outside counsel to prosecute their ip but who still wishes to keep up with their portfolio from a business inhouse counsel perspective when we learned about ipfolio we were excited to finally be able to increase our functionality and decrease our cost by switching we still had our reservations about migrating from one system to another anyone who has gone through this knows what a nightmare it can be but surprisingly even the data transfer was painless and the transition smooth with ipfolio we are able to run sophisticated reports with a simple click and drag we use it to help us conduct portfolio meetings follow product development keep sight of our domestic and foreign filings track our ip expenses and manage ip contracts the system is very flexible and

inghild rossmolnes ip services manager subsea  london uk a year and a half ago the excel spreadsheet i used to manage our company’s patent portfolio was about to collaps  pages with many many tabs it was no longer an option together with our external patent attorney i started looking for an external online tool which could make my work easier and the day to day management and administration of the portfolio so that it was easily available to the ip team but also where our external patent attorneys could also work on the same tool as my team is spread between three different locations in the world it was important to find something that was immediately updated easy to use and which provided us with the “assistance” we needed we reviewed several different available online ip tools but after the presentation of ipfolio we knew what we wanted it took a while to get everything set up exactly the way we wanted it but ipfolio helped us the whole way and even programmed some extra tools

to replace a very effective but aging system of homegrown spreadsheets that we had been using for nearly four years to manage our ip portfolio the secondbiggest challenge has been adaptation of the base ipfolio product to incorporate the desired operational and reporting functionality that we had spent years building in our prior system here geniusatlarge kevin nugent has done an extraordinary job of both establishing that baselevel functionality as well as being available often on very short notice to assist in onthejob training for me the number one biggest challenge however has been the integration of years worth of parallel data that existed at our outside patent counsel’s firm in this case kevin teamed with heather fleener to migrate that data into ipfolio then work thru a very tedious datacompare heather’s ipfolio expertise combined with very strong ip operational experience has ensured total success with very little downtime for me” ipfolio corporation  company profile
