not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  it is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity we define “adjusted ebitda” as net income loss before interest expense net of interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties noncapitalized subscriber acquisition costs stock based compensation the historical results of our solar variable interest entity and certain unusual noncash nonrecurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers because not all issuers and analysts calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information about flexibility under our covenants to investors lenders financial analysts and rating agencies since these groups have historically used ebitdarelated measures in our industry along with other measures to estimate the value of a company to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate a company’s ability to meet its debt service requirements adjusted ebitda eliminates the effect of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets much of which results from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting adjusted ebitda also eliminates the effects of interest rates and changes in capitalization which management believes may not necessarily be indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance adjusted ebitda is also used by us to measure covenant compliance under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility see the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in

growth smart home adoption and an increasing rmr we did have a slight rise in the twelvemonth attrition rate during the first quarter however we believe this is primarily due to the  month contracts

financial measures this earnings release includes adjusted ebitda which is a supplemental measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure that is not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states it is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity we define “adjusted ebitda” as net income loss before interest expense net of interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties noncapitalized subscriber acquisition costs stock based compensation the historical results of our solar variable interest entity and certain unusual noncash nonrecurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers because not all issuers and analysts calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information about flexibility under our covenants to investors lenders financial analysts and rating agencies since these groups have historically used ebitdarelated measures in our industry along with other measures to estimate the value of a company to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate a company’s ability to meet its debt service requirements adjusted ebitda eliminates the effect of noncash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets much of which results from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting adjusted ebitda also eliminates the effects of interest rates and changes in capitalization which management believes may not necessarily be indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance adjusted ebitda is also used by us to measure covenant compliance under the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes the indenture governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility   see the tables below for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap apx group holdings inc and subsidiaries reconciliation of nongaap financial measures  amounts in millions unaudited    i      excludes loan amortization costs that are included in interest expense ii      reflects subscriber acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred because they are not directly related to the acquisition of specific subscribers certain other industry participants purchase subscribers through subscriber contract purchases and as a result may capitalize the full cost to purchase these subscriber contracts as compared to our organic generation of new subscribers which requires us to expense a portion of our subscriber acquisition costs under gaap iii     reflects noncash compensation costs related to employee and director stock and stock option plans iv     nonrecurring gain on the gig sale v      bonuses and transaction related costs associated with the gig sale vi    other adjustments including certain items such as product development costs fire related expenses subcontracted monitoring fee savings and other similar
