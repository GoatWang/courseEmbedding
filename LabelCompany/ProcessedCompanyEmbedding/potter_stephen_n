investments ntgi with  billion in assets under management emphasizes a quantitative approach to money management with over  billion of assets under management focused on the quant space its investment strategies include using an array of internally managed products and multiple manager solutions to expose clients to wellresearched work by boutique “alpha generators” at the same time ntgi is widening the crossborder aspect of its investment approach portraying itself more as a global company that “just happens to be headquartered in chicago” rather than a chicagobased firm that invests worldwide global investment technology spoke with stephen n potter who recently took over the helm as president of northern trust global investments git what are some of the key trends shaping the asset management business worldwide which as yet are not widely noticed sp markets are difficult and the liabilities for pension funds and demands for countries to be able to maintain or develop wealth are key drivers of change we see risk avoidance being a key part of the business and therefore a series of strategies are unfolding we see pension funds being sold into new entities that are financed solely for that purpose we see pension funds merging with one another in the netherlands and we see a trend toward liability driven investment in the netherlands several large established pension funds are converting into commercial enterprises either by leveraging their core competencies or buying other pension funds to gain scale essentially turning themselves into multimanager pension factories this really says that the way we operated in the past is not the way we will operate in the future i can’t predict if any of these will truly be successful in the long run but they all represent dynamic change at an accelerated pace git how has the pace of technological change changed money management sp risks and obligations in the pensions market and the acceleration of capital development and wealth creation have changed the way markets operate investors’ needs have changed the opportunity to invest has been somewhat constrained by supply and expected returns of traditional markets we have seen a very strong movement toward alternative asset classes including commodities and infrastructuretype products there’s a need to gain absolute return not just trundle along with the benchmarks of traditional equity indices for example the opportunity set has to broaden and value creation needs to be looked at both in the assets that are invested and the asset allocation but also the positions that are taken whether long or short fundamentally the dramatic change in this universe all goes back to research by gary brinson and others on asset allocation wellconstructed investment programs and the ability to control and monitor risks the programs that have been successful have those common elements more simply just having a good idea of your investment objective allows you to construct portfolios that clearly achieve that objective or can be measured and recorrected when they need to be git what are your biggest challenges and opportunities as president of a leading global asset management firm sp making sure i stay focused on areas where we excel such as quantitative management we’re excellent at shortduration fixedincome and we’re excellent at multimanager solutions we will continue to invest significant resources in those they are the building blocks of the solutions that our clients seek in their investment programs so again it’s about focus and truly being a market leader in areas where we seek to compete on the other hand it’s very powerful to create product solutions with a broad platform with the kind of integrity trust and reputation that northern trust has so i expect to continue to support the buildout of our investment businesses off that strong foundation and increasingly stronger global franchise our delivery of product and achieving our clients’ objectives does require incredible focus as we know even with the best of focus sometimes the markets can take us into some unusual places git can you comment on your business priorities for  sp first and foremost is execution and ensuring that we’re excellent at the areas we are addressing when we aren’t excellent we’ll seek to remedy that beyond that we have a clear strategy around multimanager quant and shortduration fixedincome i want to ensure that those products are wellreceived and continue to be positioned the right way in the marketplace as part of that we will enhance our position in alternative assets we have a very good capability for hedge fund of funds and private equity products but i would like those to be of greater scale i’d like them to have broader market applicability into other jurisdictions that suggests a build or a buy in that space the other area which ties into our existing relationship orientation and platform is building more quantitativerelated products such as enhanced quant products even though current markets have not been favorable for those strategies i believe there is a very important place for them also building additional structured products could create more customized solutions for wealth management or large additional institutional investors git what has been the impact of the us subprime loans crisis on enhanced money market funds that invest in assetbacked securities sp there is a clear mismatch between current valuation and what someone can actually trade at if they can trade at all and what the models would have told us those assets were worth this is part of an inevitable cycle of product and market dissonance this is a correction period for those who are left holding these assets they have a challenge ensuring that they have proper valuations and proper governance of their funds and can therefore assure their investors that in the long run those products will return to where the models said they were many market participants have a bigger problem because of marktomarket rules it’s a dynamic problem for the banks and fund managers that have significant fixed income holdings fortunately northern trust’s longterm conservative philosophy has let us work through this from a position of strength we own some assetbacked securities but they are a small percentage of our total and much less so than our competitors git what are some of the risk management challenges that have been flagged for which it solutions need to be overhauled or reengineered sp assetbacked securities that were marked to model as opposed to marked to market present a challenge the lesson there is unless something really trades it’s pretty hard to know what it’s truly valued at no matter what the model says so that’s a philosophical question rather than a technology question but it does instruct us in how we look at the assets that we put into client portfolios or onto our own balance sheet as a bank we’ve always been skeptical of anything that we can’t really feel touch and understand and we have a little more conservative approach technology is valuable to properly construct portfolios and manage risk — it hasn’t failed us or the industry — but some take too much comfort in valueatrisk and other risk management methodologies and the numbers those systems produce market participants may have become too comfortable given the growth happening at that time or incentives were improperly established so i don’t blame technology but hubris and a lack of attention to classic risk management discipline investing based on momentum and fads often leads to this sort of correction git what prevents specialized asset managers from executing strategies that work in one market for them and their clients in another market sp the local subcustody market for us is uneven in the quality that we seek in market settlement and information flows that’s part of the problem but the other side of it is the availability of quality equities and supply in those markets especially in the hot emerging markets to keep up with demand in some strategies we may want to have more supply and more opportunity to go into a market but suddenly because of supply it’s constrained and therefore you can’t get the right value points in your investment strategy what might work in the larger floattype market doesn’t work in the smaller emerging markets git are custodians meeting the needs of asset managers in an increasingly complex investment arena how much does northern trust outsource compared to what it keeps inhouse sp i broadly define asset servicing as including fund administration middle office and backoffice outsourcing through outsourcing arrangements with insight investment management julius baer and several other notable fund managers we actually have become the back office and middle office of four top fund managers we work with them to move products into new markets and create new wrappers in the past when northern trust global investments launched new products we used quality thirdparty providers but often given the strategies we then build our own asset services support for example we now are doing our own hedge fund administration and private equity administration we will build our own exchangetraded funds operations over time and are well positioned in that space git five years from now where do you see the asset management business and where do you see ntgi sp for a wellrun business in these markets the objective is to double every five years so i envision being at  trillion in assets under management in five years with a strong focus on short duration quant and multimanager the beauty of these products is that they are perpetually in demand and they are flexible platforms that support growth they can morph with the changing demands of investors with different indices and different domiciles both the quant business and the multimanager business are easily adaptable we’re increasingly global in outlook and more sophisticated in our portfolio
