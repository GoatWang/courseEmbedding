microbiological and viral contamination viruses are detected using polymerase chain reaction which is a method that can detect as little as one copy of the virus in a sample by amplifying a short sequence of the viral dnadna deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup or rnarna ribonucleic acid in some viruses performs the role of dna to create many copies please refer to our product processing flow diagram for a summary of the processing view diagram is prolacta regulated by any federal or state agencies yes prolacta products are regulated by the fda prolacta’s facility is licensed as a tissue bank by the states of california new york and maryland which require such a license for human milk banking how are breast milk donors screened prior to donating milk breast milk donations follow a rigorous screening process based on the blood banking model prolacta is the only organization that uses these combined safety steps potential breast milk donors are screened through a medical history survey after the screening the donor is entered into prolacta’s secure database and assigned a donor number once the potential donor passes the medical history survey she must obtain written approval from her physician and her baby’s pediatrician before she can continue in the donation process the potential donor measures the temperature in her freezer with a thermometer provided by prolacta the temperature must be cold enough to store human milk or unfortunately the potential donor may not donate a blood test and a dnadna deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup cheek swab are conducted the blood test screens for several infectious agents including hivhiv human immunodeficiency virus is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids  htlvhtlv human t lymphotropic virus is a retrovirus that causes some forms of lymphoma and is in the same

chronic illness that can lead to liver failure or liver cancer hcvhcv the hepatitis c virus is a cause of hepatitis a liver disease hcv infection sometimes results in an acute illness but most often becomes a chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer and syphilis the dnadna deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup cheek swab is used to create a donor dnadna deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup id this dnadna deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup id will be used later to ensure the milk received is from the donor that was blood tested if the potential donor passes the screening and meets all of the requirements outlined above she is qualified to be a breast milk donor for a four month period after four months if she wishes to continue donating she must complete a new medical history survey and have another blood test why is prolacta no longer copromoting products with abbott effective jan   abbott and prolacta bioscience will no longer copromote prolacta products when we first began copromoting prolacta products both companies had relatively small product portfolios for premature babies over the years both of our businesses have grown and we both now have extensive portfolios of products to provide the best service to our customers both companies decided it was best to focus on supporting their respective portfolios why should i donate if you have excess breast milk you can donate it to be processed into specialty formulations and sold to hospitals to help meet the nutritional needs of critically ill premature infants in neonatal intensive care units many moms donate their extra milk to help babies in need because they have had a preterm baby in the past or know someone who has had that experience breast milk donors report a sense of satisfaction knowing they are providing their milk to help provide the added nutritional needs to sick premature infants why do you conduct dna testing on donors the dna matching step is necessary so that the milk we receive is matched to our qualified donors this safety step ensures that only milk from qualified moms is accepted for production we start by having the prospective donor provide a sample of cheek cells that we can use to create a unique donor id we extract the dna from the cheek cells and use it to create a series of  numbers that are unique to that donor only identical twins share the same profile two of the numbers in the profile tell us whether the dna comes from a man or a woman once the donors milk arrives we take a sample of the dna found in the milk and generate a milk id we then look to make sure that the donor id and milk id profiles match we can also see if there are multiple milk id profiles in the same donation indicating there are two or more different mothers’ milk is contained in the donation the only information that we generate about the donor from her dna are the donor and milk ids we do not generate any other genetic information about the donor the donor id contains no information about the donor’s health or heredity prolacta does not retain samples of the donor’s isolated dna once the matching of donor to donation is complete the only thing that is retained is the  number donor id while there are other ways to match a donor to a tissue sample this technique is considered the most accurate and is the gold standard follow us return
