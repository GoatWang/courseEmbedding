management publications related links contact us product candidates separate product lines we have developed several different product lines based on the dcvax technology to address multiple different cancers and different patient situations there are two main components to each dcvax product the immune cells dendritic cells and the cancer biomarkers antigens all of our dcvax product lines are made from the patient’s own dendritic cells the dendritic cells are freshly isolated and newly matured and activated we believe that the existing dendritic cells in a cancer patient have already been compromised by the cancer and we believe that is the reason other vaccines aimed at the existing dendritic cells in patients have largely failed however the patient’s body continues to produce new precursors of dendritic cells and these precursors called “monocytes” circulate in the patient’s blood stream for all dcvax products these precursors are obtained through a blood draw and then through our proprietary manufacturing processes the precursors are matured into a fresh uncompromised batch of new dendritic cells the biomarker targets “antigens” component of the dcvax product which is combined with the fresh personalized dendritic cells varies among the dcvax product lines dcvaxl dcvaxl — is made with cancer antigens from tumor lysate a protein extract from processed tumor cells from the patient’s own tumor tissue as such dcvaxl incorporates the full set of tumor antigens making it difficult for tumors to find ways around it “escape variants” as described above this is the dcvax product that has been used in our gbm brain cancer and ovarian cancer clinical trials and is currently in our phase iii trial dcvaxl is expected to be used for any solid tumor cancers in situations in which the patient has their tumor surgically removed as part of standard of care dcvaxdirect dcvaxdirect — is designed for situations in which the tumors are inoperable — where it is not feasible or not desirable for patients to have their tumors surgically removed this includes situations in which patients have multiple metastases or for other reasons cannot have their tumors removed like dcvaxl dcvaxdirect also incorporates the full set of tumor antigens — but it does so in situ in the tumors in the patient’s body rather than at the manufacturing facility with dcvax direct the fresh new dendritic cells are partially matured in a special patentprotected way so as to be ready to pick up antigens directly from tumor tissue in the patient’s body and also communicate the information about those antigens to other agents of the immune system such as t cells the partially matured dendritic cells are then injected directly into the patient’s tumors there the dendritic cells pick up the antigens in situ rather than picking up the antigens from lysate in a lab dish at the manufacturing facility as is done with dcvaxl after that the dendritic cells in dcvaxdirect function similarly as in dcvaxl to mobilize the rest of the immune system dcvaxprostate dcvaxprostate — is designed specifically for late stage hormone independent prostate cancer such cancer involves the spread of micrometastases beyond the prostate tissue in most patients there is no focal tumor which can be surgically removed and used to make lysate or into which dendritic cells can be directly injected instead the cancer cells are diffuse we have developed a dcvax product line using a particular proprietary antigen — psma prostate specific membrane antigen — which is found on essentially all late stage hormone independent prostate cancer the psma is produced through recombinant manufacturing methods and is then combined with the fresh personalized dendritic cells to make dcvaxprostate simplicity of dcvax products for physicians and patients all of the dcvax product lines are designed to be very simple for both physicians and patients to fit within existing medical practices and procedures and to be deliverable in virtually any clinic or doctor’s office a number of complex sophisticated and proprietary technologies are required for the production and frozen storage of dcvax but these technologies are mostly deployed at the manufacturing facility and do not entail any effort or involvement by physicians or patients frontend simplicity for all dcvax product lines the precursors monocytes for the fresh new dendritic cells are obtained through a leukapheresis blood draw this blood draw can be done not only at the hospital or cancer center where the patient is being treated but at any blood center such as the red cross for dcvaxl the collection of the patient’s tumor tissue which is to be used to make lysate and provide the antigen component of the vaccine involves a simple kit the kit consists of a box with a vial which has a grinder top and is preloaded with a proprietary mix of enzymes such kits can be kept on hand like any inventory item at medical centers in the operating room after the tumor has been surgically removed instead of disposing of the tissue in the medical waste the nurse or technician chops the tissue coarsely and drops it into the vial puts the vial back into the box and hands the box to a courier pickup service such as fedex’s or ups’ life science division or a specialized courier such as world courier or quick stat for dcvaxdirect and dcvaxprostate there is no tumor tissue collection involved backend simplicity for all dcvaxl products administration to the patient involves a simple intradermal injection under the skin all dcvaxl products are stored frozen in single doses such doses are tiny and require less than  minutes to thaw dcvax must remain frozen throughout the distribution and delivery process until the time of administration to the patient and cannot be handled at room temperature before that hospitals pharmacies and physicians may need to adopt new requirements for handling distribution and delivery of dcvax there are no handling steps at the point of care except thawing the frozen dcvax product to room temperature and then loading it into a standard syringe the same type of syringe used for insulin shots there are also no intravenous infusions dcvaxl and dcvaxprostate are administered through a simple intradermal injection under the skin similar to a flu shot and are just a few drops in size with the absence of handling steps at the point of care and the simple intradermal injection these dcvax products can be delivered to patients in virtually any clinic or doctor’s office the simplicity for patients also lies in the fact that dcvax is nontoxic patients do not have to take a second set of drugs to manage side effects of dcvax follow us on  dcvax® technology about dcvax®

issues common to developmentstage companies northwest compensates cognate through a combination of cash and stock payments further cognate has provided northwest with at least one shortterm loan provided and paid in mid as of update northwest is undergoing an increase in activities as a result of expanding clinical trials which has led to increasing reliance on cognate for services and subsequent renegotiation of the agreement with cognate technologyedit the dcvax technology upon which nwbos therapies rely involves injecting cancer patients with dendritic cells which contain high levels of the same antigens found in tumor cells the immune system alerted by these antigens attacks the cancer as well as the injected cells dendritic cellsedit northwest biotherapeutics currently has three different cancer treatments in various levels of clinical trial one thing in common to all three products is the use of dendritic cells one of many types of white blood cells the basic principle behind the dcvax line of products is that if one injects or creates a large enough number of dendritic cells carrying mutant proteins matching a cancer these dendritic cells will excite enough tcells and bcells to overwhelm the cancers many defensescitation needed dcvaxledit dcvaxl is a solidtumor cancer therapy currently in phase iii clinical testing in the us canada germany and the uk for newly diagnosed gbm a common and aggressive form of brain cancer in germany it is being tested on all gliomas not just newly diagnosed gbmcitation needed in this variation of the dcvax line the tumor is removed through surgery and some of the tumor presented to the aforementioned dendritic cells for the scavenging of tumor proteins these dendritic cells laden with tumor protein antigens are then injected under the skin near lymph nodes the dendritic cells then travel to the local lymph node where the dendritic cells present the proteins to the t and b cells as previously describedcitation needed these dendritic cells are grown in the lab starting from stem cells extracted from the patients bloodcitation needed only a sugar cube sized sample of the tumor is needed for subsequent presentation to the dendritic cells the tumor sample is first broken down into constituent proteins using a caustic process known as lysing thus the l in the name dcvaxl after the resulting tumor lysate is presented to the dendritic cells they are ready for injection under the skin near the selected lymph nodes note that there are roughly  different lymph nodes in the body most are peripheral some are internal dcvaxdirectedit dcvaxdirect is the latest addition to the dcvax line and is currently in phase  trials in the uscitation needed with dcvaxdirect there is no removal of the tumor making dcvaxdirect ideal for inoperable tumors if proven effective for that reason dcvaxdirect is currently in phase  testing on patients with inoperable tumors for a very large range of cancer types in the dcvaxdirect procedure the dendritic cells are developed as in the dcvaxl process prior to antigen exposure  pulsing in direct however the subsequent exposure to tumor antigens does not occur in vitro but rather in vivo the prepared dendritic cells along with adjuncts are injected directly into one or more tumors at least two adjuncts are added to the dendritic cells one adjunct excites a general aspect of the body’s immune response while another excites a more tumor specific responsecitation needed this mixture is then injected into the patients tumor there the dendritic cells are expected to scavenge tumor proteins and then find their way to the local lymph node for presentation of the tumor protein antigens to tcells and bcells the activated tcells and bcells then travel to the tumor and kill tumor cells ruptured tumor cells would release more mutant proteins that are picked up by dendritic cells and other immune cells and carried to the lymph nodes to excite still more b and tcells this cycle repeats spiraling upward and then leveling off at a high but safe level or at least that is what is expected to be seen in the ongoing phase  trial which finished enrollment in july  dcvaxl  dcvaxdirect if effective could combine to address virtually all forms of solid tumor cancers operable and inoperable one exception might be prostate cancerwhy dcvaxprostateedit northwest completed phase ii clinicals for dcvaxprostate some time ago and received permission from the fda to move forward with a phase iiicitation needed the phase iii trial is expected to be quite large and northwest has been seeking partnering to take on that endeavor this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december  the dcvaxprostate process is similar to dcvaxl but rather than using the patients tumor as the protein source northwest utilizes a synthetic protein that was determined to be a very common mutated protein located on prostate cancer cellscitation needed this method is very different and is expected to be far more effective than the current approved immunotherapy for prostatecitation needed dendreon uses pap while nwbo uses psma according to representatives at nwbo dendreon’s target antigen pap is not expressed on all prostrate cancers they have to screen their patients to see the expression of their target nwbo’s target antigen psma is expressed on all prostrate cancers additionally with dendreon’s target the level of expression goes down as the cancer progresses the level of expression on nwbo’s target goes up as the cancer progresses another difference in the target antigens is nwbo’s target is bound to the membrane of the tumor cell “if the dcvax® hits our target” explains linda powers “it hits the cell for sure dendreon’s target is secreted by the cell so while the target is close by it is not necessarily bound to the cell in every instance antibodies can come along and glom onto to the target and not hit the cell itself which means accuracy is an issue production efficiencyedit the high cost of production for first generation dendritic cell therapies is often used as evidence that dcvaxprostate and the other dcvax therapies will not be economically viable these arguments consistently ignore the fact that northwest biotherapeutics has developed and regularly utilizes methods to freeze dendritic cells for transport and storage this gives nwbo an enormous production cost advantage over these older therapies and over current wouldbe competitors in part because it allows centralized processing of the patient samples at one enormous facility further as mentioned northwest has developed and patented automated mfg processes that further reduce cost the manufacturing processes are similar for all three of northwest’s therapies for each of the three the production process is identical regardless of the patient and even regardless of the solid tumor cancer type combined with centralized automatic mfg this greatly simplifies large scale production potentially allowing cost efficiency to reach levels unexpected for a product that is not a pill productsedit dcvaxl is now in phase  trials in usa  europe it was awarded orphan drug status dcvaxdirect is a therapy to treat inoperable solid tumors in

footnotes and references  external links business modeledit northwest relies upon the contract manufacturing organization cognate bioservices for services supporting manufacture of product for

northwest compensates cognate through a combination of cash and stock payments further cognate has provided northwest with at least one shortterm loan provided and paid in mid as of update northwest is undergoing an increase in activities as a result of expanding clinical trials which has led to increasing reliance on cognate for services and subsequent renegotiation of the agreement with cognate technologyedit the dcvax technology upon which nwbos therapies rely involves injecting cancer patients with dendritic cells which contain high levels of the same antigens found in tumor cells the immune system alerted by these antigens attacks the cancer as well as the injected cells dendritic cellsedit northwest biotherapeutics currently has three different cancer treatments in various levels of clinical trial one thing in common to all three products is the use of dendritic cells one of many types of white blood cells the basic principle behind the dcvax line of products is that if one injects or creates a large enough number of dendritic cells carrying mutant proteins matching a cancer these dendritic cells will excite enough tcells and bcells to overwhelm the cancers many defensescitation needed dcvaxledit dcvaxl is a solidtumor cancer therapy currently in phase iii clinical testing in the us canada germany and the uk for newly diagnosed gbm a common and aggressive form of brain cancer in germany it is being tested on all gliomas not just newly diagnosed gbmcitation needed in this variation of the dcvax line the tumor is removed through surgery and some of the tumor presented to the aforementioned dendritic cells for the scavenging of tumor proteins these dendritic cells laden with tumor protein antigens are then injected under the skin near lymph nodes the dendritic cells then travel to the local lymph node where the dendritic cells present the proteins to the t and b cells as previously describedcitation needed these dendritic cells are grown in the lab starting from stem cells extracted from the patients bloodcitation needed only a sugar cube sized sample of the tumor is needed for subsequent presentation to the dendritic cells the tumor sample is first broken down into constituent proteins using a caustic process known as lysing thus the l in the name dcvaxl after the resulting tumor lysate is presented to the dendritic cells they are ready for injection under the skin near the selected lymph nodes note that there are roughly  different lymph nodes in the body most are peripheral some are internal dcvaxdirectedit dcvaxdirect is the latest addition to the dcvax line and is currently in phase  trials in the uscitation needed with dcvaxdirect there is no removal of the tumor making dcvaxdirect ideal for inoperable tumors if proven effective for that reason dcvaxdirect is currently in phase  testing on patients with inoperable tumors for a very large range of cancer types in the dcvaxdirect procedure the dendritic cells are developed as in the dcvaxl process prior to antigen exposure  pulsing in direct however the subsequent exposure to tumor antigens does not occur in vitro but rather in vivo the prepared dendritic cells along with adjuncts are injected directly into one or more tumors at least two adjuncts are added to the dendritic cells one adjunct excites a general aspect of the body’s immune response while another excites a more tumor specific responsecitation needed this mixture is then injected into the patients tumor there the dendritic cells are expected to scavenge tumor proteins and then find their way to the local lymph node for presentation of the tumor protein antigens to tcells and bcells the activated tcells and bcells then travel to the tumor and kill tumor cells ruptured tumor cells would release more mutant proteins that are picked up by dendritic cells and other immune cells and carried to the lymph nodes to excite still more b and tcells this cycle repeats spiraling upward and then leveling off at a high but safe level or at least that is what is expected to be seen in the ongoing phase  trial which finished enrollment in july  dcvaxl  dcvaxdirect if effective could combine to address virtually all forms of solid tumor cancers operable and inoperable one exception might be prostate cancerwhy dcvaxprostateedit northwest completed phase ii clinicals for dcvaxprostate some time ago and received permission from the fda to move forward with a phase iiicitation needed the phase iii trial is expected to be quite large and northwest has been seeking partnering to take on that endeavor this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december  the dcvaxprostate process is similar to dcvaxl but rather than using the patients tumor as the protein source northwest utilizes a synthetic protein that was determined to be a very common mutated protein located on prostate cancer cellscitation needed this method is very different and is expected to be far more effective than the current approved immunotherapy for prostatecitation needed dendreon uses pap while nwbo uses psma according to representatives at nwbo dendreon’s target antigen pap is not expressed on all prostrate cancers they have to screen their patients to see the expression of their target nwbo’s target antigen psma is expressed on all prostrate cancers additionally with dendreon’s target the level of expression goes down as the cancer progresses the level of expression on nwbo’s target goes up as the cancer progresses another difference in the target antigens is nwbo’s target is bound to the membrane of the tumor cell “if the dcvax® hits our target” explains linda powers “it hits the cell for sure dendreon’s target is secreted by the cell so while the target is close by it is not necessarily bound to the cell in every instance antibodies can come along and glom onto to the target and not hit the cell itself which means accuracy is an issue production efficiencyedit the high cost of production for first generation dendritic cell therapies is often used as evidence that dcvaxprostate and the other dcvax therapies will not be economically viable these arguments consistently ignore the fact that northwest biotherapeutics has developed and regularly utilizes methods to freeze dendritic cells for transport and storage this gives nwbo an enormous production cost advantage over these older therapies and over current wouldbe competitors in part because it allows centralized processing of the patient samples at one enormous facility further as mentioned northwest has developed and patented automated mfg processes that further reduce cost the manufacturing processes are similar for all three of northwest’s therapies for each of the three the production process is identical regardless of the patient and even regardless of the solid tumor cancer type combined with centralized automatic mfg this greatly simplifies large scale production potentially allowing cost efficiency to reach levels unexpected for a product that is not a pill productsedit dcvaxl is now in phase

immunotherapy products to treat cancer one of the product lines dcvaxl is designed to cover all solid tumor cancers in which the tumors can be surgically removed another product line dcvaxdirect is designed for all solid tumor cancers the companys lead product dcvaxl is in an ongoing phase iii trial for diagnosed glioblastome multiforme gbm with over  trial sites its second product dcvaxdirect is being studied in a patient phase iii trial for all types of inoperable solid tumors the patient phase i stage of the trial has been completed the company is working on preparations for phase ii trials of dcvaxdirectthe companys platform technology dcvax uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patients own immune system including t cells b cells and antibodies and natural killer cells among others to attack cancer cells to attack their cancer its dcvax platform technology involves dendritic cells the master cells of the immune system and is designed to reinvigorate and educate the immune system to attack cancers the companys dcvax technology is designed to attack the full set of biomarkers or antigens on a patients cancer rather than just a particular selected target or several targetsdcvaxlthe companys product dcvaxl is designed for operable solid tumors the dcvaxl is made with cancer antigens from tumor lysate a protein extract from processed tumor cells from the patients own tumor tissue dcvaxl incorporates a set of tumor antigens making it difficult for tumors to find ways around it escape variants dcvaxl is in its patient phase iii clinical trial for gbm brain cancerdcvaxdirectthe companys product dcvaxdirect is designed for inoperable solid tumors the dcvaxdirect incorporates a set of tumor antigens in situ in the patients body rather than at the manufacturing facility with dcvax direct the fresh dendritic cells are partially matured in a way so as to be ready to pick up antigens directly from tumor tissue in the patients body and also communicate the information about those antigens to other agents of the immune system such as t cells the partially matured dendritic cells are then injected directly into the patients tumors dcvaxdirect is indicated for the treatment of inoperable solid tumors there the dendritic cells pick up the antigens in situ rather than picking up the antigens from tumor lysate in a lab dish at the
