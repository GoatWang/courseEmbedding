brooklyn company just introduced a way cool folding chair yes thats possible rockpaperrobot is blowing through the kickstarter campaign for its ollie chair by kimberly weisul kimberly weisul is an editoratlarge at inc she was previously a senior editor at businessweek weisul editoratlarge inccomweisul write a comment credit courtesy company jessica banks designs magic tricks the thing is bankss magic tricks are disguised as furniture shes the founder of rockpaperrobot a robotics furniture maker in brooklyn her newest offering the ollie chair is her companys first attempt to appeal to a massmarket audience and to make her sleight of hand more accessible to the notultrarich  without breaking the bank herself to fund manufacture and sell the chairs rockpaperrobot turned to kickstarter the campaign has raised 0 so far well beyond its initial goal of  and will end on march  at  am et along the way she says shes had quite an education in crowdfunding it takes so much time and thought to do a kickstarter she says you have to get your ducks in a row way beforehand for banks its been one more step in a creative entrepreneurial journey she studied at rodney brookss robotics lab at massachusetts institute of technology then stayed on to teach in the engineering department she has also worked as a personal assistant to comedian and nowsenator al franken her companys bestknown product the float table is composed of a few dozen cubes that seem to levitate remaining perfectly spaced from each other even as they hover in the air it costs about  then theres the brag table a large corian diamond that balances on a teeny point and costs slightly less but the ollie chair which neatly collapses with the pull of a string is available on kickstarter for a 0 contribution before the ollie chair came a folding table  or at least that was the idea banks had been working for a few years on a table designed to simply glide off a wall where it could be hung flat for storage but when she showed a friend a prototype of the table she got some unexpected feedback what about the chairs bankss response oh sh that is a fing great question fortunately designing the chair turned out to be easier than designing the table fewer moving parts for one thing her company came up with a pound indooroutdoor chair made of aluminum and teak the teak slats can be customized with artwork and the chair can be displayed just as a piece of flat art would be a pull of a string collapses the chair into a rectangle just   inches thick her reasons to launch the chair on a kickstarter went way beyond cash rockpaperrobot raised a milliondollar seed round in  and is now looking to do another banks says that in the long run her goal is to sell the ollie chair mostly to businesses  hotels cruise ships restaurants thats easier on the supply chain because manufacturers have minimum order quantities and businesses are more likely than individuals to buy lots of chairs at once on kickstarter rockpaperrobot gets to sell to individuals but the orders come in all at once making it more similar to a corporate sale this really helps us finalize the tooling and refinement and pay for the first chunk of chairs says banks kickstarter could also provide a proof of concept for a marketing campaign at the end of the kickstarter banks will know how many people rockpaperrobot targeted not just from its own mailing lists but via bloggers who cover tiny houses boating and other venues where a cool folding chair might be popular then she will be able to see how many visited the kickstarter site and how many eventually bought a chair you really have to look at kickstarter as marketing she says we wanted to price it so it was attractive so our margins are super low were paying for a lot of the shipping we want people to know about the chair banks opened up the kickstarter for ollie a day before she started publicizing it she came up with a special earlybird deal for those who bought that first day that way when she started publicizing the kickstarter the ollie chair was already selling when we said welcome aboard it looked like there were already people at the party she said the psychology of it really makes a difference similarly the  figure was part psychology and part realism she says if the kickstarter brought in only  it would have been hard but doable to fulfill the order rockpaperrobot would still have to put in about 0 or 0 for tooling but banks figured that would have been an acceptable cost to launch the product at 0 shes able to cover a lot more of the cost of a minimum order which is 8 chairs bankss kickstarter video shows the ollie chair being used all over new york she brought the chair to times square figuring that the person who poses for photos dressed as the statue of liberty is on his feet all day why not get him yes its a guy to sit down for the video but the actor dressed as the statue of liberty it turns out is on stilts and they couldnt get a clean shot of him moving onto the chair because removing the stilts is a bit complicated this being times square though another character  the naked cowboy  was soon in the video we didnt mean to get him in the video banks says his presence irritated a commenter on kickstarter who didnt like that the naked cowboy is a supporter of president trump banks had no idea her response rpr rockpaperrobot does not support trump but our chairs support everyone published on mar   the smart home goes gorgeousand fun  inccom youre about to be redirectedwe notice youre

talk about disrupting an industry jessica banks founder of rockpaperrobot is going to disrupt your furniture dont laugh banks a polymath who doublemajored in physics and creative writing sees infinite possibilities in something as seemingly simple as a table now shes using her engineering backgroundand a round of seed fundingto make them a reality the piece of furniture that put her new york citybased company on the map is essentially a spaceage coffee table called the float table its a series of wooden cubes suspended in a grid formation each cube can be gently pushed out of place before snapping back thanks to the powerful magnets embedded in each cube a float table at the studio of rockpaperrobot it was the companys first product and costs  that table represents a landmark in bankss fascinating journey from wouldbe astronaut to comedy talent scout to robotics engineer her childhood reaction to being told she was a quarterinch too short to become a space traveler thats fair because at some point youve got to pedal the space shuttle but that same  table has also put her at a crossroads for building bespoke robotic furniture and running a massmarket business now banks is hoping her carefully engineered beautifully designed furniture can reinvent how her customers think of the smart home physical objects give us a great deal of joy she says yet so much is built so that the human can ignore it in her work she says shes looking to create a favorable intrusion beauty is a welcome intrusion awe is a welcome intrusion  the rebirth of wonder banks didnt grow up tinkering and building despite growing up close to tools her father who had been a manager of industrial design for ge medical had a tempting workshop in the familys basement but my dad told me not to go into the side of the basement with the tools so i wouldnt get hurt banks recalls sometimes she couldnt resist playing with her dads electric eraser and then denying any connection to the little latex threads left around the house during high school she lost her vision for two terrifying weeks she still doesnt know why when it came back her vision was far better than  the tissue scarred in a way that i almost got natural lasik banks says but her peripheral vision was also unusually sharp and shed lost the ability to filter out irrelevant visual input banks still makes what she calls visual mistakes such as seeing separate objects overlap or blur together ill see something and think that thing is falling into that other thing she says then i realize no its notbut it could i could make that happen those visual mistakes feed her creativity now but in high school bankss altered vision pushed her to stick with math and physics because it was so tiring for her to read big blocks of text math and physics books with lots of white space surrounding the formulas were easier to comprehend she went on to study physics in college with the intention of becoming an astronaut that meant joining the military and bankss liaison officer was skeptical i was asking questions like well what if i dont like this she recalls what if you tell me to shoot and i dont want to do it instead she got a job at comedy central worked briefly as a talent scout and then as the personal assistant to al franken the documentary fast cheap and out of control which featured mit roboticist rodney brooks made her realize that robotics might marry her disparate interests she applied to brookss lab and was accepted there finally banks got the run of a workshop she describes her time at mit as the rebirth of wonder … i was walking around and could see details in ways i just couldnt before i started working with my hands again she learned to use machine tools in the lab there making up for the experience she had missed out on as a child her background in physics helped everything fit into place first i was like whoa this is how things are made she says i didnt even think about it before then i was like ok i get it this is a system just like physics is a system this is a more granular look at the world jessica banks founder of rockpaperrobot consults with furniture maker pete schlebecker their tshirts say rockpaperrobot on the front and the robot always wins on the back banks thrived at mit staying on to lecture in the engineering department then the architect frank gehry came to the university scouting for assistants banks took a leave of absence to work with himand when it was over she didnt want to come back i was in the th grade she says and no longer 0 percent committed to academia it was time to leave banks had also become fixated on a magic trick shed seen in which magnets fell very slowly through a tube how can i give people that same sense of amazement she thought it occurred to her that furniture as something everyone uses and understands would make an ideal vehicle and she knew she wanted to use cubes even though she says i very rarely think about aesthetics first a fellowship at art and technology incubator eyebeam helped her start thinking through the float table by  she had a prototype the engineering and construction challenges presented by that table were a little ridiculous most furniture is built first and then polished or finished but to construct the float table the cubes had to be perfect before they were assembled the table had to be designed so that it could be repaired even though a good deal of the tables charm comes from the fact that it doesnt appear to have any parts at all the magnets on the bottom row of cubes have to support the whole table but in the upper two rows any magnets banks added would also increase the cubes weight and therefore the difficulty in repelling any particular cube from its neighbors at a retail price of  banks wanted the tables to be beautiful which meant endless fiddling with the cubes arrangement and the grain of the wood once a table is finished the owner cant just pick it up and move it around a room so banks had to design an installation for the table as an engineer and artist i never feel like something is done banks says thats sort of a bad business model part of the reason it took so long to develop the float table is that for all her talents banks isnt a furniture maker when a friend introduced her to pete schlebecker a furniture maker and teacher with an mfa from the rhode island school of design banks knew he would be her first employee ok im committed she thought whatever i earn is his money banks demonstrates an idea for a new clock rockpaperrobot now includes four fulltime employees and nine parttimers money still comes chiefly from investors rather than customers shes sold about sixteen float tables each of which is handmade in her studio and ships with its own cleaning tools she also raised a milliondollar seed round from angels in the fall of  nonetheless one of her chief priorities is developing new pieces of furniture and home accessories that can sell for three or four figures rather than five each the magnets theoretically could be used to levitate a range of smaller objects from tissue boxes to vases levitation for the home bankss vision of the smart home has almost nothing to do with the popular conception of the phrase people talk so much about the internet of things and im like sure whatever of course everything is going to be connected she says instead banks sees the smart home as not just technologically enabled but also creative and fun after the float table she introduced the float shelf which appears to hover next to a wall shes working on a chandelier that contracts or expands as it senses people moving around a room her chandeliers current form has a basic six arms each holding a light bulb the next version will sport a more organic d printed form and the entire mass will glow as it moves it will use light to draw on the ceiling a more problematic design is one for another unconventional table which banks jokes has taken a lot of my fertile years away she hopes to unveil it at the new york international contemporary furniture fair in may and wont share details about its design before then getting it made has been harder than she expected and the consultant she hired to do the final prototyping and the design for manufacture ended up being over budget late and generally not up to the task that forced banks to do the work inhouse im exhausted she says mortally exhausted but right now i can do it this way im learning to delegate which maybe will help she apologized when i tripped over an errant flipflop explaining that shed slept in the studio the night before in the face of constant fatigue shes greatly refined her decisionmaking strategy there are no decisions she says just act and coursecorrect quickly her no decisions mantra means she now prefers less information to more not even bothering to look at weather forecastsshe just keeps an umbrella and a sweater at her workshop banks hopes things will ease up a bit after the trade show longerterm she isnt sure what form rockpaperrobot will take she doesnt find the manufacturing side of the work terribly fulfilling and can see rockpaperrobot as a design and engineering firmbut a disruptive one of course after all banks isnt interested in just pretty curves she says instead her next goal deengineering
