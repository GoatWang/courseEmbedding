fluctuate with market conditions and other factors at the time of sale your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment accordingly it is possible to lose money investing in the trust as the fund approaches its termination date the fund may earn interest income at a more modest rate as a result the funds distributions during the winddown period of approximately three to twelve months preceding the termination date may consist in whole or in part of a return of capital cmbs differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity cmbs are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrower’s payments may be received earlier than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of cmbs and will result in losses to the fund junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods because the assets of the fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not including at times when market conditions are not favorable or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy or otherwise in severe distress which may cause the fund to lose money the fund’s anticipated use of leverage by issuing preferred shares and other senior debt securities creates special risks for common shareholders

longterm bondscall risk the chance that during periods of falling interest rates issuers of callable bonds may call redeem securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity

that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of
