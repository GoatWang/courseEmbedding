strategy of the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund includes a quantitative strategic indexbased approach to commodity investing exposure to  commodities that can individually be long or flat if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash the ability to make position changes intramonth based on trends monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract why invest in the fund the longflat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable longonly commodity indices has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position longflat copper flat gold long silver long agriculture position longflat corn flat cotton flat soybeans flat sugar flat wheat flat energy position longflat crude light flat gasoline flat heating oil flat natural gas flat all data as of  and is subject to change at any time and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security when the positions within the various components are flat they will

us gaap us gaap uses a threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurement based on the activeness of the market and the transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date   the fair value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one of three levels as summarized below based on the inputs and assumptions used in deriving fair value     · level  inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they are traded   · level  inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities obtained from independent brokers andor market makers in each security   · level  inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are

there are conditions or events that in the aggregate raise substantial doubt about the fund’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued substantial doubt would exist if conditions or events indicate that the fund will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due   accounting standards update  is effective for annual periods ending after december   however early adoption is permitted the manager is currently assessing the impact if any that this pronouncement will have on the disclosures within the financial statements

continued   the fair value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one of three levels as summarized below based on the inputs and assumptions used in deriving fair value     · level  inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they are traded   · level  inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities obtained from independent brokers andor market makers in each security   · level  inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are significant in arriving at fair value   gait’s investments in master funds and graham cash assets llc “cash assets” have been valued at net asset value using the practical expedient according to fasb accounting standards update  – disclosures for investment in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent “asu ” these investments are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy gait’s investments in master funds and cash assets are discussed in notes  and  there were no level  assets or liabilities held at any point during the nine months ended september   or the year ended december   by gait the master funds or cash assets and there were no transfers between levels during those periods transfers between levels if any are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that cause the transfer   derivative instruments   in the normal course of business the master funds utilize derivative financial instruments in connection with their trading activities derivative instruments derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors investments in derivative financial instruments are subject to additional risks that can result in a loss of all or part of an investment the master funds’ derivative financial instruments are classified by the following primary underlying risks interest rate foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and equity price risks these risks can be in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition in addition the master funds are also subject to additional counterparty risk should their counterparties fail to meet the terms of their contracts management of counterparty risk involves a number of considerations such as the financial profile of the counterparty specific terms and duration of the contractual agreement and the value of collateral held if any the master funds have established initial credit approval credit limits and collateral requirements and may reduce their exposure to any counterparties they deem necessary trading in nonus dollar denominated derivative instruments may subject the value of and gains and losses associated with such contracts to additional risks related to adverse changes in the applicable exchange rates   unrealized gains and losses from derivative financial instruments are recorded based on changes in their fair value realized gains and losses are recorded when the positions are closed all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments are included in net gain loss on investments in the master funds’ statements of operations      index graham alternative investment trading llc   notes to unaudited financial statements continued    summary of significant accounting policies continued   derivative instruments continued   futures contracts   the master funds use futures contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in the value of equities commodities interest rates bonds and foreign currencies futures contracts are valued based upon the closing price as of the valuation date established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded   a futures contract represents a commitment for the future purchase or sale of an asset or cash settlement based on the value of an asset on a specified date the purchase and sale of futures contracts are executed on an exchange which requires margin deposits with a futures commission merchant “fcm” subsequent payments are made or received by the master funds each day depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract these changes in valuation are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the master funds relative to overthecounter derivative financial instruments futures contracts provide reduced counterparty risk to the master funds since futures are exchangetraded and the exchanges’ clearing house guarantees the futures against default however some nonus exchanges are “principals’ markets” in which no common clearing facility exists and the master funds may look only to the clearing broker for performance of the contract the us commodity exchange act requires an fcm to segregate all funds received from such fcm’s customers in respect of regulated futures transactions if the fcm were not to do so to the full extent required by law the assets of the master funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the fcm in that case the master funds would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the fcm’s combined customer accounts even though certain property specifically traceable to the master funds was held by the fcm in addition in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house the master funds might experience a loss of funds deposited through its fcm as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions   forward contracts   the master funds enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in exchange rates forward currency transactions are contracts or agreements for delivery of specific currencies or the cash equivalent value at a specified future date and an agreed upon price forward contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or clearing house and therefore the risks include the inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the terms of the contracts as well as the risks associated with movements in fair value   exchange traded forward contracts are valued based upon the settlement prices as of the valuation date established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded all other forward contracts are valued based upon a forward curve constructed using independently quoted forward points changes in fair value of each forward contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses      index graham alternative investment trading llc   notes to unaudited financial statements continued    summary of significant accounting policies continued   derivative instruments continued   swap contracts   the master funds may enter into various swap contracts in an attempt to take advantage of changes in interest rates and asset values exchange traded interest rate swap contracts are executed on an exchange which requires margin deposits with a central clearing counterparty “ccp” subsequent payments are made or received by the master funds each day depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract these changes in valuation are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the master funds relative to overthecounter interest rate swap contracts exchange traded interest rate swap contracts provide reduced counterparty risk since they are exchangetraded and the exchange’s clearinghouse guarantees against default the commodity exchange act requires a ccp to segregate all funds received from such ccp’s customers in respect of exchange traded interest rate swaps if the ccp were not to do so to the full extent required by law the assets of the master funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the ccp in that case the master funds would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the ccp’s combined customer accounts even though certain property specifically traceable to the master funds is held by the ccp in addition in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house the master funds could experience a loss of funds deposited through its ccp as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house the loss of unrealized profits on its open positions and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions all funds deposited with both us and nonus ccps are included in due from brokers on the statements of financial condition over the counter swap contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or an affiliated clearing house or regulated by any us or foreign government authorities failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation under the terms of the swap contract could result in the loss of any unrealized gains on open positions it may not be possible to dispose of or close out a swap position without the consent of the counterparty and the master funds may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover its risk   an interest rate swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified rates for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets the payment flows are usually netted against each other with the difference being paid by one party to another interest rate swap positions are generally valued as the present value of the net future cash flows as estimated by the advisor using a discount curve constructed from independently obtained future interest rate assumptions   a total return swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to exchange cash flows calculated by reference to changes in specified prices for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets the payment flows are usually netted against each other with the difference being paid by one party to another total return swaps are generally valued based upon the value of the underlying instruments as determined by the primary exchange on which they are traded   exchange traded swaps are valued based upon the last traded prices established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded changes in fair value of each swap are recognized as unrealized gains or losses the master funds record realized gains or losses when a swap contract is terminated      index graham alternative investment trading llc   notes to unaudited financial statements continued    summary of significant accounting policies continued   derivative instruments continued   options   the master funds may buy and sell covered and uncovered exchange traded and overthecounter options on futures foreign currencies commodities interest rates and equities to take advantage of the price movements of the financial instrument underlying the option or to hedge positions in the underlying assets option contracts give one party the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a limited time or on a specified date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price options may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices or prices   when purchasing options the master funds are exposed to counterparty risk to the extent that a seller of an overthecounter option does not meet its obligations under the terms of the option contract the maximum risk of loss to the master funds is the unrealized gains of the contracts and the premiums paid to purchase its open option contracts relative to overthecounter options exchange traded options provide reduced counterparty risk to the master funds since the exchanges’ clearinghouse guarantees the option against default   selling uncovered options may subject the master funds to unlimited risk of loss as the writer of an option the master funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying instrument   exchange traded options are valued based upon the settlement prices published as of the valuation date by the principal exchange upon which they are traded in the absence of an exchange published settlement price the option will be valued using the last reported sales price reported on the exchange for the valuation
