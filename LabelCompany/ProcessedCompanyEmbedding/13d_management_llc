activist his track record the sector and the activist’s track record in that sector additionally we look at the activist strategy that will be employed and the type of returns that strategy typically creates we also make a judgment on the probability for success of the filing based on the activist’s experience the shareholder base and other factors the fundamental analysis of the company is largely outsourced to the activist our investments are spread among many top activists with different activist styles strategies and sector expertise the average holding period for these types of d investments is  months the success of the fund does not depend on being able to capture the initial price bump that occurs when a d is filed in fact we expect that we will never capture the return on that price bump for the types of investments we focus on investments in companies with  billion market caps by premium activist investors d monitor data shows that historically there is an average  oneday bump in the stock price however d monitor data also shows that these d filings produce an average return during their month life that outperforms the sp  index by approximately  after the  bump we focus on capturing this longterm growth for shareholders and are not as concerned with any initial small bump in return   the difference between the closing price on the day prior to the d following and the closing price on the day following the d filing is referred to as the “bump”  the sp ® is regarded as a gauge of large cap us equities the index includes  leading companies in

documents ▼ download literature and forms submit request news ▼ portfolio manager interviews in the news contact us shareholder login history the fund was founded on december   by ken squire who serves as the chief investment strategist of the d activist fund after graduating from new york university school of law in  ken practiced corporate and securities law for five years at weil gotshal  manges he left the practice of law in  and joined private equity firm crown capital group after nine years as a private equity investor in april of  ken founded d monitor a subscriptionbased research company that specializes in d filings and shareholder activism d monitor reviews and analyzes approximately  d filings and  d amendments each year and writes reports on the material filings at any given time d monitor is following between  and  material activist campaigns ken quickly became a leading commentator in this industry penning “the activist spotlight” weekly column in barron’s since  and regularly appearing on cnbc and bloomberg tv ken also hosts the largest conference dedicated to activism where all of the major activists come to speak as a result ken has developed deep relationships with virtually every major activist investor and speaks with them and others in the activist community on a regular basis since its launch in  d monitor has become the preeminent qualitative subscriptionbased service for the institutional investor community with clients that include most of the major investment banks and many of the top hedge funds pension funds institutional investors and law firms with d monitor established as the premier subscription research service for the institutional investor community ken began thinking about how he could apply his research and expertise for the benefit of individual investors he came to three conclusions i shareholder activism has been a successful strategy that has historically outperformed the market ii we know of no way for individuals to invest in activism and iii we know of no one else who is as focused on this area like ken is given his focus since  on nothing but analyzing d filings developing relationships with the activists and the activist community and becoming deeply familiar with the styles habits and philosophies of activist investors so in december of  ken squire launched the d activist fund to give individual and institutional investors access to the strategy of shareholder activism in a lowcost liquid transparent investment vehicle please remember that past performance may not be indicative and
