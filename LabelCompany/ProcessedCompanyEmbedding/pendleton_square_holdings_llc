leave behind “ john allston private family trust company our commitment at pendleton square trust and family office is to assist families in establishing and operating a tennesseechartered private family trust company the pendleton square leadership team has extensive experience with this process and our goal is to help families and their attorneys navigate the regulatory requirements and to provide ongoing support and infrastructure a private family trust company pftc is a legal entity that provides trust and fiduciary services to a singlefamily group it is a statechartered regulated entity and therefore is not permitted to do business with the public for families of sufficient wealth the pftc is an attractive alternative to the use of either corporate or individual trustees as the pftc is owned entirely by members of the same family a pftc is not necessarily a family office but can include the functions of a family office or act as an affiliate of an existing family office an existing or newly formed corporation or limited liability company can form a tennessee private family trust company through an application with the tennessee department of financial institutions tennessee has been selected by several families and their advisors as the jurisdiction for their private family trust companies based on tennessee’s favorable trust statutes and income tax structure tennessee has demonstrated a commitment to families to offer a jurisdiction which accommodates the unique issues facing a family private family trust companies offer many advantages to families continuity in fulfilling fiduciary obligations the pftc can provide continuity as well as provide a means to provide structure in administering the many trusts of the family traditionally families have chosen trustees who are family members advisors or commercial trustees with whom they have personal professional or business relationships pftcs allow the family to continue to involve these family members advisors and institutions in similar functions while serving the pftc stability of staff commercial fiduciaries can undergo mergers modifications to their service models and may be unable to retain qualified personnel with whom the beneficiaries have established a strong ongoing relationship the pftc provides a known successor as the family trustee limits liability a family member or other individual serving as trustee will have personal liability for their decisions the pftc eliminates fiduciary liability risk for family members and other individuals serving as trustee but still allows these individuals to maintain an active role in the governance of the pftc flexibility in investing a pftc has the flexibility to invest in various types of investments that a commercial trust company may prefer not to hold eg concentrated positions alternative investments real estate private equity etc additionally the pftc has the ability to manage unique assets such as a family operating business or family investment partnerships better organized a pftc provides a structure for the administration of families’ trusts through a corporate organization including a board an investment committee and a distribution committee thereby providing longterm governance and a succession plan for the family the pftc will usually retain professional service providers to manage the trusts but allow for family involvement in the various operational committees and governance cost effective a pftc has no profit motive and no conflicts of interest so the trust administration costs can be more effectively managed since a pftc may structure its services to the family’s needs and retain outsourced service providers the operational costs may be significantly reduced confidentiality a pftc provides the family confidentiality of wealth transfer strategies investment activities and distributions vs a large bank trust department atmosphere pendleton square trust and
