rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher

regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the board of the parent regulated fund would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the parent

and committees of portfolio managers analysts and senior management “investment teams” and “investment committees” responsible for evaluating investment opportunities and making investment decisions on behalf of clients are promptly notified of the opportunities if the requested order is granted the advisers will establish maintain and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that when such opportunities arise the advisers to the relevant regulated funds are promptly notified and receive the same information about the opportunity as any other advisers considering the opportunity for their clients in particular consistent with condition  if a potential coinvestment transaction falls within the thencurrent objectives and strategies  and any boardestablished

an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the regulated fund in light of the regulated funds thencurrent circumstances if the adviser to a regulated fund deems the regulated funds participation in such potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate then it will formulate a recommendation regarding the proposed order amount for the regulated fund

as placed if on the other hand the aggregate internal orders for a potential coinvestment transaction exceed the size of the investment opportunity immediately prior to the external submission then the allocation of the opportunity will be made pro rata on the basis of the size of the internal orders if subsequent to such external submission the size of the opportunity is increased or decreased or if the terms of such opportunity or the facts and circumstances applicable to the regulated funds or the affiliated funds consideration of the opportunity change the participants will be permitted to submit revised internal orders in accordance with written start printed page allocation policies and procedures that the advisers will establish implement and maintain b followon investments  applicants state that from time to time the regulated funds and affiliated funds may have opportunities to make followon investments  in an issuer in which a regulated fund and one or more other regulated funds andor affiliated funds previously have invested  applicants propose that followon investments would be divided into two categories depending on whether the prior investment was a coinvestment transaction or a preboarding investment if the regulated funds and affiliated funds had previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the standard review followons described in condition  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds have not previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer but hold a preboarding investment then the terms and approval of the followon investment would be subject to the enhancedreview followons described in condition  all enhanced review followons require the approval of the required majority for a given issuer the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds would need to comply with the requirements of enhancedreview followons only for the first coinvestment transaction subsequent coinvestment transactions with respect to the issuer would be governed by the requirements of standard review followons  a regulated fund would be permitted to invest in standard review followons either with the approval of the required majority under condition c or without board approval under condition b if it is i a pro rata followon investment  or ii a nonnegotiated followon investment applicants believe that these pro rata and nonnegotiated followon investments do not present a significant opportunity for overreaching on the part of any adviser and thus do not warrant the time or the attention of the board pro rata followone investments and nonnegotiated followon investments remain subject to the boards periodic review in accordance with condition  c dispositions  applicants propose that dispositions  would be divided into two categories if the regulated funds and affiliated funds holding investments in the issuer had previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer then the terms and approval of the disposition would be subject to the standard review dispositions described in condition  if the regulated funds and affiliated funds have not previously participated in a coinvestment transaction with respect to the issuer but hold a preboarding investment then the terms and approval of the disposition would be subject to the enhanced review dispositions described in condition  subsequent dispositions with respect to the same issuer would be governed by condition  under the standard review dispositions  a regulated fund may participate in a standard review disposition either with the approval of the required majority under condition d or without board approval under condition c if i the disposition is a pro rata disposition  or ii the securities are tradable securities  and the disposition meets the other requirements of condition cii pro rata dispositions and dispositions of a tradable security remain subject to the boards periodic review in accordance with condition  d delayed settlement  applicants

a regulated fund the “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating coinvestment transactions because the ability of the adviser or its principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly the independent directors shall evaluate and approve any independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan” as defined in the rule without prior approval by the commission by order upon application section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated funds that are registered closedend investment companies  similarly with regard to bdcs section a of the act generally prohibits certain persons specified in section b from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by the bdc in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commissions rules under section d of the act applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a because the commission has not adopted any rules under section a rule d also applies to joint transactions with regulated funds that are bdcs  coinvestment transactions are prohibited by either or both of rule d and section a without a prior exemptive order of the commission to the extent that the affiliated funds and the regulated funds participating in such transactions fall within the category of persons described by rule d andor section b as applicable visàvis each participating regulated fund each of the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons visàvis a regulated fund within the meaning of section a by reason of common control because i controlled affiliates of agm manage each of the affiliated funds and asfrf and aif and may be deemed to control any future regulated fund ii agm controls aim which manages aic and iii aic downstream funds are and in the future will be deemed to be controlled by aim aic or certain of aics subsidiaries thus each of the affiliated funds could be deemed to be a person related to the aic funds in a manner described by section b and related to the other regulated funds in a manner described by rule d and therefore the prohibitions of rule d and section a would apply respectively to prohibit the affiliated funds from participating in coinvestment transactions with the regulated funds  in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers whether the companys participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less

of the act iv whose investment adviser is an adviser and v that is not a whollyowned investment sub back to citation   applicants believe that allowing the other regulated funds and the affiliated funds to coinvest with merx does not raise any legal or policy concerns that are not otherwise raised by allowing a regulated fund to coinvest with another regulated fund andor one or more affiliated funds because in terms of its operation and purpose merx differs from a private fund only in that it invests in and operates aircraft subject to leases instead of in investment securities back to citation   applicants state that although athene and midcap may not rely on section c cc or c of the act as do the other existing affiliated funds applicants do not believe that allowing athene and midcap to participate in coinvestment transactions as affiliated funds raises any additional legal or policy concerns not otherwise raised by allowing a regulated fund to coinvest with one or more affiliated funds specifically applicants argue that athene and midcap are clients of advisers the same way that an affiliated fund relying on section c or c is a client of an adviser although a relatively small portion of athenes assets are managed by an investment adviser that is not an adviser only the portion of athenes assets for which an adviser has investment discretion will participate in coinvestment transactions athene and midcap may continue to be an affiliated fund in the future if it instead relies solely on section c cc or c and otherwise satisfies the criteria for

meaning that they will be based on observable information such as industrysector of the issuer minimum ebitda of the issuer asset class of the investment opportunity or required commitment size and not on characteristics that involve a discretionary assessment the adviser to the regulated fund may from time to time recommend criteria for the boards consideration but boardestablished criteria will only become effective if approved by a majority of the independent directors the independent directors of a regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of any

subject to section o in the case of a bdc downstream fund with a transaction committee or advisory committee the committee members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the bdc downstream fund were a bdc subject to section o and as if the committee members were directors of the fund back to citation   the advisers will maintain records of all proposed order amounts internal

citation   however if the size of the opportunity is decreased such that the aggregate of the original internal orders would exceed the amount of the remaining investment opportunity then upon

which a regulated fund participates together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds i in which the only term negotiated by or on behalf of the funds is price and ii

review the proposed followon investment not only on a standalone basis but also in relation to the total economic exposure in such issuer ie in combination with the portion of the preboarding

the life of the regulated fund to allow each regulated fund to dispose of its entire position remaining after the proposed disposition within a short period of time not exceeding  days at approximately the value as defined by section a of the act at which the regulated fund has valued the investment back to citation   applicants state this may occur for two reasons first when the affiliated fund or regulated fund is not yet fully funded because when the affiliated fund or regulated fund desires to make an investment it must call capital from its investors to obtain the financing to make the investment and in these instances the notice requirement to call capital could be as much as ten business days second where for tax or regulatory reasons an affiliated fund or regulated fund does not purchase new issuances immediately upon issuance but only after a short seasoning period of up to ten business days back to citation   for example procuring the regulated funds investment in a potential coinvestment transaction to permit an affiliate to complete or obtain better terms in a separate transaction would constitute an indirect financial benefit back to citation

company or series thereof as a bdc for this purpose and any limited partner holding  or more of the relevant limited partner interests that would be a close affiliate but for the exclusion in that definition back to citation   in the case of any disposition proportionality will be measured by each participating regulated funds and affiliated funds outstanding investment in the security in question immediately preceding the disposition back to citation   in determining whether a holding is “immaterial” for purposes of the order the required majority will consider whether the nature and extent of the interest in the transaction or arrangement is sufficiently small that a reasonable person would not believe that the interest affected the determination of whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement or the terms of the transaction or arrangement back to citation   to the extent that a followon investment opportunity is in a security or arises in respect of a security held by the participating regulated funds and affiliated funds proportionality will be measured by each participating regulated funds and affiliated funds outstanding investment in the security in question immediately preceding the followon investment using the most recent available valuation thereof to the extent that a followon investment opportunity relates to an opportunity to invest in a security that is not in respect of any security held by any of the participating regulated funds or affiliated funds proportionality will be measured by each participating regulated funds and

is no guarantee of future results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of
