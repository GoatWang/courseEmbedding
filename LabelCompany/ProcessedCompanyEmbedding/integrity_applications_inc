devices in order to determine optimal timing and dosage for corrective treatments such as insulin whereas glucotrack provides patients with noninvasive spot blood glucose measurements that can be used for this purpose without the need for trend analysis among the companies developing noninvasive glucose testing devices are echo therapeutics inc glucolight c and grove instruments cygnus a company subsequently acquired by johnson  johnson obtained fda approval and a ce mark in  for a noninvasive trend analysis device that was marketed under the name glucowatch however the device is no longer commercially available other companies developing continuous measurement devices based on minimally invasive methods such as implants or subdermal needles include medtronic inc abbot laboratories and dexcom inc some of our competitors are either publicly traded or are divisions of publiclytraded companies and they enjoy several competitive advantages including · significantly greater name recognition · established relations with healthcare professionals customers and third party payors · established distribution networks · additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage · greater experience in conducting research and development manufacturing clinical trials obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products and · greater financial and human resources for product development sales and marketing and patent litigation some of our other competitors also enjoy these competitive advantages as a result we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products to our knowledge a summary of

glucose levels by using infrared light to detect hypoglycemia in the patient company description we are a development stage medical device company focused on the design development and commercialization of noninvasive glucose monitoring devices for use by persons suffering from diabetes our whollyowned subsidiary integrity israel was founded in  with a mission to develop produce and market noninvasive glucose monitors for home use by diabetics we have developed a noninvasive blood glucose monitor the glucotrack® glucose monitoring device which is designed to help people with diabetes obtain blood glucose level readings without the pain inconvenience cost and difficulty of conventional invasive spot finger stick devices the glucotrack dff utilizes a patented combination of ultrasound electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain blood glucose measurements in less than one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected to a small handheld control and display unit all without drawing blood we expect to begin the performance and safety stage of formal clinical trials in israel and europe by the second quarter of  and expect to begin clinical trials in the united states by late  if our clinical trial protocol is approved by the us food and drug administration the glucotrack dff has not yet been approved for commercial sale in the united states the european union or any other jurisdiction there can be no assurance that approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction will be obtained we have not yet generated any revenues from our operations and have incurred losses of  during the year ended december   and  during the six months ended june   we are dependent upon external sources for financing our operations and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations as a result our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern preclinical trials integrity israel conducted preclinical trials involving over  readings from approximately  patients over the last seven years clinical data collected during  at the soroka university medical center in be’er sheva israel indicate a positive correlation between glucotrack dff readings and those obtained from conventional invasive devices more specifically a set of preclinical trials conducted on  patients of various weights ages diabetes types and genders involved  measurements of which  were within the clinically acceptable zones zones a and b of the clarke error grid which we refer to as the ceg similarly approximately  of the measurements in an at home study of four participants were within clinically acceptable zones a and b of the ceg measurements are clinically acceptable as compared to a referenced invasive device when the variance if any between the devices would have no worse than a benign effect on the patients these preclinical trials involved small patient populations because of the small sample size the results of these preclinical trials may not be indicative of future results analyses from the at home study show that there are a few parameters that reduce accuracy such as the learning curve the use of a home use device as a reference failure to properly follow instructions for use including use of the reference invasive device  and the variability of the ambient temperature in a given testing environment  we have already made some modifications to the glucotrack dff to limit the effect of these parameters and further modifications are in process  including the addition of a sensor to gauge the ambient temperature in the testing environment and modifications to the software utilized by the glucotrack device to take the ambient temperature into account in determining the patient’s blood glucose level while we believe that these modifications will improve the results of the glucotrack device no assurance can be given as to the extent if any to which these modifications will improve the effectiveness of the device  we believe that the results of the home study show that with some modifications to the glucotrack dff we will be able to improve the accuracy and reliability measurements of glucose levels in the home and homelike environments  our principal executive
