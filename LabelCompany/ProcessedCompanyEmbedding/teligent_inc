securities and exchange commission  teligent inc does not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements contained in this document as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law nongaap financial measures in addition to reporting financial information required in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap teligent is also presenting ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are nongaap financial measures since ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before research and development costs are nongaap financial measures they should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap in addition teligents definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap financial measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda as defined by the company is calculated as follows net income loss plus depreciation expense amortization of intangibles interest expense net noncash interest expense provision for income taxes inventory step up and acquisition costs related to acquisitions foreign currency exchange gainloss noncash expenses such as sharebased compensation expense and preferred stock dividend the company believes that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful indicator to both company management and investors of the past and expected ongoing operating performance of the company ebitda is a commonly used and widely accepted measure of financial performance adjusted ebitda is deemed by the company to be a useful performance indicator because it includes an add back of noncash and nonrecurring operating expenses which have little to no bearing on cash flows and may be subject to uncontrollable factors not reflective of the companys true operational performance while the company uses ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before research and development costs in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes these nongaap financial measures to be useful to investors in evaluating the companys performance it is open to certain shortcomings ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not take into account the impact of capital expenditures on either the liquidity or the financial performance of the company and likewise omit sharebased compensation expenses which may vary over time and may represent a material portion of overall compensation expense  due to the inherent limitations of ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before research and development costs the companys management utilizes comparable gaap financial measures to evaluate the business in conjunction with ebitda and adjusted ebitda and encourages investors to do likewise the company also presents a nongaap financial measure of adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per diluted share to the show the adjusted net income when ebitda adjustments are added back or subtracted out of the traditional gaap reported net income loss  adjusted diluted earnings per share as defined by the company is equal to adjusted net income
