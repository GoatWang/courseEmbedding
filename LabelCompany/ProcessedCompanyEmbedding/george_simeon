by joseph demarteau while simenons own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city including politics bars and cheap hotels but also crime police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist edmond locard simenons experience at the gazette also taught him the art of quick editing he wrote

his g sim pseudonym writing as monsieur le coq he also published more than  humorous pieces between november  and december citation needed he stopped writing for the gazette in december  during this

through it from  to  he used a total of  pen names while writing  novels and short stories in france –edit simenons father died in  and this served as the occasion for the author to move to paris with régine renchon hereafter referred to by her nickname tigy at first living in the th arrondissement not far from the boulevard des batignolles he became familiar with the city its bistros cheap hotels bars and restaurants more importantly he also came to know ordinary workingclass parisians writing under numerous pseudonyms he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends simenon and tigy returned briefly to liège in march  to marry despite his catholic upbringing simenon was not a believer tigy came from a thoroughly nonreligious family however simenons mother insisted on a church wedding forcing tigy to become a nominal convert learning the catholic churchs catechism despite their fathers lack of religious convictions all of simenons children would be baptized as catholics marriage to tigy however did not prevent simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women perhaps most famously josephine baker a reporting assignment had simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in  giving him a taste for boating in  he decided to have a boat built the ostrogoth simenon tigy their cook and housekeeper henriette liberge and their dog olaf lived on board the ostrogoth travelling the french canal system henriette liberge known as boule literally ball a reference to her slight pudginess was romantically involved with simenon for the next several decades and would

written at joseph kessels request this first ever maigret detective story was written while boating in the netherlands particularly in and around the dutch town of delfzijl a statue of maigret in delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this  saw simenon travel extensively sending back reports from africa eastern europe turkey and the soviet union a trip around the world followed in  and  between

in  simenon lived in the vendée during the second world war simenons conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the germans while others disagree viewing simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the gestapo suspected him of being jewish apparently conflating the names simenon and simon in any case simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with german studios during the occupation and in  was sentenced to a fiveyear period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work this sentence however was kept from the public and had little practical effect the war years did see simenon produce a number of important works including le testament donadieu le voyageur de la toussaint and le cercle des mahé he also conducted important correspondence most notably with andré gide also in the early s simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition a reminder of his father giving him only months to live it was also at this time that tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and boule he and tigy remained married until  but it was now a marriage in name only despite tigys initial protests boule remained with the family the ambiguities of the war years

lengthy car trips traveling from maine to florida and then west as far as california simenon lived for a short time on anna maria island near bradenton florida before renting a house in nogales arizona where boule was finally reunited with him his novel the bottom of the bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in nogales although enchanted by the desert simenon decided to leave arizona and following a stay in california settled into a large house shadow rock farm in lakeville connecticut this town forms the background for his  novel la mort de belle the death of belle while in the united states simenon and his son marc learned to speak english with relative ease as did boule tigy however had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to europe in the meantime simenon had met denyse ouimet a woman seventeen years his junior denyse who was originally from montréal met simenon in new york city in  she was to be hired as a secretary and they promptly

director of the organic trade association said that the amendment was intended to protect the industry from the harvey ruling and will not change the status quo if applied the judges ruling would have forced many manufacturers to stop using the usda organic seal and instead relabel products to state for instance cookies made with organic flour or frozen lasagna made with organic tomatoesmany in the organic industry say they are willing to allow some use of synthetics in organic food since  the national organic standards board a member panel of advisers appointed by the agriculture department has served as the gatekeeper for such substances in that time  have been approved many of them relatively harmless ingredients like baking powder pectin ascorbic acid and carbon dioxidebut joseph mendelson legal director at the center for food safety a liberal advocacy group says that the proposed legislation will open the door to a range of other chemicals and artificial materials including a large category of socalled food contact substances  things like boiler additives disinfectants and lubricants with unpronounceable namesmost of these substances would not end up in finished products in detectable amounts but many in the organic community say that these tools of mainstream food processing do not belong in organic productionwe dont want organic food manufacturers having carte blanche use of the same kind of synthetics that conventional food processors use especially when it involves things that do not appear on the ingredient panels said james a riddle chairman of the national organic standards board i think people choose to buy organic food because they dont use all those things newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by

same time charles sweat chief operating officer at earthbound farm the countrys largest grower of organic produce said he was concerned with the section of the spending bill that gives the agriculture department authority to grant temporary exemptions to allow conventionally grown ingredients like corn soybean oil or tomatoes in organic food when organic versions are not commercially available advertisement continue reading the main story we see this as opening up a pandoras box mr sweat said any company that cant compete because something is too expensive could go to the secretary and claim they need an exemptiongeorge simeon chief executive of organic valley a cooperative of mostly small organic dairy farmers wrestled with the high cost of organic production a little over a year ago when walmart asked for a  percent price cut for three years organic valley had been walmarts primary supplier of organic milkwalmart allows you to really build market share mr simeon said but were about our values and being able to sustain our farmers if a customer wants to stretch us to the point where were not able to deliver our mission then we have to find different marketsmr simeon told walmart to get a new supplierdean foods horizon organic was better equipped to satisfy walmarts demands horizon gets about  percent of its production from a cow organic dairy in paul idaho which is small in comparison with many conventional dairy farms but huge by organic standardsmark kastel senior farm policy analyst at cornucopia a group representing small dairy farmers contends that horizon is able to run such a large farm because it dilutes organic principles earlier this year his group filed a petition arguing that the idaho farm crams too many cows into a confined area where most of them do not graze on pasture but instead consume a highgrain dietthese factory farms are trying to cut corners mr kastel said when you feed more caloriedense grains you get more milkhorizon which also buys milk from  family farms says it is making changes and will divide its idaho operation into two separate farms so that there will be three to five cows for each acre of pasturewe want to meet the regulations said kelly oshea horizons director of government and industry relations and see integrity in the organic standards advertisement continue reading the main story the national organic standards board has been trying to persuade the agriculture department to clarify its vague rule that to produce organic milk dairy cows besides receiving only organic feed and avoiding growth hormones and antibiotics must have access to pasture it wants to require that milk labeled organic come from cows that get at least  percent of their diet from pasture grass for a minimum of  days a yearmr kastel of cornucopia estimates that roughly  percent of the organic milk sold in the united states comes from cows that are not on pasture most of them from two large dairies run by aurora organic dairy an offshoot of what was once the countrys largest conventional dairy company organic milk is the most popular organic product and sells for up to twice the price of regular milkon a recent visit to auroras farm in platteville colo at the foot of the rocky mountains thousands of holsteins were seen confined to grassless dirtlined pens and eating from a long trough filled with  percent hay and  percent grains mostly corn and soybeansof the  cows on the farm just a few hundred  those between milking cycles or near the end of their lactation  were sitting or grazing on small patches of pastureaurora executives say that despite the lack of pasture their cows are very healthy and happy the  million gallons of milk the farm produces each year are supplied mainly to supermarkets and sold under store brands like safeway select kirkland at costco and archer farms at targetmark retzloff president of aurora organic said he did not agree with the national organic standards boards proposed pasture rule but added that he was planning to add  acres of grazing land to the farm the company is also building a new dairy in a layout that mr retzloff said would be conducive to putting thousands of cows on pasture and still milking them three times a daysuch tensions are likely to remain whatever the new legislation allows sheryl olaughlin chief executive of clif bar which makes organic energy bars says that while the difficulty of operating organically and finding natural ingredients often ends up raising production costs it is also what gives the category its purity and its appealthe organic industry ms olaughlin said has got to put pressure on itself to find alternative solutions continue reading the main story we’re interested in your

fathers heart condition as a pretext simenon decided to put an end to his studies in june  not even taking the collège saintlouis yearend exams he subsequently worked a number of very shortterm odd jobs career beginningsedit in january  the yearold simenon took a job at the gazette de liège a newspaper edited by joseph demarteau while simenons own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city including politics bars and cheap hotels but also crime police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist edmond locard simenons experience at the gazette also taught him the art of quick editing he wrote more than  articles under the pen name g simcitation needed he began submitting stories to le matin in the early s simenons first novel au pont des arches was written in june  and published in  under his g sim pseudonym writing as monsieur le coq he also published more than  humorous pieces between november  and december citation needed he stopped writing for the gazette in december  during this period simenons familiarity with nightlife prostitutes drunkenness and carousing increased the people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists bohemian artists and even two future murderers the latter appearing in his novel les trois crimes de mes amis he also frequented a group of artists known as la caque while not really involved in the group he did meet his future wife régine renchon through it from  to  he used a total of  pen names while writing  novels and short stories in france –edit simenons father died in  and this served as the occasion for the author to move to paris with régine renchon hereafter referred to by her nickname tigy at first living in the th arrondissement not far from the boulevard des batignolles he became familiar with the city its bistros cheap hotels bars and restaurants more importantly he also came to know ordinary workingclass parisians writing under numerous pseudonyms he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends simenon and tigy returned briefly to liège in march  to marry despite his catholic upbringing simenon was not a believer tigy came from a thoroughly nonreligious family however simenons mother insisted on a church wedding forcing tigy to become a nominal convert learning the catholic churchs catechism despite their fathers lack of religious convictions all of simenons children would be baptized as catholics marriage to tigy however did not prevent simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women perhaps most famously josephine baker a reporting assignment had simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in  giving him a taste for boating in  he decided to have a boat built the ostrogoth simenon tigy their cook and housekeeper henriette liberge and their dog olaf lived on board the ostrogoth travelling the french canal system henriette liberge known as boule literally ball a reference to her slight pudginess was romantically involved with simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family really part of it maigret statue in delfzijl in  the most famous character invented by simenon commissaire maigret made his first appearance in a piece in detective written at joseph kessels request this first ever maigret detective story was written while boating in the netherlands particularly in and around the dutch town of delfzijl a statue of maigret in delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this  saw simenon travel extensively sending back reports from africa eastern europe turkey and the soviet union a trip around the world followed in  and  between  and  simenon tigy and boule lived at la richardière a thcentury manor house in marsilly at the charentemaritime département the house is evoked in simenons novel le testament donadieu at the beginning of  he rented the villa agnès in la rochelle and published la suspect and then in august purchased a farm house in nieulsurmer also in the charentemaritime where his and tigys only child marc was born in  simenon lived in the vendée during the second world war simenons conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the germans while others disagree viewing simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the gestapo suspected him of being jewish apparently conflating the names simenon and simon in any case simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with german studios during the occupation and in  was sentenced to a fiveyear period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work this sentence however was kept from the public and had little practical effect the war years did see simenon produce a number of important works including le testament donadieu le voyageur de la toussaint and le cercle des mahé he also conducted important correspondence most notably with andré gide also in the early s simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition a reminder of his father giving him only months to live it was also at this time that tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and boule he and tigy remained married until  but it was now a marriage in name only despite tigys initial protests boule remained with the family the ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding the city of la rochelle eventually honored simenon naming a quay after him in  simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony however in  his son johnny participated in another event honoring his father in the united states and canada –edit simenon escaped questioning

california simenon lived for a short time on anna maria island near bradenton florida before renting a house in nogales arizona where boule was finally reunited with him his novel the bottom of the bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in nogales although enchanted by the desert simenon decided to leave arizona and following a stay in california settled into a large house shadow rock farm in lakeville connecticut this town forms the background for his  novel la mort de belle the death of belle while in the united states simenon and his son marc learned to speak english with relative ease as did boule tigy however had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to europe in the meantime simenon had met denyse ouimet a woman seventeen years his junior denyse who was originally from montréal met simenon in new york city in  she was to be hired as a secretary and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship after resolving numerous legal difficulties simenon and tigy were divorced in  simenon and denyse ouimet were then married in reno nevada in  and eventually had three children johnny born in  mariejo born in  and pierre born in  in

a number of very shortterm odd jobs career beginningsedit in january  the yearold simenon took a job at the gazette de liège a newspaper edited by joseph demarteau while simenons own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city including politics bars and cheap hotels but also crime police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist edmond locard simenons experience at the gazette also taught him the art of quick editing he wrote more than  articles under the pen name g simcitation needed he began submitting stories to le matin in the early s simenons first novel au pont des arches was written in june  and published in  under his g sim pseudonym writing as monsieur le coq he also published more than  humorous pieces between november  and december citation needed he stopped writing for the gazette in december  during this period simenons familiarity with nightlife prostitutes drunkenness and carousing increased the people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists bohemian artists and even two future murderers the latter appearing in his novel les trois crimes de mes amis he also frequented a group of artists known as la caque while not really involved in the group he did meet his future wife régine renchon through it from  to  he used a total of  pen names while writing  novels and short stories in france –edit simenons father died in  and this served as the occasion for the author to move to paris with régine renchon hereafter referred to by her nickname tigy at first living in the th arrondissement not far from the boulevard des batignolles he became familiar with the city its bistros cheap hotels bars and restaurants more importantly he also came to know ordinary workingclass parisians writing under numerous pseudonyms he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends simenon and tigy returned briefly to liège in march  to marry despite his catholic upbringing simenon was not a believer tigy came from a thoroughly nonreligious family however simenons mother insisted on a church wedding forcing tigy to become a nominal convert learning the catholic churchs catechism despite their fathers lack of religious convictions all of simenons children would be baptized as catholics marriage to tigy however did not prevent simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women perhaps most famously josephine baker a reporting assignment had simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in  giving him a taste for boating in  he decided to have a boat built the ostrogoth simenon tigy their cook and housekeeper henriette liberge and their dog olaf lived on board the ostrogoth travelling the french canal system henriette liberge known as boule literally ball a reference to her slight pudginess was romantically involved with simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family really part of it maigret statue in delfzijl in  the most famous character invented by simenon commissaire maigret made his first appearance in a piece in detective written at joseph kessels request this first ever maigret detective story was written while boating in the netherlands particularly in and around the dutch town of delfzijl a statue of maigret in delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this  saw simenon travel extensively sending back reports from africa eastern europe turkey and the soviet union a trip around the world followed in  and  between  and  simenon tigy and boule lived at la richardière a thcentury manor house in marsilly at the charentemaritime département the house is evoked in simenons novel le testament donadieu at the beginning of  he rented the villa agnès in la rochelle and published la suspect and then in august purchased a farm house in nieulsurmer also in the charentemaritime where his and tigys only child marc was born in  simenon lived in the vendée during the second world war simenons conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the germans while others disagree viewing simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the gestapo suspected him of being jewish apparently conflating the names simenon and simon in any case simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with german studios during the occupation and in  was sentenced to a fiveyear period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work this sentence however was kept from the public and had little practical effect the war years did see simenon produce a number of important works including le testament donadieu le voyageur de la toussaint and le cercle des mahé he also conducted important correspondence most notably with andré gide also in the early s simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition a reminder of his father giving him only months to live it was also at this time that tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and boule he and tigy remained married until  but it was now a marriage in name only despite tigys initial protests boule remained with the family the ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding the city of la rochelle eventually honored simenon naming a quay after him in  simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony however in  his son johnny participated in another event honoring his father in the united states and

difficulties was initially unable to join them during the years he spent in the united states simenon regularly visited new york city he and his family also went on lengthy car trips traveling from maine to florida and then west as far as california simenon lived for a short time on anna maria island near bradenton florida before renting a house in nogales arizona where boule was finally reunited with him his novel the bottom of the bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in nogales although enchanted by the desert simenon decided to leave arizona and following a stay in california settled into a large house shadow rock farm in lakeville connecticut this town forms the background for his  novel la mort de belle the death of belle while in the united states simenon and his son marc learned to speak english with relative ease as did boule tigy however had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to europe in the meantime simenon had met denyse ouimet a woman seventeen years his junior denyse who was originally from montréal met simenon in new york city in  she was to be hired as a secretary and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy relationship after resolving numerous legal difficulties simenon and tigy were divorced in  simenon and denyse ouimet were then married in reno nevada in  and eventually had three children johnny born

a number of very shortterm odd jobs career beginningsedit in january  the yearold simenon took a job at the gazette de liège a newspaper edited by joseph demarteau while simenons own beat only covered unimportant human interest stories it afforded him an opportunity to explore the seamier side of the city including politics bars and cheap hotels but also crime police investigations and lectures on police technique by the criminologist edmond locard simenons experience at the gazette also taught him the art of quick editing he wrote more than  articles under the pen name g simcitation needed he began submitting stories to le matin in the early s simenons first novel au pont des arches was written in june  and published in  under his g sim pseudonym writing as monsieur le coq he also published more than  humorous pieces between november  and december citation needed he stopped writing for the gazette in december  during this period simenons familiarity with nightlife prostitutes drunkenness and carousing increased the people he rubbed elbows with included anarchists bohemian artists and even two future murderers the latter appearing in his novel les trois crimes de mes amis he also frequented a group of artists known as la caque while not really involved in the group he did meet his future wife régine renchon through it from  to  he used a total of  pen names while writing  novels and short stories in france –edit simenons father died in  and this served as the occasion for the author to move to paris with régine renchon hereafter referred to by her nickname tigy at first living in the th arrondissement not far from the boulevard des batignolles he became familiar with the city its bistros cheap hotels bars and restaurants more importantly he also came to know ordinary workingclass parisians writing under numerous pseudonyms he found his creativity beginning to pay financial dividends simenon and tigy returned briefly to liège in march  to marry despite his catholic upbringing simenon was not a believer tigy came from a thoroughly nonreligious family however simenons mother insisted on a church wedding forcing tigy to become a nominal convert learning the catholic churchs catechism despite their fathers lack of religious convictions all of simenons children would be baptized as catholics marriage to tigy however did not prevent simenon from having liaisons with numerous other women perhaps most famously josephine baker a reporting assignment had simenon on a lengthy sea voyage in  giving him a taste for boating in  he decided to have a boat built the ostrogoth simenon tigy their cook and housekeeper henriette liberge and their dog olaf lived on board the ostrogoth travelling the french canal system henriette liberge known as boule literally ball a reference to her slight pudginess was romantically involved with simenon for the next several decades and would remain a close friend of the family really part of it maigret statue in delfzijl in  the most famous character invented by simenon commissaire maigret made his first appearance in a piece in detective written at joseph kessels request this first ever maigret detective story was written while boating in the netherlands particularly in and around the dutch town of delfzijl a statue of maigret in delfzijl is a perpetual reminder of this  saw simenon travel extensively sending back reports from africa eastern europe turkey and the soviet union a trip around the world followed in  and  between  and  simenon tigy and boule lived at la richardière a

published la suspect and then in august purchased a farm house in nieulsurmer also in the charentemaritime where his and tigys only child marc was born in  simenon lived in the vendée during the second world war simenons conduct during the war is a matter of considerable controversy with some scholars inclined to view him as having been a collaborator with the germans while others disagree viewing simenon as having been an apolitical man who was essentially an opportunist but by no means a collaborator further confusion stems from the fact that he was denounced as a collaborator by local farmers while at the same time the gestapo suspected him of being jewish apparently conflating the names simenon and simon in any case simenon was under investigation at the end of the war because he had negotiated film rights of his books with german studios during the occupation and in  was sentenced to a fiveyear period during which he was forbidden to publish any new work this sentence however was kept from the public and had little practical effect the war years did see simenon produce a number of important works including le testament donadieu le voyageur de la toussaint and le cercle des mahé he also conducted important correspondence most notably with andré gide also in the early s simenon had a health scare when a local doctor misdiagnosed him with a serious heart condition a reminder of his father giving him only months to live it was also at this time that tigy finally realized the nature of the relationship between her husband and boule he and tigy remained married until  but it was now a marriage in name only despite tigys initial protests boule remained with the family the ambiguities of the war years notwithstanding the city of la rochelle eventually honored simenon naming a quay after him in  simenon was too ill to attend the dedication ceremony however in  his son johnny participated in another event honoring his father in the united states and

maine to florida and then west as far as california simenon lived for a short time on anna maria island near bradenton florida before renting a house in nogales arizona where boule was finally reunited with him his novel the bottom of the bottle was heavily influenced by his stay in nogales although enchanted by the desert simenon decided to leave arizona and following a stay in california settled into a large house shadow rock farm in lakeville connecticut this town forms the background for his  novel la mort de belle the death of belle while in the united states simenon and his son marc learned to speak english with relative ease as did boule tigy however had a great deal of trouble with the language and pined for a return to europe in the meantime simenon had met denyse ouimet a woman seventeen years his junior denyse who was originally from montréal met simenon in new york city in  she was to be hired as a secretary and they promptly began an often stormy and unhappy

theresa marquez director of marketing jim wedeberg dairy pool coordinator pam saunders meat pool coordinator and robert koch produce marketing coordinator goal secure stable profitable prices for smallscale producers through development of new markets for organic dairy vegetable and meat products date established february  area served united states number of members  key challenges cash flow and equity financing helpful resources national farmers organization cooperative development services wisconsin center for cooperatives wisconsin center for dairy research usda rural development division during the farm financial crisis of the late s producers responded to depressed commodity prices and federal program changes with a range of solutions some farmers organized a call for enhanced government assistance while others quietly tried to survive by taking offfarm employment elsewhere in wisconsins coulee region  farmers conceived of a pooled marketing cooperative that could promote sales of premium organic products and secure stable prices for its members this group of farmers formed the coulee region organic produce pool cropp in february  and is now the largest farmerowned organic cooperative in north america shipping organic dairy beef poultry vegetable pork and egg products across the country under its organic valley label why market collaboratively  identifying a need and an opportunity throughout the s many producers in central wisconsins coulee region operated smallscale grain vegetable andor dairy farms that included one to three acres of tobacco as a cash crop when federal programs and prices began to collapse for these and other commodities many of the areas producers started thinking about a different way to farm and market a lot of the upper midwests small family farmers were on the verge of going out of business explains cropp marketing director theresa marquez as a last resort some farmers turned to niche marketing which in their case meant organic sales according to marquez many of cropps early founders were already farming organically as a way to save money on inputs prior to the coops formation after investigating organic production requirements a lot of farmers realized that they qualified for organic certification says marquez in early fall   wisconsin farmers many of whom were producing tobacco and vegetables began talking seriously about the creation of an organic vegetable and dairy marketing cooperative the idea for a cooperative structure stemmed from tobacco growers experience with the northern wisconsin tobacco cooperative which pooled tobacco for collective sales the primary goal of the cooperative was to establish and secure a stable target price for members regardless of commodities produced a target price is different from a premium explains cropps meat pool coordinator pam saunders a target price is not tied to conventional prices in any way so that it does not fluctuate with that market target prices are just that  price goals established to pay the producer for hisher costs of production plus a profit coupled with profitable pricing goals was the need to build price stability price stability is very important for farm survival says saunders farmers need to be able to plan around a price it enables a farmer to make sound production and marketing decisions a second but equally important goal of the proposed cooperative was to create a marketing arm that could develop sales arrange processing and distribute products the group envisioned hiring staff who could market products on members behalf farmers saw the coop as a bridge between the producer and the consumer says cropp cooperative pool manager jim wedeberg with these goals firmly in mind a small steering committee was organized to explore  consumer demand for organic vegetables and milk  processing feasibility  financing options and  distribution alternatives exploration of an idea dairy pricing and supply management a target price of  per hundredweight was established for fluid milk when cropp began operations in  targets were also set for eggs and meat production quotas similar to those instituted under the federal tobacco programs combined with a last on first off principle and alternative pricing incentives were proposed to manage target prices under this system farm member production quotas were established based on equity contributions these quotas remained fixed according to plans however the last member to join a milk route was the first one removed from cropps milk pickup list as a way to manage prices during surplus supply periods likewise members who remained on the milk pickup route were required to produce within their quota individual delivery quota rights based on the amount of equity contributed by each member are observed through a price incentive system target prices were and continue to be paid for all milk shipped within quota milk shipped over quota is subject to conventional pricing although saunders says that approximately  percent of all milk sold to cropp cooperative is distributed as organic steering committee members conducted preliminary informal market research to investigate retail demand for locally produced organic vegetables fluid milk and valueadded dairy products the group really didnt have much money available for marketing research in the beginning says marquez it was also hard to develop consumer demand projections in the organic market at that time since there were no precedents particularly for dairy products working within their budgets steering committee members contacted natural foods stores in madison and chicago to inquire about demand for a range of fresh organic vegetables and dairy products a formal prospectus stating the groups mission planting intentions and future product availability was mailed to retailers and followed up with a phone call although retailers response was better than expected buyers were unwilling to sign purchase contracts until vegetables and other products were actually available so we moved ahead with our plans despite no firm commitments from retailers recalls cropp ceo and founding member george seimon we could have spent another year on business planning product development and grower trainings but we decided to move forward because of the tremendous amount of enthusiasm brewing out in the fields with little to lose at that time farmers wanted to move ahead with the cooperative with potential markets identified the group next made phone calls to local vegetable distributors to get a feel for wholesale prices warehouse storage availability and transportation expenses at the same time the group consulted with another local distributor called north farm cooperative which had already established a market for natural cheese the distributor was interested in selling organic cheese and therefore agreed to package and market all the organic cheddar cheese that cropp could produce soon after their conversations with north farm cooperative steering committee members contacted nearby processors with expertise in cheddar production to discuss production requirements and processing capacity lastly the steering committee explored financing options with a local bank in wisconsin to discuss cashflow and equity needs before filing as a cooperative challenges from the start cropp cooperative anticipated two financerelated challenges that would limit its longterm success cashflow constraints and the need for plant capacity to process and package dairy products like most businesses that process a product we faced a long turnaround time between raw commodity pick up from farm members and payment from the retailer after product delivery explains saunders this expected cashflow problem was addressed first on paper and then in practice through an equitybuilding strategy and a partnership agreement with the national farmers organization nfo according to cropps financing and membership plan new members are required to contribute the equivalent of one months worth of production in the form of a certificate of deposit cd at a local bank the cd owned jointly by the farmer and the cooperative is pledged as an equity guarantee against loans issued to finance cash flow this base equity has enabled cropp to manage its cash flow effectively says saunders moreover an agreement forged with nfo enabled cropp to reserve its base equity for marketing efforts rather than financing infrastructure and logistics nfo agreed to organize an organic milk program within its existing fluid milk pooled delivery and sales program whereby cropps paperwork and transportation logistics were handled internally by nfo as for the groups processing and packaging needs saunders says cropp cooperative has become a specialist at establishing relationships with existing meat dairy and egg processors cropp founders decided not to rush into brick and mortar purchases saunders explains a lot of time was and is devoted to the development of relationships with local processors copack agreements were signed with plant owners under which cropp managed organic production within existing processing facilities cropp cooperative now works with  different processors across the country to process and package dairy meat and egg products the success of cropp cooperatives processing relationships is also related to industry consolidation saunders explains that many small and mediumsized processors were left without customers following farm foreclosures in the late s and largescale processor consolidation in more recent years many of the plants particularly butter and cheese processors were eager for customers says saunders the meatpacking plants have become more interested in working with us now that the usda has approved an organic meat label all processing facilities under contract with cropp cooperative are certified organic and subject to quality standards set by cropp begin operations based on positive feedback from natural foods stores an equity financing plan from their bank and processing agreements steering committee members agreed to formally launch cropp cooperative in february  the first organic pooled marketing group in the country shortly after forming as a cooperative cropp recruited new members through local newspaper ads and town meetings in total  farm families joined the cooperative most of them smallscale dairies or diversified vegetable and tobacco farmers within one year of formation cropps members produced the countrys first organic cheese for sale in retail markets primarily natural foods stores in the cities of madison wisconsin and chicago next thanks to a grant from the state of wisconsin cropp hired a green bay marketing firm to develop and design a label for its dairy products cropp cooperative launched its organic valley label in  at the same time using member equity cropp purchased an abandoned creamery in central wisconsin to serve as an office for its six employees and warehouse storage for its products processing and distribution were contracted locally member recruitment responsibilities and benefits the reisgrafs story jeff and pam reisgraf are typical of many cropp members they own and operate a head organic dairy farm in jordan minnesota and market their milk through cropp cooperative every month prior to joining cropp the reisgrafs farmed organically but sold their milk through conventional markets we werent being paid for organic milk says jeff and when we sold our milk in conventional markets prices bounced around a lot thats the difference with cropp and what i like best about the coop we are able to get a higher stable price for our milk cropps philosophy of working with smallscale family farms is also important to the reisgrafs they understand our goals and our needs as a family operation says pam and they incorporate family farming into their advertising i like this because it helps educate the public about who we are in  when joining cropp the reisgrafs contributed a total of  in the form of a cd our contribution was based on herd size and monthly milk production explains pam we also pay a cwt checkoff with each milk delivery to cover coop transportation and marketing expenses in addition to their financial investments the reisgrafs feel strongly about giving time to the cooperative by attending annual and monthly dairy pool meetings when possible and getting involved in cropps marketing and management decisions wed actually like to get more involved says jeff but we cant always take the time to get to the meetings in wisconsin as a tradeoff the reisgrafs are in constant contact with their dairy executive committee pool representative who distributes meeting minutes and other updates to ensure members are informed and have a chance to be involved jeff and pam riesgraf with their children left to right kelby derek and rachel cropp cooperatives original  members have grown to nearly  members over the past  years most members are small and midsized family farmers scattered across  states including minnesota members are divided into commodity pool groups such as the dairy pool vegetable pool and meat pool pools elect a representative and meet once per month to review cropp policies marketing strategies and other issues seventy percent of cropp members belong to the dairy pool member herd sizes range from  to  cows although the average pool member herd size is  cows according to wedeberg the remaining  percent of cropps growing membership produce organic vegetables eggs and meat the cooperative is constantly recruiting new members particularly vegetable growers as pool members prepare to launch a new line of valueadded frozen potato sweet corn green bean and pea products upon joining the cooperative dairy farmers are required to contribute the financial equivalent of approximately one months worth of production to cropp cooperative in the form of a cd a formula equal to cwt times the members average monthly milk production is used to calculate the cd investment vegetable growers on the other hand make a onetime cd investment equal to five percent of annual sales cd contributions can be financed over a number of months by paying a portion of each delivery to the cooperative upon leaving the cooperative the cd is cashed out to the individual farm member since  dairy members have been charged an additional fee equal to cwt to cover product inventory maintenance costs and other expenses according to wedeberg likewise vegetable growers pay an annual fee equal to one percent of gross sales to help cover the coops variable operating expenses in return for their financial support cropp cooperative members have gained control over their products from farm gate to the retail store as well as the opportunity to add value to their products and secure stable prices under a nationally recognized brand name collaborative marketing has also allowed members to focus on farming rather than sales storage and transportation management says koch by pooling equity contributions farm members gain access to capital equipment and marketing expertise for minor individual investments it doesnt make sense for a vegetable grower for example who sells  worth of product each year to invest  in infrastructure  like walkin coolers fork lifts and icepacking machines explains koch the cooperative structure allows farmers to grow their operation slowly according to their goals and risk little on capital investments cropp also provides members with technical assistance and access to relatively scarce inputs for example vegetable pool coordinator mark shepherd works fulltime to answer growers questions about seeds planting dates and pests likewise dairy producers can obtain highly demanded organic feed via cropps online organic trader site the site is organized as an advertising space where buyers and sellers of organic feed can exchange information about supply availability and demand this is an important service says saunders organic feed is a critical input for most of our members who produce livestock and milk marketing and management strategy prior to  when a fulltime sales force was hired cooperative members conducted their own marketing and were able to limit marketing investments because they had no competition according to marquez cropp founders had successfully identified a niche market for organic butter and cheese when starting out cropp was the only producer of organic butter and cheese during its startup years says marquez but it wasnt long before things changed and cropp found itself competing for sales with other organic processors as cropps competition grew the cooperative was forced to adapt its marketing strategy fifteen fulltime brokers and regional marketing managers were hired in  to place products open new accounts and plan promotions our marketing strategy continues to change and adapt says marquez competition customer demand and our own growth has made it necessary to remain flexible at all times in addition to flexibility cropps marketing and management strategy is built around a second component  diversity cropp marketing staff are dedicated to the promotion of two general product lines that target different customer markets  retail products such as the organic valley line and fresh produce and  processor ingredient products the coop offers a diverse line of products that enable us to target different markets says marquez for example by producing an ingredient line such as egg white powder and grated cheese for entrees cropp is able to target processor markets whereas our brandname products open the door to retail sales these two product categories are just one element of cropps diversified marketing strategy cropp also directs its marketing efforts at different types of retailers wholesalers and processors we work with them all  chain supermarkets small natural foods stores and startup processors marquez explains by marketing to a diverse customer base the cooperative limits its risk and exposure to market failure if one market collapses we always have another market to turn to explains marquez product diversity is also a tool for utilizing byproducts and coping with fluctuations in customer demand skim milk for example a byproduct of butter production is used to produce a range of ingredient products so that more value is added to member commodities likewise the mix of highly perishable fluid products and hard products gives cropp a little more flexibility to adjust inventories based on changes in retail and processor demand if demand for fluid milk begins to wane as a result of seasonal or other factors explains marquez cropp can turn its fluid milk into hard product like cheese which is more storable the last element of marketing diversity and flexibility involves membership distribution cropp believes that it is important to spread its membership base across the country a diverse membership base enables cropp to build new markets more efficiently and to ensure commodity supplies during periods of county state or regional natural disaster as cropp begins to develop new markets for example it can supplement sales with products from other parts of the country if necessary to ensure supplies once we have a new market secured cropp can then recruit new members in that area to locally supply market demand says marquez current operations after  years of collaboration market development member recruitment and equity building cropp cooperative is booming projected revenues will total  million in  it is successfully generating stable profits for farm members building new markets for highquality products creating new jobs for  rural residents and promoting environmental stewardship in recognition of its success cropp cooperative was ranked wisconsins number one rural development initiative among  by the states governor in  products which have expanded from vegetables and milk to meat and eggs are distributed under the organic valley label to customers in all  states although dairy products remain cropps top achievement cropp cooperative was recognized with firstplace quality and taste awards in  and  by the american cheese society for its organic valley cheddar cheese and organic valley cultured butter respectively most recently in  cropp cooperative purchased its first processing plant which will be used to manufacture organic cultured and salted butter organic milk powder and to reload organic fluid milk into tankers for further distribution the  million investment will allow cropp to keep up with its rapid growth in market demand for organic dairy products and to build longterm assets cropp had been preparing for this opportunity over the past  years says saunders when the plant became available coop members agreed they were financially and organizationally ready for this type of investment the plant located in chaseburg wisconsin employs six people and produces  pounds of butter monthly most importantly cropp cooperative has achieved its original target price goals the cooperative reached its initial target price of cwt in  soon after with a member vote the target price was increased to cwt though actual prices paid to producers in  equaled cwt minus fees over the life of the cooperative wedeberg says dairy members have been paid on average  to cwt above conventional fluid milk prices likewise as conventional milk prices fluctuated wildly wedeberg explains that cropps target price for fluid milk has remained stable conventional prices will occasionally spike to levels near our target price he says but it doesnt take long for the conventional market to plummet whereas the cropp target price remains stable partnership and assistance cropp has worked closely with dozens of state agencies banks and nonprofit organizations nationwide to build markets for topquality organic products and create a successful business for its members in addition to nfo and a local wisconsin lender cropp members consulted with cooperative development services and the wisconsin center for cooperatives over the past  years to conduct board training sessions the cooperative has also worked with usda rural development in washington dc the wisconsin agriculture development and diversification grant program as well as the wisconsin center for dairy research who provided technical expertise on issues such as business development and milk production weve utilized most resources that are out there says seimon but we never became heavily dependent on outside help words of advice looking back over his  years of experience with the cooperative and as a dairy farmer in central wisconsin wedeberg says that the success of cropp has been its ability to involve consumers and farm members in marketing and management decisions we have worked hard to build the link between farmer and consumer says wedeberg and as the cooperative has grown weve made every effort to ensure that producers remain active in marketing their products consumer feedback is an important part of the cropp cooperative philosophy a tollfree number is provided on all product packaging to encourage customer comments a website inviting questions and comments was recently launched according to wedeberg cropp receives calls and internet inquiries about a number of topics including product ingredients animal welfare and family farm issues these are valuable tools for us to assess consumer needs and concerns says wedeberg it is a direct way for consumers to give us suggestions comments and criticism as a marketing coop we want to respond to the needs of our customers and this type of direct marketing is a great way to stay in touch with these needs cropp cooperative also conducts periodic surveys of its retail buyers to learn more about customer preference and retailer needs marketing information obtained from direct customer feedback and retail surveys is always carried directly to cropp cooperative members producer pools meet with marketing staff and executive committee representatives once every month to discuss the creation of new products changes in organic certification standards prices and supply needs we tried to design cropp from the beginning as a bottomup business says wedeberg we know that the cooperative will do well if we stay informed work together and make sure that individual members and consumers needs are being met december  update with new changes to regulations governing the organic certification of meat in place cropp launched a new line of organic meat in september and october of  their meat products are marketed under the label valleys family of farms as saunders explains the usdas allowance of the word organic on meat labels is very narrow precluding any use of the word organic on the label other than in the phrase certified organic by certifying entity this means that we are still unable to use our registered brand nametrademark organic valley on our meat products cropp now has a beef a hog and a poultry pool and has  beef pork and poultry frozen retail products in national distribution in addition to a limited regional fresh beef program some major changes have taken place in cropps farmer investment all the cds are being converted to shares of preferred stock as of december   the preferred shares are owned only by producers are issued in an amount equivalent to approximately  percent of expected annual gross sales by that producer for any of the pools and carry voting privileges however there is still only one vote per member according to saunders this means that the farmer investment instead of sitting in the bank as collateral for borrowing is now part of the cash flow equation in addition individuals including but not limited to producer members and employees may invest in the cooperative by buying class b stock at  per share and  percent interest the class b shares do not carrying voting privileges all the pools will convert to this stock scenario according to saunders cropp will have close to  million in sales in the year  next  table of contents introduction

minnesota all rights reserved the university of minnesota is an equal opportunity educator and employer privacy operating cost lawaspectcom search for search operating cost it seems that legislation is proving to be ineffective in relieving smaller farmers from their plight because of market forces the increase in operating cost takes its toll on farmers and no amount of subsidy is going to counteract or manage to dent market forces but there is something into what murphy points to as the entrepreneurial spirit in an interview with george simon year old ceo of a farming cooperative he relates the success story of likeminded farmers murphy  the cooperative formed in  and has devoted itself to growing organic pesticidefree produce and has grown since in  the cooperative of  families nationwide posted  million in revenues and has managed to nudge this up to a whopping  million in  obviously there is a demand for their products and the market according to murphy has grown considerably for the past years george simeon relates that today’s farmers are college educated and swelling with entrepreneurial spirit the interview proceeds to relate that the cooperative’s business model makes it so that they have practically escaped and remain unscathed by the boomandbust cycle that plagues so many other farmers and make them susceptible and in need of government intervention the business model further capitalizes on the want and need of consumers for naturally grown food which they pay a premium to get the business cycle is thrown out of the equation as the cooperative has power to control prices as compared to farmers who have to take whatever price the market can give them for runofthemill produce the idea of growing organic food is catering to a niche and producing specialized food stuffs as compared to the typical model of making more of the same in other studies other business models were identified schilling et al study shows the viability of agrotourism in the study it was found that  of farmers surveyed found that developing agrotourism was very important insofar as revenue opportunities are concerned schilling  the  study further found that about  of farms derived  or more of their income from agrotourism and that offering such a product is part of the diversification program that many farms are now focusing on this stands to reason as diversifying the sources of income reduces the risk of following as george simeon would call the boomandbust cycle the business model is not limited to offering guided informational and sightseeing tours – the model also allows for the farm to peddle and market its “homegrown” products to visitors moreover with respect to the right to farm act agrotourism affords farming communities the chance to reintroduce farming to individuals less familiar with its practices i e a from of relationship building that minimizes friction with the urban sprawl sweeping across traditionally agricultural states  farms develop such relationship building through planned fun activities for visitors – almost calling forth an image of having a backyard amusement park and very much similar to places such as knott’s berry farm the two business models mentioned above have innovation in common in man’s beginning’s agriculture was a way of life for nearly all of the community that majority was involved in the act of growing and supplying food is typified in the number of individuals engaged in farming the early part of the th century in more recent times technology has made farming much easier and more efficient and fewer individuals need devote their time to produce so much more the modern economy in some ways is unforgiving so much so that legislation can only do so much – as with farmer smith a mere existence and solvency until the next harvest but as doors are closing for the agricultural sector new ones open in the form of more sophisticated business models it appears that legislation is not at fault or not entirely at fault and perhaps president bush’s move to cap subsidies is far shrewder than it seems as eventually drying out subsidies brings out the entrepreneurial spirit in the global markets there is also a call to end the united state’s subsidies on agricultural products in the doha round talks held in geneva india pulled away from negotiations with the u s as the u s refused to lower farm subsidies and further asked that developing nations pull down trade barriers but because the u s can supply crops so cheaply to world markets particularly with the subsidies in place many farmers from india are losing their market thakurta what’s more is that thakurta’s report details that some  farmers in rural india commit suicide each year because the e u and u s are distorting world prices with farm subsidies even in jamaica the effect of farming subsidies is made apparent while the u s seeks to promote free trade and developing nations lower tariffs and trade barriers the subsidies flood the markets of developing nations with cheaper crops – crops heavily subsidized by the national government cassel welfare farming thus far shows that it is ineffective in combating the devastating effects of the boomandbust cycles that the agricultural sector faces and that such subsidies perpetuate the cycle by being probig business subsidies encourage over production which constitutes excessive supply and consequently further reduces market prices for subsidized crops while government is forced to dole out more to cover the guaranteed prices the implications of the subsidies are not limited to the local context and affect individuals and communities as far as rural india and jamaica the research has put forth some business models as outlined by other studies and government programs should be more attuned to promoting such measures as opposed to direct monetary assistance cassel andrew “why u s farm subsidies are bad for the world ” may    mar  httpwww

investigators home band video medien kontakt band george simeon s vocals   george simeon s was born a while ago into a bitterly poor family in the village of styllos northwest of famagusta northern cyprus – when northern cyprus was not yet turkish george and his  sisters and brothers never went to school since there was no money in the house although he could neither read nor write  and still can’t  he managed to open a porn shop at the age of  unfortunately he was ahead of his time and there was not yet a demand for porn products in styllos so he became a priest serving the church of the holy kolokasi there he started to sing the holy songs of cyprus vegetables on a regular basis and was heard doing so by a strange man from abroad named malcom the eejit it was his idea to combine george’s early pornoshopplan with an new kind of music the sex pissers were born since george simeon s‘s voice was too good and too unusual for the simple sexpisserssongs and since george didn’t want to give up singing about kologasi he joined the famous punk rock band the investigators an outstanding group of vegetables that’s the simple story about one of the most impressive singers the village of styllos ever produced keep on punk rocking band membersgeorge simeon s – vocals fjodor f fjodor – bass vincent d wit – guitar reiner gamma – drums
