diagnosed cancer patients even including pancreatic cancer and liver cancer how could it be that successful the kelley enzymes strip the unique protein coating off of cancer cells so the immune system can identify and kill the cancer cells dr kelley and his practitioners treated more  patients claiming a  percent success rate for those who came to him first — not after chemotherapy radiation or surgery for those with a predicted life expectancy of about three months he said that a welldesigned nutritional program would yield “slightly better than a  chance of survival” for those with a very advanced disease given less than three months to live he claimed a success rate between  and  percent dr kelley talked of the pancreas as being one of the main organs in defense of cancer why would he say that the pancreas works with the liver to regulate insulin a hormone and it produces many enzymes more than  and some of them dissolve protein such as those on the outside of cancer cells dr kelley learned this perspective from the famous embryologist john beard who worked at the university of edinburgh at the turn of the th century he first proposed in  that pancreatic proteolytic enzymes in addition to their wellknown digestive function represent the body’s main defense against cancer dr kelley and beard before him believed to defeat cancer you don’t create some new method of defense that does not mimic the human body you create a method of defense that acts like the human body and the body uses pancreatic proteolytic enzymes in the natural fight against cancer what makes enzymes function well in the body are trace minerals and hormone balance so dr kelley provided support for both in his program dr kelley always said you have to bring the body back to homeostasis that does not entail large dosages of strange items being put into the body what does he mean by that highdose vitamin c can disrupt enzyme function that is why dr kelley did not use high dose vitamin c he did believe the body needed plant enzyme function so he endorsed and recommended highdose juicing of specific vegetable combinations and he worked to rebuild the glandular function of the body with glandular supplements until the body could provide its own glandular support dr kelley saw a close correlation between diabetes and cancer and treated both in a similar fashion anyone who came to dr kelley with cancer often had diabetes and both were cured with his program dr kelley believed you had to detox very aggressively he believed you could not aggressively kill cancer cells in a body already full of toxins or you contributed to a state of cachexia so part of his program was an aggressive detox program done in sequence very carefully he said you should wait six months before doing a gallbladder flush or you may put a patient into a healing crisis they cannot handle important warning the kelley protocol is not just taking enzymes but is a complete program that evaluates all aspects of a person with metastatic disease like cancer it should be combined with a major cancer treatment generally the cellectbudwig protocol there are two vendors of the enzymes study both websites and pick one remember vendors cannot make medical claims vendor no  and consultant of the kelley enzymes knows which ones to use and how to incorporate the enzymes without risk dr kelley enzymes dale maxwell vendor no  is wade lightheart who has written a book on enzymes and sells the enzymes mvpmaximum viral power wade lightheart interview with ty bollinger and wade lightheart why would it be important to combine the enzymes with the cellectbudwig protocol it should be clearly understood that the  percent cure rate of dr kelley was on cancer patients who were newly diagnosed typically the cure rate on cancer patients who have had significant chemotherapy radiation andor surgery is only half of the cure rate for newly diagnosed cancer patients that is why the kelley protocol must be part of a complete protocol if you cannot afford the enzymes and the cellectbudwig then use the enzymes with the dirt cheap protocol  ‘one man alone dr nicholas gonzalezs book one man alone covers many of the worst stage iv cancer patients dr kelley helped cure with his program the five years of study of the dr kelley program convinced dr gonzalez to follow the lead of dr kelley who died on jan   his metabolic nutrition group is still active however dr gonzalez received his medical degree from cornell university medical college in  during a post graduate immunology fellowship under dr robert a good considered the father of immunology he completed a research study evaluating an aggressive nutritional therapy in the treatment of advanced cancer in private practice in new york city from  dr gonzalez treated patients diagnosed with cancer and other serious degenerative illnesses his gonzalez protocol is based on the belief that pancreatic enzymes are the bodys main defense against cancer and can be used as a treatment dr gonzalezs nutritional research received substantial financial support from proctor and gamble and nestlé results from a pilot study published in  described the most positive data in the medical literature for pancreatic cancer he died july   dr gonzalez website summary comments dr kelley and the current kelleytrained doctors are fond of saying “if you have the will to live the faith to survive and the intelligence to think on your own you have a good chance of survival with the kelley program healing is not for the weak of heart or those with a lack of faith” life clinic kelley protocol in hong kong is a fullservice clinic specializing in kelley site comments one answer to cancer dr kelleys classic book product and information –
