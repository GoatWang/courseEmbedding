christian and muslims fears that israel wants it for their own religious and national purposes are unfortunately well grounded tel aviv wants to wrest control of it back for israel because in jewish religious traditions the building of the rd temple will herald the beginning of the messianic age israeli prime minister knew that the optics of the metal detectors and forbidding anyone under  to worship at al aqsa would be horrific but in his characteristic hubris he just didnt give a damn through these actions he may well have lit the flames for yet another intifada then he will use this violence as the justification to tighten down the screws against palestinians even more than they are already i weep for all those dead and wounded jewish muslim and christian and those who will die and be wounded on all sides this is an absolute tragedy which could have been averted a violent response to these strictures for worshiping at al aqsa was precisely the outcome netanyahu and the
