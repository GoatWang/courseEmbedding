to  birgeneau appointed shirley neuman as vice president and provost chief academic officer in july  but she resigned on february   after just  months on the post it was reported that neuman’s headstrong approach alienated her from colleagues and students and there were also tensions between birgeneau and herself he left the university of toronto after only four years of his term despite the fact that his fiveyear term had been extended to seven years on his own request causing a flurry of controversy with his abrupt departure uc berkeleyedit he was recommended to the uc board of regents by robert dynes then president of the uc system and a former colleague of birgeneau when both worked at att bell laboratories birgeneau has used his platform as chancellor to make contributions to several political debates on june   birgeneau joined the president of columbia university in condemning britains university and college union for boycotting israeli academics and academic institutions and insisting that any boycott include their universities citing the likely threat to californias academic competitiveness if proposition  were passed birgeneau urged the uc berkeley community to vote against a  state ballot measure which would eliminate the right of gays and lesbians to marry during the  academic year he sent campus wide messages in support of the california dream act which allows undocumented students to qualify for financial aid the reform of proposition  which would close corporate property tax loopholes passed by voters in the late s and reallocate that funding to social services including higher education and the repeal of proposition  which would reenact affirmative action and significantly increase diversity in the nations public higher education institutions also during the  academic year birgeneau unveiled berkeley mcap the middle class access plan a new financial aid model that caps the total annual cost of an eligible students education  from tuition and fees to expenses including room board and books  at  percent of the familys total income families with incomes from  to  and assets typical of that range are eligible for the program which will provide grants beginning with the fall  semester while the ucwide blue and gold program aids lowerincome families this is the first program of its kind in the system to benefit the middle class it also served as impetus for the statewide middle class scholarship program announced by california assembly speaker john perez birgeneau was succeeded by nicholas

year and then spent one year at oxford university he was at bell laboratories from  to  and then went to mit in september  as professor of physics in  he became head of the department and in  became dean of science at mit in  he became president of the university of toronto in  he became uc berkeley’s chancellor and joined the physics faculty he concluded his service as chancellor at the end of may  and is now the arnold and barbara silverman distinguished professor of physics materials science and engineering and public policy professor birgeneau is the cochair of the lincoln project with mary sue coleman the president emeritus of the university of michigan the lincoln project is an initiative of the american academy of arts and sciences which advocates for the importance of public colleges and universities and devises strategies to increase their funding    research interestsprofessor birgeneaus research is primarily concerned with the phases and phase transition behavior of novel states of matter these include one and two dimensional quantum magnets highly disordered magnets lamellar cuo high temperature superconductors and fe pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors he uses primarily neutron and xray scattering techniques to probe these systems the neutron and xray scattering experiments are carried out at national facilities located in berkeley stanford maryland tennessee canada england germany and japan his group has also implemented stateoftheart materials growth and characterization facilities at lbl and on campus current projects the physics of highly correlated electronic materials is controlled by both quantum effects and many body electronelectron interactions this means that both the microscopic and macroscopic properties differ dramatically from those which one would deduce using traditional oneelectron techniques the most spectacular manifestation of quantum many body behavior is high temperature superconductivity which is found in a number of doped lamellar cuo ceramic materials we are pursuing a variety of strategies to elucidate the fundamental physics of high temperature superconductors with an emphasis on the interplay between microscopic antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and the superconductivity we are also studying related low dimensional magnetic systems in which quantum andor frustration effects produce behavior which is fundamentally different from that manifested by the equivalent classical system two decades after the discovery of the cuo high temperature superconductors quite unexpectedly an entirely new class of superconductors based on sheets of feas or fesete has been discovered  the phase diagrams of these new superconducting systems have many similarities to that of the copper oxide superconductors but there also are some essential differences for example the copper oxide parent materials are invariably antiferromagnetic mott insulators whereas for the febased materials the parent materials vary from being antiferromagnetic semimetals to antiferromagnetic narrow band gap semiconductors  in the fe systems the structural and magnetic transitions are intimately connected to each other whereas in the copper oxides the structural transition is benign  this new field is at the stage where materials discovery materials fabrication and characterization are playing the dominant role  accordingly our group is focused on growing large single crystals of fe pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors across the entire phase diagrams and characterizing the materials using bulk property measurements together with neutron and synchrotron xray scattering techniques as well as angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy   publicationsm wang w tian pn valdivia sx chi e

former university of california at berkeley chancellor robert j birgeneau john blaustein photo  uc berkeley website by susan snyder staff writer twitter icon ssnyderinq  mail icon ssnyderphillynewscom another commencement speaker has fallen to student protests robert j birgeneau former chancellor of the university of california berkeley has backed out of speaking at haverford college’s commencement scheduled for sunday following concerns expressed by haverford students and several professors over his leadership during a  incident when uc police used force on students protesting college costs haverford president daniel h weiss announced on tuesday morning that birgeneau has declined the college’s invitation to speak and receive an honorary degree birgeneau is known for his support of undocumented and minority students but became controversial when students as part of the occupy movement held nonviolent protests and were subject to force by university police “the board of managers campus colleagues and i express our appreciation for the views of those who were opposed to dr birgeneaus selection” weiss said in a letter to the campus community “it is nonetheless deeply regrettable that we have lost an opportunity to recognize and hear from one of the most consequential leaders in american higher education though we may not always agree with those in positions of leadership i believe that it is essential for us as members of an academic community to reaffirm our shared commitment to the respectful and mindful process by which we seek to learn through inquiry and intellectual engagement” it’s the second time this month that student protests have led to a speaker withdrawing condoleezza rice former secretary of state withdrew as rutgers university’s commencement speaker after faculty and students mounted a vigorous campaign citing her role in the iraq war picking commencement speakers has become increasingly divisive across the country last year swarthmore college’s speaker withdrew in the wake of a protest at haverford the controversy began after more than  students and three professors  all berkeley alums — wrote a letter to birgeneau urging him to meet nine conditions including publicly apologizing supporting reparations for the victims and writing a letter to haverford students explaining his position on the events and what you learned from them birgeneau declined in a short sharplyworded letter senior michael rushmore  a political science major from london said he would rather that birgeneau had met at least some of the conditions and appeared at commencement “given that he was unwilling to do any of that this is a minor victory in solidarity with the students at berkeley and i’ll take that” he said haverford already has three other commencement speakers so birgeneau will not be replaced said spokesman chris mills weiss met with students and other members of the haverford community last week in an effort to broker a resolution but none was reached “it was for me an illuminating and valuable conversation which regrettably did not include dr birgeneau” weiss said in the email “in offering congratulations to our students and their families dr birgeneau also expressed disappointment at not being able to increase awareness of what he believes to be the defining social justice issue of this generation of graduates the plight of  million undocumented american immigrants under dr birgeneaus leadership berkeley became the first public university in the united states to offer undocumented students comprehensive financial aid”   read more by susan snyder published may   —  am edt thanks for your continued support we recently asked you to support our journalism the response in a word is

firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
