landon thomas jr •  am wick simmons the former chief executive of prudential securities would have been proud the grand ballroom at the plaza hotel was chockfull of money managers nibbling away at their plates of filet mignon their attention focused on prudential securities star strategist ralph acampora who was delivering the keynote address the date was nov  a mere three weeks after mr simmons had without warning announced his retirement he was gone and his plan to spin off prudential securities from its parent company prudential insurance was apparently gone with him but mr simmons’ vision for a freestanding securities firmperhaps in partnership with lehman brotherswas almost tangible in that plaza ballroom it was the last day of a twoday hightech conference run by the firm’s newly formed technology division the prudential volpe technology group and in a starring role was mr simmons’ protégé mr acampora as mr simmons  had made mr acampora mr acampora  had helped to make prudential securities his bold call in  that the dow would hit  brought mr acampora a large dose of wall street fame burnishing as well the high hopes mr simmons had for his firm and now there mr acampora was doing his schtick plugging along in his mentor’s image pushing his new book and an idea that mr simmons had loved part henny youngman“hello is anyone out there what am i looking at an oil painting” he cracks when one of his many jokes falls a little flatand part a sophisticated reading of the market’s tea leaves mr acampora was there to boost confidence the message the tech boom and the peace dividend were just now kicking in stocks will be going higher this was it the very pith of mr simmons’ vision but no mr simmons mr simmons finally had run out of luck no one on the street was all that surprised when arthur ryan chief executive officer of the parent prudential insurance company accepted mr simmons’ resignation on oct  did mr simmons really think that tiny little pru could make a run at the big boys by riding the ralph acampora boomlet and snapping up the odd west coast tech boutique no way as far as mr ryan saw it prudential securities was all about retail distribution for its insurance products case closed and with prudential insurance’s giant ipo in the offing there could be little patience for the grand banking ambitions of hardwick simmons mr simmons is now retired and could not be reached for comment but allow him a little credit for giving it the old college try for the genial boston brahminhe is eighthgeneration harvard on the simmons side while on his mother’s side the stone family is about as oldline as boston families gethis year run on wall street had been a blessed one it goes something like this he started out at the semiwhiteshoe outfit hayden stone  co founded by his greatgrandfather in  in late  and subsequently moved on to cogan berlind weill  levitt in  when the family firm imploded and was bought out there he hitched his star to sandy weill and by the mid’s he found himself at shearsonfollowing its merger with cogan berlindrunning the retail brokerage unit in the late ’s shearson lehman brothers grew too big too fasta strategy supported by mr simmonsand had to be bailed out by parent american express shearson lehman brothers has since broken up into various entities reading the handwriting on the wall mr simmons resigned he landed lightly on his feet though this time as chief executive of prudential securities in  finally it seemed mr simmons was ready to step out on his own free from the shadows of great granddad hayden stone and sandy weill prudential was no picnic though when mr simmons took over there followed a litany of public relations disasters and between  and  prudential was forced to pay out a sum close to  billion in legal fees and settlements for disputed partnership claims not surprisingly the firm’s competitive position on wall street eroded through it all mr simmons sailed placidly along and in the late ’s began to push for the separation of prudential securities from its corporate parent prudential insurance quite simply mr simmons felt prudential securities was ready for prime time it was time for prudential to move into the bulge bracketto go headtohead with the likes of goldman sachs and morgan stanley dean witter he had his strong retail sales force and as it turned out he had mr acampora mr acampora is a roughhewn man with a broad friendly face who lacks the pretensions and gloss of many wall street talking heads his suits are off the rack and his ties tend to have pictures of buildings on them a product of the south bronx his father was a truck driver he is an iona college graduate who spent two years in the seminary studying for the priesthood before giving in to the stockmarket bug he started at the bottom in the early ’s studying technical analysis for a number of nowdefunct brokerage houses and then came “the call” in june  mr acamporaat the time the firm’s technical strategist and largely an unknown name on the streetstepped forward with the dow then around  and penned a nowfamous research report forecasting a  level for the dow by  “i lost a lot of sleep over that” mr acampora remembered sitting in his office surrounded by the blink and bleep of screens and monitors “i was getting a lot of criticism too ‘what are you smoking’ people were asking you have to remember that wall street was convinced at the time that we were headed into a bear market” when the dow burst through  in february  mr acampora was suddenly famous knowing it had a hot commodity on its hands the firm started flogging him “the  call was just the beginning” says rich franchella national sales manager for prudential “ralph became a media hero and we knew we had something so our marketing department said ‘let’s put ralph out there in a more public way let’s put him front and center for our clients” indeed mr acampora became ubiquitous a regular on cnbc and louis rukeyser’s wall street week  mr simmons was beside himself “ralph that was the best call i’ve ever heard” he said to mr acampora he also wanted to know “what can i do for you” “i was in detroit at the time” recalled mr acampora “wick said ‘i’d like to get you a gift anything’ so jokingly i said ‘how about a red  corvette” a month later there it was wrapped up in a bow and parked outside the prudential offices in  “dow ” read the license plate mr acampora later changed the plate to “dow ” and now it reads “dow ”his latest forecast for the index so mr acampora became a star and business on the retail side boomed and what a thrill it was “cnbc was all over me” mr acampora enthused “they had already made abby cohen the queen of wall street now i was going to be the king” recently he wrote a book the fourth megamarket now through  how three earlier bull markets explain the present and predict the future  mr simmons had pushed him to write it the firm was aggressively marketing it nationwide sending the indefatigable mr acampora out on multicity tours clients loved him the sales force loved him mr simmons loved him and of course prudential benefited up until  the pru name was suggestive of nothing more than lawsuits and fraud cases but would mr acampora’s leap from the other side of the tracks be enough to solidify mr simmons’ longstanding ambition to run a truly bigleague investment house worthy of the stone name mr simmons knew he needed to provide a competitive institutional service to institutional clients in that vein he branched out globally opening an office in shanghai and became acquisitive by buying a niche investment bank specializing in health care in june  last december mr simmons paid  million to buy volpe brown whelan  co a secondtier boutique investment bank in san francisco to sate his institutional clients’ ravenous demand for cuttingedge tech coverage it was a rich price and there had been a raft of highlevel defections from volpe since the deal’s close but a rump remained and prudential volpe technology group was born it was mr simmons’ boldest step to persuade his bosses at prudential insurance that the securities arm could go it alone and an even bolder plan was apparently in the works market scuttlebutt has it that mr simmons had been in talks with lehman brothers holdings inc about a possible merger earlier this year but the corporate parent was not ready to sell especially with mr acampora’s star so brightly ascendant in advance of its long awaited ipo the insurance company saw its securities arm as a prime outlet for all its many products why give it up now “prudential insurance was never going to fund hardwick simmons’ dream of creating a mini–morgan stanley” said an analyst who preferred to remain on background prudential’s ipo expected a year from now will be a very large one so analysts are loath to take their views public these days so once again mr simmons has fallen on his sword and since his resignation his successor john strangfeld has started undoing much of his predecessor’s work in late october  jobs were eliminated when the company’s institutional bond department was shuttered with more pruning expected in the coming weeks the goal is to focus the business entirely on the retail end so goodbye overpriced ibankers and hello ralph what does mr acampora think “look it’s a business” he says “wick wanted to make prudential competitive the other guy prudential insurance chief executive ryan said no am i upset no do i still admire him yes i have the highest regard for wick he took a firm that was in bad shape and made it respectable in the end he gave us enough rope to either climb up to the sky or hang ourselves” see also the john oliver
