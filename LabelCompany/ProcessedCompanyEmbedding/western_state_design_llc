williams esq and edward goldstein esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest protest challenging agencys award decision and evaluation of firms own proposal is denied where the record reflects that the selection decision and evaluation were consistent with the terms of the underlying solicitation decision western state design wsd of hayward california protests the award of a contract to g a braun inc braun of north syracuse new york under request for proposals rfp no varp issued by the department of veterans affairs va to furnish and install commercial laundry equipment at the va medical center in buffalo new york wsd generally challenges the agencys evaluation of its proposal and the selection of a higherpriced proposal for award we deny the protest on february   the agency issued the subject solicitation contemplating the award of a fixedprice contract to deliver and install laundry equipment described as a medium production folder cross folder with large piece stacker machine within  days of contract award id at   among other requirements the offered equipment had to be compatible with the existing laundry equipment had to be suitable for installation in the available space and had to include lockout and tagout devices id at  award was to be made to the offeror whose proposal was determined to be most advantageous to the government considering four evaluation factors  technical capability  price  qualitypast performance and  work plan id at  the solicitation advised that the individual factors are considered to be of equal importance therefore the nonprice factors of technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price id at  the va received timely proposals from wsd and braun proposals were evaluated under the technical capability factor using the following adjectival rating system which was not disclosed in the solicitation outstanding excellent acceptable marginal and unacceptable agency report ar exh  evaluation scoring sheets the past performance evaluation contemplated a risk assessment of very low risk low risk moderate risk high risk or neutral risk id after completing an initial evaluation the va held discussions with each offeror wsd and braun submitted revised proposals and the agency completed its evaluation in the final consensus evaluation the agency rated wsds proposal as marginal overall with marginal ratings for the technical capability and work plan factors as well as a very low performance risk rating for the past performance factor the marginal ratings resulted from wsds failure to adequately address several solicitation requirements as it relates to the protest the agency found that wsd failed to establish how its equipment would be compatible with the existing braun laundry equipment ar exh  evaluation scoring sheets at  exh  source selection decision at  brauns proposal was rated satisfactory overall and like wsd received a very low performance risk rating under the past performance factor with regard to price wsds proposal was low with a total price of  whereas brauns price was  ar exh  source selection decision at  the agency concluded that brauns higherrated higherpriced proposal constituted the best value and selected braun for award id at  after receiving a debriefing wsd filed this protest wsd argues that the agencys selection decision and evaluation of its proposal were improper according to wsd because the solicitation did not specify the weights to be attributed the evaluation factors there is no clear acquisition mechanism to determine that brauns higherpriced proposal offers the best value to the government protest at  protesters comments at  wsd also challenges the agencys finding that its proposal failed to establish the compatibility of its equipment with the existing braun equipment first wsds suggestion that the agencys selection decision was illusory because the rfp failed to establish the weight to be given each factor is factually erroneous and therefore without merit as described above the rfp specifically established that the evaluation factors were equallyweighted and that the technical capability and past performance factors when combined were significantly more important than price for the purpose of making a best value decision rfp at  second wsds challenge of the agencys technical evaluation is also without merit in reviewing a protest against the propriety of an evaluation it is not our role to independently evaluate proposals and substitute our judgment for that of the contracting activity shumaker trucking  excavating contractors inc b sept    cpd para  at  rather we will review an evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria in the solicitation and applicable procurement statutes and regulations a protesters mere disagreement with the evaluation does not show it lacked a reasonable basis vt griffin servs inc b nov    cpd para  at  here the underlying record supports the agencys evaluation in this regard under the technical capability factor the solicitation stated that each proposal would be evaluated as to whether the offered equipment was compatible with the existing braun laundry equipment rfp at  notwithstanding repeated requests during discussions asking the protester to explain how its equipment is compatible with and will interface with the existing braun equipment see ar exh  wsds proposal at  and  wsd failed to demonstrate that this was in fact the case as determined by the agencys evaluators id exh  evaluation scoring sheets in its comments responding to the agency report on this issue wsd does not meaningfully rebut the agencys assessments regarding its failure to satisfy this requirement rather the protester simply repeats the general assurance it provided to the agency during discussions that its equipment would be fully compliant protesters comments at  see also ar exh  wsds proposal at  stating in response to an additional discussion question on this issue that its equipment is compatible with the existing braun equipment and will function per the specifications set out by the va an offeror is responsible for demonstrating affirmatively the merits of its proposal and risks rejection if it fails to do so see john blood b jan    cpd para  at  hdl research lab inc b dec    cpd para  at  no matter how competent an offeror may be the technical evaluation must be based on information included in the firms quotation see watson indus inc b apr    cpd para  at  having failed to demonstrate that its equipment met the agencys requirements the agency properly downgraded wsds proposal on this basis based on our review of the entire record we see nothing unreasonable in the agencys evaluation of wsds proposal as marginal wsds complaints constitute mere disagreement with the agencys evaluation and as such do not provide a basis for sustaining the protest in sum the vas selection of brauns higherpriced higherrated proposal was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation the protest is denied lynn h gibson general counsel  the protester is not represented by counsel therefore our discussion of some aspects of the procurement is general in nature in order to avoid disclosure of nonpublic information our conclusions however are based on our review of the entire record including nonpublic information  the solicited equipment is part of a large three component integrated laundry system manufactured and installed by braun contracting officer statement at   as relevant here acceptable was defined as proposal demonstrates acceptable understanding of requirements and approach that meets performance or capability solution has few or no strengths ar exh  source selection decision at  marginal was defined as proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance id at   the issue is also untimely a protest based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of proposals such as the issue raised by wsd must be filed before the closing time bid protest regulations  cfr sect a  eg general dynamicsordnance  tactical sys b b oct    cpd para  at  dismissing as untimely a postaward challenge to evaluation scheme that could produce a misleading result  wsd raises other collateral arguments for example the protester contends that the va communicated with braun regarding early delivery of the solicited equipment  days after contract award before the rfp was actually issued protest at  wsd has provided nothing in support of these claims and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the agency improperly communicated with braun find recent legal decisions  »
