cells make too much of when the cell is able to make a lot of the topoisomerase ii  enzyme it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize so if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of topoisomerase ii you would then be  able to prevent cancer cells from spreading    our  proprietary technology our licensor advanomics corporation has developed a way to replace the diester bond with a carbondifluoride bond which acts as a perfect diester isostere  this technology allows us to create a large variety of therapeutic compounds that are completely stable and often more active than the original drugs  this unique capability allowed us to create our lead compound advaa an effective and highly specific topoisomerase ii top inhibitor    our carbondifluoride technology is covered by issued and pending patents filed under pctfr and pctfr   advaa is times more effective at killing multidrug resistant  breast cancer cells than etoposide the drug currently in use advaa is unaffected by pglycoprotein the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to antitumor drugs advaa has excellent clearance time halflife   minutes as indicated by human microsomes stability studies advaa clearance is independent of cytochrome p a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates advaa is an excellent inhibitor of topoisomerase ll with an ic of only  micromolar advaa has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats advaas initial indication will be multidrug resistant breast cancer for which there are little or no treatment options     our published data show that advaa is a true topoisomerase ll inhibitor and is significantly more effevtive at killing aggressive cancer cells than etoposide the current drug of choice check out sbfms drug advaa a vs the leading chem drug etoposide   results are better in every category except two and in the multi drug resistance breast cancer category mcfr its over x more effective    unique features of advaa    advaa can be taken orally  advaa is not a socalled metoo drug our technology is unique advaa will be the only topoisomerase ll inhibitor on the market  advaas initial indication
