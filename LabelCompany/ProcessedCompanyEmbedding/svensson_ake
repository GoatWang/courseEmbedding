 advanced dermatologyarevivela prairie synake product overview and side effects synake is a topical antiaging treatment that was developed by the swedish company pentapharm ltd and is marketed as an alternative to botox injections and other types of synthetic treatments that are formulated to get rid of wrinkles crow’s feet and other signs of aging this ingredient which is used in several different products that are designed to fight aging is a synthetic form of snake venom synake replicates the effects of a peptide that is known as waglerin  which is a component of the venom found in the temple viper a poisonous snake native to southeast asia this serum can either be used on its own or added to any moisturizing cream or other skin care product as an antiaging element the manufacturers of synake claim that it offers users all the benefits of botox without having to pay for costly injections however since products that contain this ingredient can also be expensive it is best to understand how it fights wrinkles and what kind of effect it may have on your skin before you make your purchasehow synake workssynake is designed to work much like botox which reduces muscular contractions in the face and reduces cell movement thereby keeping the skin smooth the concept behind synake is that since snake venom causes muscular paralysis a synthetic derivative of the venom would work to temporarily deaden the muscles in the face to prevent the formation or deepening of wrinkleswrinkles around the eyes and mouth form over time because the muscles in the face contract in repeated motions that cause you to smile laugh and frown these facial expressions cause the skin to stretch and wrinkle each time and eventually lines and wrinkles form because your skin loses its elasticity and can no longer snap back to its original position synake can be applied to wrinkles on the forehead the neck around the mouth and around the eyes although extreme care should be taken to keep the product out of the eyes much like botox injections the effects of synake fade over time and are not a permanent solution to fighting wrinkleshow to use synakeif you plan to add synake to your favorite moisturizer or facial cream and you have never used the ingredient before it is best to ask your dermatologist for advice about how to mix the serum into other products the ingredient is designed to mix well with a number of different skin care products but you should never combine it with those that already contain the ingredient as this may cause damage to your skin synake is water soluble and can be combined with thinner serums or even with distilled water or waterbased skin care products because this chemical compound has been known to cause adverse reactions in some users you should start out by adding the smallest possible concentration of synake to your skin care products until you know how it will affect your skinside effects of synakemany users who have sensitive skin have found that using synake caused swelling redness of the skin itching and stinging when the product was applied while not all consumers will experience negative side effects extreme care should be taken during the first application and the results carefully monitored before applying the product again this is important because the ingredient doesn’t work like olive oil or other ingredients that boost skin health synake is a cosmetic solution that targets neuron transmissions in your tissues and by using too much of this ingredient or combining it incorrectly you can cause prolonged problems for your facial musclesrecommendations – peptides are great cosmetics ingredients when used in the right concentration newer synpeptides were introduced to the market recently – take a look at  advanced dermatology it contains multiple concentrated peptides topbrandtopadvanced dermatologyrevivela prairie comments louisthis is just a very interesting and effective product that acts within minutes and has a long lasting effect yes it works and no it is not a “fake” product… it is not “real” snake venom but this does not make it a “fake” product it is very real and it is effective for those who ignore it this is what is called a synthesised peptide in the laboratory this allows to  focus on a specific molecule real venom would be really dangerous and contains more than just “one” peptide synthesis in a laboratory reduces the risk related to other undesirable effects and the final product is clean and safe botox itself is a clean synthetic peptide that mimics the effects of the toxin produced by the bacteria clostridium botulinum…  you simply don’t want to go killing snakes leave the snakes alone the same has happened with other products like ambergris used in luxurious parfumerie you simply don’t  so it’s not a matter of “”at least that is natural” it’s not because something is found in nature that something is essentially “good” this is why you keep the animals safe and science finds effective ways for treatments being from cosmetics or being in the clinicsshould you use synake i would say yes august   at  pm • reply may wilsonok it’s fake snake venom made to mimic real venom … so you are putting some fake crap on you skin which may or may not leech into you facial muscles seems crazy to me why aren’t they using real venom at least that is natural there isn’t anything natural about fake snake this no matter how you slice it seems like a really crap product once again making women feel bad about themselves for something that is a completely natural occurrence  we need to stop looking for the fountain of youth and drink from the fountain of truth grow the f up and stop buying this shit if every woman in the world woke up tomorrow and said we are perfect the way we are all this diet cosmetic  high cost industry would be crippled and imagine where that money could go and what it could do snake venom to cure cancer give me a break already these scientists don’t have to do the real work because we keep them busy with all this bs february   at  pm • reply carolis this how you get “drop dead gorgeous” no snake venom is going on my body anywhere particularly venom from the deadly “temple viper” january   at  pm • reply shivali sethiis syn ake supposed to be applied all over face or just effected area july   at  am •
