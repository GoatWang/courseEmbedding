furman the owner of fursher international at his retail location at 6 west th street new york ny will and i discussed him purchasing  of my customers furs from my boutique in washington dc to sell at his store will and i agreed that in  weeks he was to pay me  for the  furs the furs were individually valued to me at 75 75 5 and  i gave will possession of the furs i also gave will some time before i tried to collect payment as per our agreement when i tried to call him in september he did not answer or return my phone calls that same month i stopped by to see will at the store he told me he had deposits for  of the coats and the checks were in the mail when there i asked for the other furs back and he assured me he sent the checks another month went by and i still hadnt received the checks and ignored all my calls continued below report attachments  in october he avoided me when i traveled to ny to pick up a check for the second time when i finally got a hold of him he again assured me he had sent a check all of november he echoed the same response that he had sent a check right before christmas we spoke again and he agreed to pay for all the furs this time by the end of the year i then received a check for a single fur for  when i deposited the check it never cleared its bounced over and over again will became irate when i told him this he yelled assuring me there was money in the account i received another check for a single fur in the amount of 5 in january this time i cashed the check we called and called for the remaining payments everyday for a month and askedf ro the furs to be sent back always being assured that a fedex went out on a certain day with the other checks a week went by and the checks still never came we called again to remedy the situation his employee again mislead us about payment going out by a certain date the end of january came and i still had no furs and only partial payment my staff and myself once again would call to figure out what was going on with the other checks but we would somehow just miss will or even miss everybody at the store all together when we did get a hold of his employees they assured me that he saw will sign and send the other checks weeks passed before i received  additional checks each in the amount of 75 both checks however were post dated both checks bounced again  this now left me short  plus banking fees and  furs short my staff and i again tried to contact the furman he and his staff by this point became rude they would scream and curse at us after weeks of calling i did finally get a hold of will we discussed that  checks did not clear he would scream at me and told me he isnt going to pay the remaining balance i told him that i would contact the better business bureau and register a complaint if he did not pay he told me that he would sue me if i did that he also screamed at me and wrote a threatening note once i said i would turn hikm into the better business bureau he overnighted ceritified checks upon asking for all the bounced check fees fo  he yelled at me and said he would send a check we are still waiting he is a conman and do not do business here or leave

georgia aaa by josh szkotak on  february  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of furman v georgiafurman v georgia description of case william henry furman was on trial for the murder of william micke on september th96 supposedly furman had broken into the house of micke but micke had caught him in the act furman then ran and escaped out the back door he had then turned around and shot blindly through the plywood door killing micke furman was then put on trial for murder and sentenced to death however furmans story was different furmans story furman said that he didnt mean to kill micke he did admit to breaking into his house but he says that he did not intentionally shoot back at the door furman said that once micke caught him furman ran out the back door tripped and the gun accidentally went off after that furman got up and ran without going back to check if he had shot micke furman said that he didnt know he had killed anybody however the court thought otherwise the courts view o despite furmans view on the incident the georgia court still felt he needed to be sentenced to the death penalty people then thought this was an example of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment furman v georgia is taken to the supreme court the punishment of crimes suchas these depend on the state that they occur in for example while furmanhad shot one man by accident and wasgoing to be given a death sentencea man in a different state could torture five people to death and only get lifein prison death penalty the supreme courts ruling  afterward the supreme court eventually ruled that sentencing furman to the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment and furman was only put in a prison sentence for life however he was put on parole  years later later his record showed several more arrests related to weapons or alcohol in  he was arrested on account of burglary and then he was arrested once again for the same thing in 5 finally in 6 he was arrested for breaking into a womans home he was then jailed without bond william fuman the question still remained did sentencing furman to death count as cruel and unusual punishment but more importantly if the supreme court said yes it would overturn many more death sentences than furman the effects of furman v georgia today today the death penalty still runs strong despite everything that has happened the supreme court says that the death penalty can be applied if the defendant is convicted of murder is over the age of  and is not mentally handicapped with this ruling the supreme court left the decision up to the state that the person is convicted in with this ruling if furman v georgia happened today furman would not be sentenced to the death penalty based on the view that furman did not intend to kill micke httpwwwproprofscomflashcardsuploadq76bmp
