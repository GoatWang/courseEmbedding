newswire  impi annual microwave power symposium  nxp semiconductors nv nasdaqnxpi the number one supplier of rf power transistors today announced the industry’s highest power transistor for  mhz applications the mrfh transistor delivers  w continuous wave cw fifty percent higher than comparable products currently available on the market based on  v silicon ldmos this transistor extends the limits of solidstate rf generation making the mrfh an attractive alternative to vacuum tubes for very high power industrial systems this transistor brings ease of use to microwave generator designers it delivers exceptional precision control and reliability compared to vacuum tubeera technologies such as magnetrons the mrfh supports accurate power control over the full dynamic range from  to  w and enables frequency shifting that helps make precise use of rf energy it is capable of operating for decades with minimal performance degradation over time lowering the total cost of ownership it operates at  v for greater safety than magnetrons finally the small size of a solidstate power amplifier enables redundancy and flexibility of design “the reliability and enhanced control features of solidstate have long been understood but industrial system designers had difficulties combining many transistors to match the power level of magnetrons — until now” said pierre piel senior director and general manager for multimarket rf power at nxp “the mrfh delivers performance that enables industrial heating engineers to implement it in very high power systems” “given the many advantages of solidstate rf energy as a highly efficient and controllable heat and power source the rf energy alliance rfea sees endless market opportunities for the technology to improve existing rf energy applications as well as enable new ones” said klaus werner executive director of the rfea “the capabilities of the new mrfh will undoubtedly accelerate the industry’s transition to solidstate rf technology” this new transistor is designed for industrial scientific and medical ism applications ranging from  to  mhz especially industrial heatingdrying curing and material welding as well as particle accelerators it delivers  w cw at  mhz with  percent efficiency in a small  ×  inch  ×  cm pallet availability the mrfh is sampling today and will be in production in december  the  mhz cw
