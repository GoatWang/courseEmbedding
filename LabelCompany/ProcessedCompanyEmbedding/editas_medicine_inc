dna repair latest news  june    editas medicine to participate in investor… read more more news more news what is crispr crispr is a dynamic versatile tool that allows us to target nearly any genomic location and potentially repair broken genes but what exactly is crispr how does it work  crispr crispr technology uses a proteinrna complex composed of either the protein cas or cpf each of which binds to a guide rna grna molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular dna sequence how does crispr work cas and cpf can be reprogrammed to different sites or multiple sites using multiple grnas the availability of the different engineered variants of cas and cpf allows for different types of cuts for genome editing which include the following cut  revise and cut  remove typically result in disruption of a problematic gene or elimination of a mutation these approaches leverage the cells natural dna repair mechanisms known as nonhomologous end joining or nhej to complete the edit when a cell repairs a dna cut by nhej it leaves small insertions and deletions at the cut site collectively referred to as indels nhej can be used to either cut and revise the targeted gene or to cut and remove a segment of dna in the cut and revise process a single cut is made in the cut and remove process two cuts are made which results in the removal of the intervening segment of dna this approach could be used to delete either a small or a large segment of dna depending on the type of repair desired the second mechanism – our cut  replace approach – leverages a different dna repair mechanism known as homology directed repair or hdr in this approach a dna template is also provided one that is similar to the dna that has been cut the cell can use the template to construct reparative dna resulting in the replacement of a defective genetic sequence with the correct one what makes us different advantages of our genome editing platform in order to fully realize the broad potential of crispr technology to develop genomic medicines we must be able to do the following efficientlyedit a wide rangeof mutations reach the siteof disease tightly controlthe cuttingof dna achievethe rightrepair at editas medicine we have developed a proprietary genome editing platform consisting of four interrelated components that are designed to meet these goals each component is underpinned by several specific technologies and capabilities with our platform we are able to design and optimize each element of our products necessary to achieve the desired edit including the type of cas or cpf the sequence and structure of the guide rnas the delivery vector and elements to control expression in cells and drive the desired repair mechanism cpf complements our expanding toolbox of crispr enzymes increasing our ability to target additional disease mutations this new enzyme uses a smaller simpler guiderna does not include a tracrrna and produces a different type of cut at the target dna what would crispr medicines look like medicines utilizing crispr technology are likely to come in a variety of configurations that open the door to treating a wide range of diseases they can be designed and optimized to provide efficient and tightly controlled delivery to the desired tissue or cell type our strategy is to leverage existing delivery technologies to target the relevant cell types while also exploring a variety of nextgeneration delivery approaches bing places for business bing places for business sign in using your microsoft account work account

deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise in full their overallotment option we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million the principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial flexibility create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our access to the public equity markets we intend to use approximately  to  million of the net proceeds from this offering for preclinical studies and clinical trials for our lca program and up to  million of the net proceeds from this offering for preclinical studies in our collaboration with juno therapeutics we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for continued expansion of our platform technology preclinical studies of our research programs in addition to lca and engineered t cells working capital and general corporate purposes we believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions of complementary companies products or technologies while we have no current agreements commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at this time we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes this expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development and commercialization efforts the status of and results from clinical trials any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our programs and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering we have no current agreements commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products businesses or technologies based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses debt service and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next  months we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect we do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of development of any product candidates we may develop pending use of the proceeds as described above we intend to invest the proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including in the gene therapy and genomeediting fields are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products while we believe that our technology development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future we compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical biotechnology and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies including genome editing and gene therapy there are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs our platform and product focus is the development of therapies using crisprcas technology other companies developing crisprcas technology include caribou biosciences crispr therapeutics and intellia therapeutics in addition there have been and may continue to be discoveries of new crisprbased gene editing technologies such as the recently discovered nuclease cpf cpf is early in its scientific characterization however its researchers have asserted that it might provide advantages over cas in genome editing applications including that cpf requires only one guide rna in contrast to the two guide rnas required with cas which could simplify the design and delivery of genomeediting tools and that cpf generates staggered dna cuts in contrast to the bluntend cuts generated by cas which could be advantageous for facilitating nhejbased gene insertion there are additional companies developing therapies using additional genome editing technologies including talens meganucleases megatals and zinc finger nucleases potential advantages of these additional genome editing technologies include their degree of scientific characterization to date which may allow for more rapid development of subsequent programs the range of sites that each is able to recognize and the location of the dna cut relative to the recognition sequence each of which may allow for a different range of targets to be addressed and the orientation of the dna ends that are left behind after cutting the companies developing these additional genome editing technologies include bluebird bio cellectis poseida therapeutics precision biosciences and sangamo biosciences additional companies developing gene therapy products include abeona therapeutics agtc therapeutics avalanche biotechnologies dimension therapeutics regenxbio spark therapeutics uniqure and voyager therapeutics in addition to competition from other genome editing therapies or gene therapies any products that we develop may also face competition from other types of therapies such as small molecule antibody or protein therapies caribou biosciences crispr therapeutics and intellia therapeutics have all reported that they have obtained licenses to a family of patent applications that was filed by the university of california the university of vienna and emmanuelle charpentier and has an earliest priority date which predates the priority dates of our inlicensed patents and patent applications crispr therapeutics has reported that it has an exclusive license to patent rights from emmanuelle charpentier caribou biosciences has reported that it has an exclusive license to patent rights from the university of california and the university of vienna intellia therapeutics has reported that it has an exclusive license to such rights from caribou biosciences in certain fields the university of california derives rights in such applications from an assignment by dr jennifer doudna and certain other inventors listed on such applications dr doudna was a founder of our company and entered into a consulting agreement with us at the time of our founding however dr doudna gave notice of termination of that agreement in may  after less than seven months of service and she has had no further engagement in our business since that time dr doudna is also a founder of caribou biosciences and has been publicly identified as an advisor to intellia therapeutics in addition many of our current or potential competitors either alone or with their collaboration partners have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy safety convenience and availability of reimbursement if our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials they may compete with other products currently under development including genome editing and gene therapy products competition with other related products currently under development may include competition for clinical trial sites patient recruitment and product sales company description we are a leading genome editing company dedicated to treating patients with genetically defined diseases by correcting their diseasecausing genes we believe that we have entered a new era of genomic medicine as the growth of genomic information in recent decades has significantly expanded the understanding of genetically defined diseases a new technology known as crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatscas crispr associated protein  has the potential to achieve precise directed changes in dna the confluence of these two streams of scientific endeavor understanding genetic defects and having the tools to be able to address them creates the opportunity for us to achieve a longstanding goal of medicine to treat the root causes of diseases at the genetic level while genetic defects are now recognized as the causes of many diseases the vast majority of these diseases lack effective treatments of the estimated  diseases that are known to be caused by genetic mutations we believe fewer than  are served by approved therapies our mission is to translate the promise of our science into a broad class of transformative genomic medicines to benefit the greatest number of patients we are developing a proprietary genome editing platform based on crisprcas technology crisprcas uses a proteinrna complex composed of the cas enzyme bound to a guide rna molecule designed to recognize a particular dna sequence the rna molecule guides the cas complex to the location in the genome that requires repair once there the complex makes a specific cut in the dna ultimately triggering the cells dna repair machinery to address the genetic defect our platform consists of four interrelated components nuclease engineering delivery control and specificity and directed editing these components are designed to develop medicines that specifically address a wide variety of genetic targets reach the site of disease safely and effectively tightly and specifically control the editing process and drive the right kind of genetic repair our preclinical drug discovery platform uses the flexibility of crisprcas technology to enable rapid reprogramming of the casguide rna complex with the potential to direct it to almost any site in the human genome using this platform we aim to develop and advance a broad range of therapies for genetically defined diseases our product development strategy is to target genetically defined diseases with an initial focus on debilitating illnesses where there are no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood we are advancing over a dozen discovery research programs that we have selected based on our proprietary assessment criteria our most advanced research program is designed to address leber congenital amaurosis type  or lca a specific genetic form of progressive blindness with no available therapies or potential treatments in clinical trials in either the united states or european union the localization of lca disease in the eye allows us to efficiently apply our technology in a context that is confined and relatively uncomplicated compared to many of the systemic illnesses we also anticipate treating over time we have tested combinations of cas and guide rna pairs in cells that were taken from patients with a specific mutation that causes lca and demonstrated restoration of normal messenger rna and protein expression suggesting that we successfully corrected the lca gene defect in these cells we aim to initiate a clinical trial in this program in  we believe achievement of proofofconcept in a disease of the eye has the potential to validate our platform technology including its potential application to other organs and diseases our additional research programs address genetic infectious and oncologic diseases of the liver lung blood eye and muscle for example we believe our genome editing technologies have the potential to improve the characteristics of cellular therapies including engineered t cells to treat cancer to realize this potential in may  we entered into a collaboration with juno therapeutics a leader in the emerging field of immunooncology we believe that our genome editing technology has the potential to improve t cell persistence and overcome signals in the tumor microenvironment that reduce t cell activity in an in vitro study under this collaboration casguide rna complexes directed against what we believe is an important t cell target gene demonstrated approximately  editing on average by working with juno therapeutics we hope that together we will be able to discover and develop the next generation of engineered t cell therapies that have the potential to substantially advance the field of cancer immunotherapy we believe this collaboration exemplifies our strategy of selectively establishing alliances with leaders in their fields to realize the full therapeutic potential of genome editing our company was founded by world leaders in genome editing who have collectively made many fundamental discoveries in the field and have enabled the translation of crispr from its origins in bacterial systems to its application in mammalian cells through their service as consultants and advisors our founders were instrumental in defining the initial scientific vision for our company among our founders drs feng zhang george church david liu and j keith joung continue to provide important scientific guidance and insights to us through ongoing consulting and advisory arrangements their discoveries along with inventions by scientists at our company have led to our broad portfolio of intellectual property including the patent estates licensed from those founders institutions our portfolio includes  issued us and european patents and over  pending patent applications we believe the breadth and depth of our patent estate is a substantial asset and has the potential to provide us with a durable competitive position in the marketplace the lifeblood of our company is exceptional scientists and companybuilders with experience across leading biopharmaceutical companies and academic research laboratories our company is distinguished by our leaders substantial experience in translating groundbreaking scientific platforms into therapeutic products and product candidates at many successful biopharmaceutical companies we believe that our team and our culture are critical to our success and we are building a company with the values and people needed to realize the potential of our platform and develop medicines for patients with many different genetically defined diseases every decade over the past  years an important class of medicines has emerged such as recombinant proteins monoclonal antibodies and rnabased drugs these new categories of medicines have brought forth important therapies for previously untreated diseases in our view genome editing with crisprcas has the potential to be one of the next major new categories at editas medicine we believe we can make that potential a reality  we were incorporated under the name gengine inc in delaware
