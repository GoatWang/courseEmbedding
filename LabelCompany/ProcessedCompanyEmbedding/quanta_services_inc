than sp  component quanta services  nasdaqcom hot topics etfs  smart portfolio  currencies  online broker center search hyatt hotels corp larger than sp  component quanta services july    pm edt by theonlineinvestorcom bnk invest shutterstock photo in the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization russell  component hyatt hotels corp symbol h was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the sp  for example quanta services inc symbol pwr according to the online investor  market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on for various reasons the most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given companys stock many beginning investors look at one stock trading at  and another trading at  and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much  that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist but comparing market capitalization factoring in those share counts creates a true applestoapples comparison of the value of two stocks in the case of hyatt hotels corp symbol h the market cap is now b versus quanta services inc symbol pwr at b below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of h vs pwr note that we have found  split in the h split history  another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers  much like the way a midsize sedan is typically compared to other midsize sedans and not suvs this can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock and which mutual funds and etfs are willing to own the stock for instance a mutual fund that is focused solely on large cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized  billion or larger another illustrative example is the sp midcap index which essentially takes the sp  index and tosses out the biggest  companies so as to focus solely on the  smaller upandcomers which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals and etfs that directly follow an index like the sp  will only own the underlying component of that index selling companies that lose their status as an sp  company and buying companies when they are added to the index so a companys market cap especially in relation to other companies carries great importance and for this reason we at theonlineinvestorcom find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily hpwr makes up  of the
