cold inplace recycling is a major innovation to improve roadways and at the same time reduce the use of new materials and transportion costs cir is based on the principle that the inplace bituminous pavement is a sourse of materials that may be used to build a new bituminous layer  the process is carried out on site and reuses the existing material to a depth between  and  inches  the existing pavement is milled reclaimed transformed into aggregate which is then mixed with emulsion layed down and compacted to the specified density  after a specified curing period the recycled material is surfaced with a wearing course  cir is a very effective efficient process and should be considered on roadways that may be cracking andor deforming   based on the life cycle cost of pavement rehabilitaion municipalities have reported that the annual cost of cir projects may be as low as  of a traditional method   another benefit of cold in place recycle is the possibility of a shorter
