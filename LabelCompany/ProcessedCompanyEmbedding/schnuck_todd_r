david carson the youngest schnuck brother of six siblings — a man with a deep background in finance who has held the no  spot at schnuck markets — is getting ready to sit in the driver’s seattodd schnuck  will succeed brother scott in march as chief executive officer of the familyownedandoperated grocery chain with  stores in five states the maryland heightsbased company announced thursday he is a grandson of the grocery chain’s foundersin a recent interview todd schnuck did not lay out any grand plans to reinvent the company or chart out a radical departure for the chain which is marking its th anniversary this year rather he said he would continue in the direction of his brother to develop the chain’s food expertise and cater local stores to the needs of neighborhoods and he said he would focus on providing more information to the chain’s  employees so they can better serve customers “we’ve been very much joined at the hip in terms of our partnership and moving forward with the focus on food” he said of his years working with his brother “i like to say we’re brothers but we’re not clones i might have a bit more analytical bent than scott might have so the way i look at things will be different”when he takes the reins he will continue to have to grapple with the fallout from the massive data breach earlier that year in which as many as  million schnucks customers had their payment card information compromised in a cyber attackin the immediate aftermath some people became wary of shopping at schnucks but many of those customers have now returned and the schnucks say they are pleased by the recovery“while we’re not knocking the doors down we’re running even to slightly above last year” todd schnuck said of the company’s salesand he noted that despite the breach sales were up  percent to  billion in the company’s last fiscal year which ended in september that was aided in part by a strong start to the fiscal year before the cyber attackthe schnucks wouldn’t elaborate much more on the issue because of lawsuits but they say they have enhanced security and continue to look at ways to improve it they also just hired a new director of information security — a fulltime position for the company — who started earlier this weekthe succession plan scott schnuck noted was put into place well before the breach in october “i’m  — almost ” he said “i’ve been ceo for eight years i think todd is ready … and there’s a lot of things i want to do while i can do it”among those plans include chairing the united way campaign of greater st louis this year but he will remain involved with the grocery business as the company’s chairman older brother craig who previously led the company for  years will officially retire from the company and become chairman emeritus he will remain a shareholder along with his other siblings and a cousina new no as part of the leadership transition the schnucks decided to bring in some outside talent to be todd schnuck’s no  person in september anthony hucker  joined the company after holding executive positions with walmart aldi and giant food currently the company’s chief strategy officer he will be elevated to the position of chief operating officer in marchspeaking in a voice that reveals his british roots hucker said schnuck markets can better differentiate its stores for the local demographics than the large national playersthe larger chains “are about leverage and scale” he said “and leverage and scale is about standardization so they can’t be locally relevant … we’ve fought off and we’ll continue to fight off the best” when scott schnuck took over the company in  walmart was already breathing down the necks of schnuck markets with the expansion of its supercenters featuring a wide grocery assortment at the same time they were feeling pressure at the higher end from concepts such as whole foodsso scott schnuck decided the best way to compete was to build up the chain’s food expertise that meant getting rid of categories such as hardware toys and picture frames to make more room for food trends such as glutenfree products“we wanted to become the best in food” scott schnuck saidso today schnucks has  certified wine specialists  professional chefs and  schnucks cooks coaches who show customers how to make easy meals at kiosks in storesduring his tenure scott schnuck also spearheaded the development of two very different store prototypes in  — the squarefoot culinaria in the heart of downtown which is about the third the size of a traditional store the chain also built a squarefoot flagship store that features a cheese room and an instore restaurant in des pereshe also was at the helm when schnuck markets exited the memphis tenn market amid stiff competition from walmart and other chains it sold nine of its stores there to kroger and closed three others later that year it made a bigger investment in rockford ill when it bought seven stores in that market from kroger today it has  stores in the rockford region as todd schnuck prepares to take the helm of the company the chain continues to face competition from walmart dierbergs aldi whole foods trader joe’s shop ’n save and savealot but on top of that a new crop of grocery concepts enters the market such as the fields foods which just opened near lafayette square the fresh thyme farmers markets planning to open some stores here and a lucky’s market coming to rock hillbut he doesn’t seem fazed“it just makes us better” todd schnuck said “that competition gives you a charge and makes you say ‘ok what do we do to keep what we built over the last  years’”the next generationtodd schnuck started his career as an investment banker with ag edwards  sons he joined the family business in  as the treasurer and was the company’s chief financial officer for many years his current position is that of president and chief operating officerin the last couple of years schnucks has been focusing on store remodels to boost its core business for example the chain recently completed remodels of its stores in south city on south grand boulevard chesterfield and alton todd schnuck said the grocer will revamp an four or five more local stores before the end of its fiscal year in septemberthe chain is also in the midst of expansion in the metro east it recently bought the columbia centre market place to be converted to a schnucks store it has purchased land in farmington for a new store and it is building a new store near lindenwood university in st charles and one in evansville indas consumers have become more aware of the carbon footprint in transporting food long distances schnucks has increased its array of local produce and other locally sourced goods in the future it plans to buy produce from a yettobebuilt local greenhouse by brightfarms schnuck said that the plans for the greenhouse have been pushed off by brightfarms until junetodd schnuck will likely be the last member of the third generation of schnuck grocers to lead the company it remains to be seen the roles that the next generation may take on some of them work for the company in various facets and a few are just graduating from or about to go to business school“all have expressed an interest in the business and our job is to get them back here” he said business briefing from st louis
