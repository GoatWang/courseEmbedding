dares tread november   admin beverly flaxington “money is a key factor in all our lives november   admin boyd hoback president and ceo of good times restaurants inc nasdaq gtim talks with the opportunist’s managing editor leslie stone about his company’s record sales growth and its recent purchase of a stake in bad daddy’s burger bars hamburgers have become as synonymous with america as baseball and apple pie in the  or so years since the first ground beef patty was sandwiched in between two slices of white bread the “burger” has become its own restaurant category and now represents a  billion industry in the united states fastfood chains such as mcdonald’s burger king and wendy’s rule the category overall but there is a growing segment of consumers who have an appetite for a better burger for a quarter of a century good times restaurants inc based in golden colo has been serving this niche with its high quality allnatural hamburgers chicken tenderloins freshcut fries fresh squeezed lemonade and frozen custard “good times burgers  frozen custard is our legacy brand and our freestanding drivethru concept operates at the top end of quickservice restaurants” says boyd hoback “our main point of difference is that we are the only fastfood concept in colorado with an allnatural platform we only serve vegetarianfed natural beef and chicken that contains absolutely no steroids hormones or antibiotics” according to its recent financials the chain has been generating record sales and expects to finish its fiscal  with a doubledigit increase in same store sales for the year “we do things the big guys cannot and won’t do—from a product to a marketing to an operations standpoint” hoback says “it took us a while to learn that but honestly that is why we have so much traction right now we compete against some of the power brands in the world of fast food so we had to stake a very unique claim the good times brand falls under the umbrella of fresh all natural handcrafted food using unique regional ingredients and that has gained enormous traction for us over the last three years as our average sales volume has grown over  percent” opportunist we understand you recently purchased a  percent stake in the bad daddy’s burger bar restaurant chain which is headquartered in charlotte north carolina boyd hoback yes a little over a year ago we started looking for another growth concept we considered over three dozen with an eye toward something that we could expand on a national scale long story short we went with bad daddy’s burger bar because we were impressed with their concept and the principals involved one of them is dennis thompson a serial entrepreneur in the restaurant business who successfully developed and grew several concepts having founded lone star steakhouse and bailey’s sports grille which then became fox  hound which then become total entertainment most recently he founded firebird’s wood fired grill and sold it to angelo gordon  co a large private equity firm opportunist is this a joint venture boyd hoback they didn’t want to sell bad daddy’s—they felt they had perhaps sold firebirds too early—but it became clear we were a great match because they wanted a company with a longstanding infrastructure and systems and processes that could accelerate bad daddy’s growth we have rights to build company owned bad daddy’s locations in colorado kansas and arizona and we jointly own the franchise company which we will manage under a management agreement opportunist how many current bad daddy’s restaurants are there boyd hoback as of december there will be seven stores open in north and south carolina plus one that is licensed to hms host in the charlotte douglas international airport  the founders will continue to develop restaurants in the midatlantic and the carolinas and we are developing restaurants in the three states i mentioned colorado kansas and arizona we jointly own the franchise company and are going to be franchising on a national basis to sophisticated multiunit operators that are looking for another growth brand and that are used to being franchisees we just hired a vice president of franchise and real estate development who came to us from buffalo wild wings  he is now leading the charge for us on bad daddy’s franchise development across the country opportunist what are your goals for bad daddy’s boyd hoback we have a platform company in good times and a growth concept in bad daddy’s we plan on building several hundred bad daddy’s restaurants because the concept is very unique   it’s a high volume suburban gastro pub operated out of a fairly small box we recently completed a small secondary offering of  million with an additional  million in warrant proceeds available so we are well capitalized to accelerate growth  we anticipate that we will follow a similar model to panera bread and buffalo wild wings of a mixture of company owned and franchised restaurants opportunist please tell us more about bad daddy’s boyd hoback it’s a chef driven concept with artisan hand crafted food even though its core business is gourmet hamburgers and beer it operates above all the other casual themed competitors it is zagat rated and was voted among the top  burgers in the united states by usa today the other aspect that attracted us is the unit economics it provides a very high return on investment model it operates out of about  square feet which in our business is a pretty small footprint and yet the stores they have in north carolina are averaging  million in sales out of that small footprint so that’s why it makes it a very franchisable concept and one that we think has national growth potential the upper income demographic concept focuses it to upscale kinds of sites but there are literally hundreds of potential markets across the country opportunist what is unique about the menu boyd hoback the menu at bad daddy’s is gourmet burgers chopped salads appetizers with a full service bar that is focused around craft micro brews however the menu items are very unique and have a culinary level quality to them  so what’s exciting for us right now is not only has our core business grown like it has in the past—never in the last  years have we had a growth curve like we are now experiencing—but we can leverage our entire ga infrastructure with the bad daddy’s growth opportunist how did you get into the restaurant business boyd boyd hoback i have been in the restaurant business since i was  years old throughout high school and college i worked in the operations side of the business my degree is in finance and after graduating college i enrolled in law school but the company i was working for at the time gave me the opportunity to learn the finance and marketing and real estate—all the nonoperating sides—of the restaurant business and i liked it so much i didn’t go to law school technically i have worked for one company all this time—going from bus boy to ceo  my work with the prior concept ended when we started good times and spun that concept off opportunist what do you enjoy most about your work boyd hoback i enjoy that it’s so varied the competitive landscape is always changing and always moving so we have to be flexible and adaptive and innovative i find that very challenging i also enjoy the fact that it’s a people business and we provide a lot of opportunity to people and a strong positive culture for people to grow within in this business you have to be both creative and analytical i tend to be fairly analytical and i think i bring a good balance between leftbrained and rightbrained thinking opportunist  who is your main competition boyd hoback for good times believe it or not one of our biggest competitors is chickfila we tend to skew a little bit higher income more female and because we have the allnatural platform we are attracting the same customer who wants to buy high quality fastfood products we also compete against the fastcasual restaurants five guys and smashburger to some degree there are four tiers of our business sector fast food fast casual casual themed and polished casual bad daddy’s operates in the polished casual segment and good times is at the top end of the fastfood segment opportunist what would you like to tell potential investors boyd hoback we made the decision to stay public and become a legitimate public growth company which is a very important inflection point i believe there is a huge amount of upside opportunity not only based on our current performance but particularly as we ignite this growth our systemwide revenues for good times are about  million but we anticipate growing that exponentially with the addition of bad daddy’s i think what is compelling about our story right now is first of all our core brand has had record growth and we’ve had over three years of samestore sales growth—and that has been accelerating in the last nine months to the point where we are showing more than double even triple the industry average on our sales growth our core business is debt free with positive cash flow and an infrastructure that we are going to leverage over a larger enterprise by growing bad daddy’s we believe we are significantly undervalued and will see a lot of opportunities in our stock in the public markets opportunist what’s in the pipeline for  boyd hoback in  particularly as we continue to grow good times we are laying the platform for large scale growth in bad daddy’s we will have our first colorado bad daddy’s open in january and four or five other locations after that we also are in discussions with very high profile multiunit franchisees and plan to sign several multiunit franchise development agreements next year more than anything we want to have highly differential brand positions with both good times and bad daddy’s we want good times to be a dominant brand in colorado and we want to take bad daddy’s national for us that really is what drives longterm success the other part of that equation is for us to continue to develop a really positive growth culture for our people if we do those two things and we have great processes and systems in place then the financials will take care of themselves  leslie stone is an awardwinning writereditor with more than

boyd e hoback thank you mellory and thanks everybody for joining us again this morning with me today are sue knutson our controller and scott lefever our chief operating officer for good times and joining by phone this morning is jim zielke our new cfo that joined us this month and who we immediately sent down to charlotte to help with the integration of our acquisition of bad daddys international so first of all i would like to welcome jim to the call and you will begin to hear more from him in future earnings calls and as you hopefully have been able to glean from our filings and prior calls sue knutson is a top notch controller and certainly on top of every aspect of our financials that wont change so jim will provide us with additional capacity to accelerate and effectively manage our growth for both concepts while being also street facing with good communication and transparency for our investors so after we deliver our prepared remarks today we will certainly be available for questions and answers and i will spend a little time discussing the implications of the acquisition of bad daddys international and the offering that closed concurrently last week so we continue to see both good samestore sales growth and flow through to profit on the sales at good times our samestore sales increased  on top of last years increase of  which was also on top of doubledigit in the prior year so our sales increase continues to be the result of both transaction growth some growth in our average check driven by menu mix shifts and also moderate price increases which sue will outline here in just a minute our second fiscal quarter is our worst quarter seasonally so we certainly expect our store level margins at good times to be even better as we report our third and fourth quarter for the remainder of the year to reiterate when we look back at our two year stack in samestore sales growth our sales comps get more difficult beginning in this current third fiscal quarter which is two years of consecutive doubledigit growth so we certainly anticipate that we will begin to moderate to lowtomid singledigits samestore sales growth we have rolled out our new all natural nitrate free bacon and we began television advertising support this week for that we will roll out the summer shakes later this month and we continue to test other new products that support our overall brand umbrella and what we think is our core differentiating platform of fresh all natural handcrafted products our good times store that opened at the end of november is the remodeled burger king and it continues to perform well above our systems weekly sales average we opened another new store last week and concurrently we closed on a sale lease back transaction for its real estate assets and we were able to access an historically low cap rate for us for any real estate transaction we have done with the cap rate of  which is extraordinary we also have additional sites in negotiation but don’t expect any of those to open until  total sales for our three bad daddys opened during the quarter were a little over  million with the restaurant level operating margin as we defined that as a nongaap measure in our release of  which included significantly higher labor at the newest store that opened on january th so we are real happy with that our restaurant level operating profit in our northglenn store which continues to be the highest average sales volume store in the system was  during the second quarter which we are obviously thrilled with and our first store in cherry creek continues to grow really nicely it was up  in sales over the same prior year period we continue to expect to open four additional bad daddys in  in colorado while we digest and integrate the acquisition of bad daddys international which includes seven stores in carolina we are in for permits on three of those stores and we are awaiting the turnover by the developers which gives us about the next  days to really staff and support the integration of the bad daddys acquisition we closed on the acquisition of bad daddys international on may th we paid  million for the purchase of bdi with  million in cash and a seller note of  million that is due in one year our review of the transaction is that on a forwardlooking basis we anticipate that after we integrate the acquisition over the next three to six months we can be generating annual adjusted ebitda from the bdi acquisition again as we define that nongaap measure in our earnings release and we expect to be able to generate approximately  million to  million in annualized ebitda which includes the cash flow from the restaurants net of the noncontrolling interest it includes a  ownership of bad daddys franchise development versus our prior ownership of  and  of the royalties from the two franchise restaurants and  of the royalties from the airport concession license in the charlotte airport plus the elimination of the royalties that we would have been paying on our colorado bad daddys restaurants and that is how we get to that expectation of our  of the adjusted ebitda we believe that buying bdi at a multiple of  times or less is very attractive yield for our shareholders as we now control the brand we control  of the development off of a very small base of restaurants that has been successfully proven out now in six different metropolitan markets we will begin to consolidate the bdi stores financials beginning with a partial period this quarter effective as of the closing date on may th four of those restaurants are owned at  and the remaining three restaurants have some noncontrolling interests which may reflect in the same way that our noncontrolling or minority interest in good times are showing on our income statement and balance sheet in addition to the acquisition of bdi we closed on our public offering of  shares of million shares of our common stock at price of  and that generated net proceeds of about  million after all underwriting discounts and expenses combined with the sale lease back on the new good times restaurant that was completed on april th that now gives us over  million of cash on our balance sheet with very limited longterm debt after this acquisition so we believe the acquisition of bdi will be immediately accretive and will not only give us an additional platform for accelerated growth with two operating basis but will also accelerate our transition to profitability as we move into  if we can meet our expectation for these four additional bad daddys opened by early fiscal  we anticipate our annualized revenue run rate should be approximately  million to  million at the end of the calendar year and that is not including any new store development in  on our road show for the offering we said that we expect to be able to execute a  to  unit growth rate for bad daddys over the next few years and with the combination of the cash on our balance sheet of over  million our internally generated cash flow from operations and layering on the conservative level of senior debt we believe we have got the capital base to get us well into fiscal  our plan for  is to continue to grow in our existing colorado and north carolina markets with bad daddys and then grow concentrically from those basis of operations in  and beyond we may selectively franchise bad daddys however nearterm our focus is really on building a robust company on platform given the superior unit economic model and the concepts what we believe is the concept sensitivity to execution so we will talk about good times a little bit i would like to turn it over to scott lefever here for a minute and he will review our good times results for the first quarter scott g lefever thanks boyd with all the exciting news on bad daddys we continue to deliver good results on our core concept at good times even during what is our worst seasonal quarter of the year we are continuing to drive our fresh all natural handcrafted positioning deeper and deeper while we focus on continuous improvement in our store level execution on quality speed and friendly service we just completed our first ever television campaign focused solely on our breakfast burritos and we saw our breakfast sales peaked at just under  with yearoveryear growth and the average number of burritos sold by over  in march and april we rolled out our all natural nitrate free bacon in all stores as of may st which completes the all natural story for all of our proteins beef chicken and bacon we are supporting the introduction of all natural bacon with television pr and social media advertising through july we finished april up  on our same store sales and now that the rains have stopped in may are hopeful that we can finish the third quarter similarly on top of the two year same store stack of  as i mentioned in our first quarter call we had unusual spikes in bacon dairy produce and overall cost that began to abate later in the first quarter and they have remained lower in the second quarter including some moderation in beef costs as a result we are running close to prior year levels in our cost of sales at good times we implemented a small one step price increase in tandem with our roll out of all natural bacon which will cover our increased cost on that product our beef cost peaked in october and november and are stabilized but we arent planning on any meaningful decrease in beef cost until the supply chain catches up hopefully later in  we continue to make good progress with the reimaging of our older drivethrough only stores and have begun the more extensive remodels of a few including one that will be closed for approximately  weeks we have  or  drivethrough stores completed and expect to five additional drivethrough only reimages and two dining room stores completed during the balance of fiscal  the labor market is continuing to tighten up somewhat and in certain trade areas we are seeing inflation on our average ways at good times however we won’t have the anticipated cost of the affordable care act since participation rate was so low so hopefully we can offset what we anticipate will be a slight increase in our average rates for the remainder of  we continue to focus on continuous improvement in execution to leverage investments we are making on remodeling with specific focus on certain quality attributes reducing our speed of service and increasing our throughput at peak times and on the overall friendliness of our employees the new customer feedback tools we have in place our going to be very helpful in identifying where we are making good progress or where there are opportunities for improvement now i’d like to turn over to sue to discuss more in detail our financial performance for the first quarter susan m knutson thank you scott boyd already covered the highlights from our earnings release but i’ll point out a few additional things good times same stores sales increased of  was comprised of  in transaction growth approximately  in pricing and  in other components of our average check both good times and bad daddy’s cost of sales declined sequentially from our first quarter due to lower commodity cost improved systems and process at bad daddy’s and with good times down over  and bad daddy’s down over  labor cost remains slightly elevated at bad daddy’s due to extra management that we are carrying for our new stores planned in  all four general managers for the new stores have completed their training programs and are filing positions in our existing restaurants however with the new restaurant sales performance and the operating margin at these stores we still delivered  restaurant level operating margin for the quarter good times continues to see good leverage on all of its operating costs with labor cost down  percentage of sales from last year during the quarter and other fixed and semi variable cost also down as a percentage of sales which resulted in  basis point improvement in the restaurant level operating profit margin for the quarter in our operating prospectus we show that the four bad daddy’s restaurants that we acquired from bdi that have been opened more than  months had average sales of  million and a restaurant level operating margin of  last year we continue to expect and model the bad daddy’s concept at approximately  million to  million in sales with restaurant level operating margin from  to  we are running slightly lower cost of sales in colorado as compared to the north carolina restaurant driven partly by our higher bar sales and a lower bar costs and partly by certain purchasing advantages we have we hope to implement some of those purchasing advantages in north carolina over the balance of  our ga expenses increased by  during the quarter from last year that consisted mainly of higher cash and stock based compensation expenses investor relations expense director expenses and legal and accounting expenses we anticipate that we will have some ga synergies with the bdi acquisition embedded in bdi’s adjusted ebitda for  is approximately  of ga expense in addition to jim who is our new cfo we plan to bring on a director of hr and training and a vp of real estate this year we anticipate that the ga associated with bdi will cover those positions as we will have synergies in all other ga line items in addition for the quarter we recognized a  in nonrecurring acquisition expenses related to the bdi acquisition in the second quarter we expect total acquisition expenses to be approximately  so the third quarter will have approximately  of additional nonrecurring acquisition expenses we had preopen expenses of  included in those cost were the new good times that opened in may and the new bad daddy’s that opened on january th that also included a portion of post open training for that new store that opened in january in addition it included management training for additional stores planned in  restaurant level operating profit as disclosed in the supplemental information in our first quarter press release increased  over the prior year to a  million for good times and was  for bad daddy’s as boyd mentioned our third bad daddy’s opened on january th to very good volume and it contributed immediately to restaurant level operating profit even with its higher post opening labor cost that combined with the northglenn stores  restaurant level operating profit margin drove the quarter’s performance boyd covered the status of our balance sheet and liquidity after completion of the offering and the  million in net proceeds additionally we now own  of bad daddy’s franchise development so we fully consolidated and the affiliate investment on our balance sheet and income statement will go away as of the acquisition there was approximately  of cash in that entity which will now be fully consolidated into our cash balance boyd also mentioned we closed on the sale lease back of the new good times restaurant on may  the net proceeds were  million that will replace the assets held for sale on the balance sheet of  million and will fund the remaining development cost in addition to the anticipated annual revenue rate of  million to  million by early  we will provide more guidance on our expected ebitda next quarter as we anchor our page for development for  and finalize the integration of bdi we are trying to report same store sales for each concept with stores going into the pool after  months for good times and after  months for bad daddy’s due to the difference in the concepts maturation cycle for new stores we have seen some bad daddy’s come out with high honeymoon period of sales such as greenville south carolina store and our last two colorado stores and others that have had an approximate one year maturation cycle such as several of the north carolina stores the first raleigh store opened in the low  million range in its first year and is now on pace to be the highest volume store in north carolina in  in the high  million range the north carolina stores that have enough history are generating same store sales growth mostly in the low to mid singledigit range now i’d like to turn the call back over to boyd boyd e hoback thank you sue now that we have completed the acquisition of bdi our story is certainly clear and cleaner and is a pure growth story so disciplined site selection hiring good people not over growing our operating capabilities and maintaining the level of economic models we believe should deliver significant shareholder value over the coming years as we perform on those well some sites may take a bit longer to mature as sue said we’ve been more than encouraged by the recent new restaurant openings and so as we model the bad daddy’s its outstanding at  million to  million in sales and is exceptional at higher sales and i think we are beginning to believe that there is as much opportunity to open stores at higher than  million targeted level than below that as we continue to refine the model with everything from enclosed patios rooftop bars or site selection model and as we continue to innovate with the concept where we are obviously real excited about bad daddy’s so appreciate your time with us today with that operator we’ll open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of will slabaugh with stephens inc your line is open please go ahead billy sherrill hi thanks guys this is billy on for will and congrats on a good quarter just a couple from me can you talk about the ultimate runway for breakfast to good times and what that would look like and obviously you’ve seen success there here but wondering if you potentially had a longterm goal for where you wanted that to be as far as percent of sales and then what it would take to get there would that be just more raising awareness with your customers or will it be more driven by say menu expansion and more products boyd e hoback i’ll take the first crack and let scott jump in when we first rolled breakfast it immediately went to over  of sales recently we got it over to  i think we would like to be able to see that day part get into double digits i mean i believe taco bell has gotten theirs up to the  to  range with all that they have been putting forth that effort and obviously the millions of dollars they are spending on advertising we’re reluctant to just push sales mix and the reason being is that scott and nick have developed a really labor efficient model with the way we are doing breakfast right now so doing  to  mix is extremely profitable as we begin to expand that menu it has a significant impact on that labor model and so we do have some other things in test we have some new products that we are looking at we would like to continue to grow that day part even though it’s only gone up by a point or two as a percentage of mix whats significant is that breakfast has maintained that mix and actually grown as our overall same store sales have grown so where we’ve grown doubledigit over the last two years stacked on each other breakfast has continued to grow commensurate with that and actually increased as a percentage of mix on top of that growth so as scott mentioned where this last tv campaign where we actually increased our overall breakfast and burritos sales by over  so we’ll continue to put some media behind that and we have got some other product innovation anything else scott g lefever no i think that’s accurate i don’t think we are going to jump into new menu items very quickly we are going to evaluate it against our labor model and our food cost the singular offering of breakfast burritos has really proven to be very efficient billy sherrill right thank you and just one quick follow up if i could speaking to the site selection i realized that good times is obviously going to take on a slower growth profile and it seems to me there are some obvious advantage of keeping that concept geographically closed for brand recognition purposes but with bad daddy’s is your intention to tap out most of say the colorado market or the north carolina market before expanding to adjacent states or do you think that the brand is broadly appealing enough and you might find better returns by jumping in say bigger cities and states that arent necessarily connected to your home base boyd e hoback the answer to that is two sided on the one hand from a site selection standpoint we think there is still lots of opportunity in colorado and north carolina this is not media driven concept this is not a market penetration concept its really trade area driven with just the three that we have in colorado we certainly think we can continue to build here and without cannibalizing existing stores i think some market awareness will probably help the concept we saw that in raleigh the first store when they opened their second store in raleigh the first store immediately popped up  to  but more importantly i think is the distribution footprint and we want to continue to grow most of our growth in  will be in colorado and north carolina but after that then we will begin to grow outside of that what we don’t plan on doing it was hop scotching and jumping over to states that are outside our distribution footprint we want to try and maintain the same back door costs and with reasonable distributors it’s really important that we stay within that footprint so that leads us to kind of drawing a circle around colorado and around north carolina and growing concentrically from both of those markets even if we do franchise selectively we will certainly look at some new markets i think with that and we’ll see how these new stores perform if we think there is a better opportunity to do higher volume in a brand new market then we will certainly take the tact but i think for  we’ve got our pipeline and our handfuls with colorado and north carolina billy sherrill great thanks guys congrats again boyd e hoback thank you operator thank you our next question comes from alex fuhrman with craighallum capital your line is open please go ahead alex fuhrman great thank you for taking my question boyd certainly appreciate the comments in the prepared remarks about moving towards more transparency with investors in that spirit could you tell us your april comps i think you gave us january comps on the last conference call i would love to hear what april was tracking so far this year boyd e hoback we mentioned them in the prepared remarks we were up  in april on good times same store sales comps and not the most ideal weather for the month we started out may with horrible weather but if we can maintain that mid singledigit growth on top of the  two year stack for this quarter we’d be thrilled with that alex fuhrman yes but i don’t disagree with that you are not  i am just kind of looking at the comps you guys put up a pretty strong doubledigit comp in  now it seems like samestore sales are definitely coming in a little bit now that you are lapping the legalization of marijuana in colorado i mean do you expect them to continue to come in is there any concern that comps could revert back to prelegalization levels over the next year or two or you are just kind to looking to maintain that new normal and kind of grow low to mid singledigits of the current base here boyd e hoback we’re looking to grow low to mid singledigits off the current base we don’t think there was any risk of reverting back i think it’s really more the general state with the colorado economy that’s extremely healthy so there has been summarizing of the tide and there has also been our deepening of the ramp position that i think is gaining distraction so our plan is to continue to build on where we are alex fuhrman and then just thinking about the guidance you gave on the bad daddy’s side and that run rate revenue wise where you expect to be at the end of the year is that including the results consolidated in for that  owned store or is that going to be a below the line adjustment alex fuhrman no we’re going to consolidate that store since we have management control of that and then there will be a controlling interest expense and minority interest expense that’s taken out for their share of the net income from that store so we are consolidating that from a revenue standpoint so below the operating margin level there will be a reduction for that noncontrolling interest alex fuhrman okay thank you boyd e hoback  thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of greg mckinley from dougherty your line is open please go ahead greg mckinley yes thank you boyd you already talked about your bad daddy’s development plans in colorado and north carolina focus i guess first question can you give us a sense for will those be roughly equal contributors to how you think unit growth will develop over the next  to  months and then secondly you mentioned the possibility of some franchise opportunities overtime with bad daddy’s i guess how do you guys view pursuing that avenue do you feel like you need to show franchisees additional stores opening at these strong auvs or has that already been proven enough and now it’s more targeting the right partners if you could help us understand that boyd e hoback i don’t think the issue on franchising is really proving the concept out anymore i think the issue is what’s the smartest way for us to build the most value over the coming years and i think as a high quality controlled company on growth story both in terms of valuation that we would get from that as well as capturing the unit economic model and deploying our own capital end of that at least in the very nearterm is the smartest way to go that said and we do have franchise interest but we’ve intentionally been not signing those and pursuing that the larger issue i think is bad daddy’s is the kind of concept that is right for franchising franchising is innovative  in a way kind of itself kind of its own business it is real easy to sign up a few franchises but we need to be able to support them and have the platform and the resources in place to either go down the franchising path or not and not dabble in it so right now i think the nearterm as we want to focus on company owned growth we will then continue to have dialog with some really high quality high capacity franchise groups but we are not really  i don’t want to overstate that because i don’t want to position this as a franchise growth story we don’t see it that way we see it kind of incidental to our company owned growth plan greg mckinley okay thank you and then in terms of infrastructure so you have recently added a cfo you mentioned bringing in additional hr and real estate capabilities where do you feel your team is at now to support little higher growth rates for these concepts now in two different markets instead of one what are the key areas you need to make sure are setup boyd e hoback you know it’s really from an infrastructure standpoint and its really at the pure operating level so we’ve got so much and we got our  gms for these next four stores in colorado already through their training program and getting seasoning in our existing stores and we see padding the north carolina based as an advantage because it gives us a larger platform not only for the existing market but then to be able to develop opening teams and training teams and all the things that’s required for opening new stores so we’re going to be putting in district managers and in that level of supervision in both colorado and north carolina that will be our next step and we mentioned the director of hr and training will be i think our next key hire the number of people that we will be putting in place grows pretty dramatically so over this last year we have been working on more platform tools we have got good video training in place we have got a great very tight eight week training program for management we have got store level systems that weren’t in place that are now in place so i think we have got the functional platform ready to go it is really now the people side and so most of our focus will be at the supervision level at the unit level and at the training level greg mckinley okay thank you and then just two followup questions you mentioned taking  price increase with your bacon roll out where are we at now with menu price and how does that sort of anniversary over the next couple of quarters and then secondly i wondered if you could comment on cherry creek because it seems like there has been some meaningful strides there what would you attribute that to boyd e hoback our cumulative price increase so far including this  is about  so far we took three very small price increases kind of which has been our history and we haven’t seen any transaction erosion from that we don’t anticipate much more of any price for the balance of this year so thats  and maybe a small one later in the year but that  is on top of last years  so we took one right at the beginning of this fiscal year we took a smaller one in january and then we are taking this  now so the cumulative effect of those three on a weighted basis is  on cherry creek it continues to grow nicely it is cash flowing at the unit level which is great the construction is still going on around that store so we anticipate longerterm that that will continue just to get better and better it is interesting the first raleigh store kind of had a similar pattern and we had opened up slower i think than expected and then going in second year just took off and we are seeing some of that same thing from cherry creek i think as the bad daddys awareness gets higher in the market it also helps the cherry creek store i will tell you it is the top rated store on the review sites in terms of reopen and that sort of thing so we know we are executing well and i think that is helping to grow that volume greg mckinley great thank you boyd e hoback thank you greg operator thank you and our next question comes from mark smith with feltl and company your line is open please go ahead unidentified analyst hey guys it is ryan ph on for mark smith wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the delta in the restaurant economics between that cherry creek location in colorado and maybe some of the lower performing restaurants out there and maybe what you have learned about what is generating those stronger returns going forward for future openings boyd e hoback yeah i think the biggest thing that we have learned is really from a site selection standpoint and i talked a lot about this on our road show cherry creek tends to be more of an urban location and what we are seeing is it does the same weekday volume as the other stores what it doesn’t have is the huge spike that we have seen on friday saturday sunday in the other suburban stores that have other larger upscale retail cotenancy movie theaters and that sort of thing what we will do if we are doing  on monday tuesday wednesday we will jump up and do  on a friday and saturday cherry creek does jump from  to  but it doesn’t jump from  to  and i think that has been very valuable learning so everything we have got in the pipeline and if you look at the top performing stores they tend to have  they tend to not be real urban locations but tend to be a little bit more suburban kind of upper middle income suburban i think we also may be overshot the marked demographically in cherry creek a little bit it is the highest demographic population in residential in the entire state of colorado and what we are finding at our higher volume stores in these suburban locations is that i think the sweet spot for bad daddys is not necessarily super high income but good solid upper middle income and we are taking significant share from casual theme commoditized casual theme as opposed to these urban markets where there is honestly quite a few really cool restaurant concepts and a lot of choices while on the suburban locations they don’t have those same choices and so i think the bad daddys concept is really resonating strongly there so long winded answer but i think fundamentally it is a site selection issue unidentified analyst thank you that is incredibly helpful and then just one more i am sorry to beat the dead horse on talking about franchise in here but i know it is a long ways out but just wondering if you thought about it at all kind of what that high quality franchising partner might look like in terms of sites or anything operationally there boyd e hoback yeah i guess when i talk about high quality franchisee in this concept particularly i think we would want somebody that knows their market very well from a real estate standpoint and has good relationships with developers we would want somebody that has a good solid infrastructure in place good full service experience i think it is going to be key bad daddys is very different both in terms of its culture its employee profile and operating qsr so i think we would look for those things i think also then the market and the development area also is very important certainly well capitalized we would have no problem whatsoever going out and franchising bad daddys on a one off basis or a smaller basis to folks that want to get involved in the concept but i think it will be important that we profile good experienced well capitalized franchisees unidentified analyst alright thanks so much look forward to sampling the breakfast food indiscernible boyd e hoback thanks mark operator operator instructions and i am showing no further

bookmarksearch this post email this story printerfriendly version read more about burgers executive insights good times human resources robert thomas i started out in this industry as a busboy for a now nonexistent quick serve and have been here ever since i worked all through high school and college at the same location and ended up with a finance degree from the university of colorado i originally planned on going to law school but the restaurant offered me an opportunity to have more involvement such as in marketing real estate etc if i continued to work there i ended up not going to law school and instead took the opportunity to be more involved in the business even at a young age i always enjoyed the environment the culture and the people side of this business although alternatives like law school or a traditional finance role were options i remember thinking that the industry offers such a unique opportunity rather than being in a silo of duties this industry allows me to have a depth and breadth of roles and responsibilities running a business from a holistic standpoint has been a continual motivating factor with  good times and  bad daddys burger bar locations im able to contribute to the industry in so many ways having two thriving concepts is a lot of fun and the team energizes me daily because were a relatively small player we always have to create and differentiate its a challenge but its also a huge source of motivation for myself and for the team its an ongoing pursuit of how we can grow in the future were at a point now where we can really access the capital markets in a much larger way and accelerate our plans for expansion again with being a smaller concept its an uphill battle but now we can differentiate from a branding and service perspective weve found our niche and thats a huge bonus in this kind of industry that seems to change daily our allnatural initiative for instance really catapulted the concept and separated us from competitors—even the big guys i think finding key elements to home in on is important for a brand and our allnatural initiative really did that and has generated a lot of sales over the last five years in particular what was your first job busboy at age  what is your favorite menu item at good times i love our strawberry cheesecake addiction spoonbender we also have a killer green chile
