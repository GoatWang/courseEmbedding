filed with the secplease note that we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made during our call in addition the information we discuss on todays call is only current as of today may   and that any timesensitive information discussed may not be current or accurate as of a future dateduring our call today we will be discussing arc logistics adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow which are nongaap financial measures a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap measure is included in the press release that we issued today which has been furnished to the sec on form k and posted on arc logistics websitewith that out of the way we can turn to the first quarter  results arc logistics partners first quarter results were consistent with our expectations throughput volumes were up averaging approximately  barrels per day a yearoveryear increase of read morefirst quarter revenue was  million and adjusted ebitda was  million which were  and  below our  first quarter results respectively these yearoveryear changes reflect the combined effect of a decrease in minimum storage and throughput services fees offset by an increase in excess throughput handling and ancillary fees as a result of newly executed agreements and incremental existing customer activity which brad will discuss in more detail shortlythe partnerships percentage of takeorpay revenue was  during the first quarter compared to  during the same period in  which is largely due to simple  simply current contract mix furthermore our first quarter  revenue generated from investmentgrade counterparties or counterparties with investmentgrade parents was in line with our full year  metricsin terms of market trends the demand for lightrefined products across our network continues to grow and we anticipate this trend to continue as we enter the peak driving season this summer in particular we continue to see meaningful volume in revenue growth in our pennsylvania terminals as a result of our successful integration and modernization of these facilities resulting in increased throughput activity from new and existing customerswe also experienced notable growth in activity in our gasoline and distillate terminals in the midwest and east coast facilities our gulf coast terminals continued to deliver stable results despite the lower commodity price environment we continue to assess and execute on opportunities to support our customers who are principally focused on the storage distribution and marketing of asphalt fuel oil and other industrial products currently we are operating at or near full available capacity at these terminals and have deployed additional capital to bring some outofservice tankage online to support nearterm incremental business that will generate meaningful contributions to distributable cash flow over the next several yearslastly our assets that principally handle crude oil continue to support customers under longterm takeorpay contracts at our joliet terminal our customerdelivered volumes were above minimum volume commitments during the first quarter of  and we expect that the terminal will continue to be an attractive alternative to a portioned pipeline into this marketas i mentioned on the yearend  earnings call we are currently evaluating several development opportunities there including building new tankage and adding incremental throughput and handling capabilities to support new business at the terminal our business development team is currently in advanced negotiations with prospective customers that will require additional rail marine and truck infrastructure there and when we acquired the joliet terminal our vision is that it would become a multimodal transportation hub located in one of the heaviest  largest heavy canadian crude refining centers in north america fully realized the location would address longstanding inefficiencies at the refineries and within that market these development opportunities that we are working on and the customers that were currently negotiating with support that visionturning on  turning to our investment in lng terminal facility in mississippi which consists of a  ownership interest in gulf lng holdings group we continue to receive our proportional interest of the cash distributions from the entity while the pending arbitration dispute is resolved while we remain very limited in what we can say about the arbitration process and instead refer you to the publicly filed reports for a discussion of this proceeding we can confirm that the defense of this arbitration is being handled by our partner and the operator of the facility and although we will not be taking questions about this arbitration proceeding we continue to view the demands made by the customer to be without merit the arbitration hearing itself took place from january  to january  and we have no reason to expect any change in the timing regarding a decision from the panel our financial results reflect that the required contract payments are continuing to be made by the customers under the associated terminal contractsand with that ill turn the call over to brad oswald our cfo bradbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc thanks vince and good afternoon everyone this afternoon we reported financial results for the first quarter ended march   our adjusted ebitda was  million for the first quarter of    excuse me as compared to  million for the same period in  representing a yearoveryear decrease of  the reduction in our adjusted ebitda from the prior period is a result of the following one approximately  reduction in revenue and two approximately  increase in cash expenses as it pertains to revenue as we entered into  we made the strategic decision to transition storage capacity which had been previously contracted under monthtomonth commercial arrangements to longterm customer contracts as vince mentioned and john would assess further the customers were identified and the contracts were executed during the first quarter as a result of this transition which john will discuss in more detail shortly we experienced a reduction in our takeorpay revenue also during the quarter ended march   a few of our customers were taking advantage of regional market conditions and utilizing available storage for contango opportunities or we have previously negotiated stepdown in certain takeorpay contracts nearly all of this revenue was offset by increased excess throughput revenue from new or existing customers including those customers whose minimums were reduced and two increased ancillary services fees provided to our customers this increase and excess throughput in ancillary revenue is a result of the increased throughput which vince mentioned previously approximately  from the quarter ended march  our cash expenses which includes both operating expenses and our general and administrative expenses is a result  is a direct result of our incremental throughput activity the  increase in our throughput activity resulted in an increase of additives utilities contract labor repair and maintenance and supply expenses our increased operating expenses were offset by a reduction in our general and administrative expenses including professional fees due diligence expenses and allocations from our general partnerour distributable cash flow was  million for the first quarter of  as compared to  million for the same period last year which represents a  yearoveryear increase on april  we declared a quarterly cash distribution of  per unit or  on an annualized basis the distribution will be paid on may   to unitholders of record on may  the yearoveryear increase in distributable cash flow for the quarter is a result of reduced maintenance capital expenditures which we have already covered on prior calls offset by a reduced distribution from our equity interest in gulf lng holdings group as a reminder the first quarter distribution from our equity interest in gulf lng is typically lower due to certain annual cash payments made during the period for the first quarter  we generated net income of  million which represents a  million decrease from the first quarter of in addition to those items which resulted in a decrease to adjusted ebitda net income was further impacted by an increase in depreciation and amortization from our prior period acquisitions and prior period capital expenditures the noncash charge associated with the revaluation of the contingent consideration owed to the seller in connection with the partnerships acquisition of the joliet terminal and an increase in interest expense as a result of our acquisition activity in  and during the quarter the partnership spent approximately  million on maintenance capital expenditures in addition the partnership also deployed approximately  million on gross capital projects during  which john will discuss in more detail shortly the partnership continues to execute on its objectives for  and is seeing the benefits of its diversified terminal platform when making strategic decisions to optimize its assets for stability and growthi will now turn the call over to john blanchard for our business and market update johnjohn s blanchard arc logistics partners lp  svp of arc logistics gp llc and president of arc terminals thank you brad and good afternoon everyone the first quarter  was a strong quarter for arc logistics as we continued to show a yearoveryear increase in throughput volumes total throughput increased to approximately  barrels per day in q  from  barrels per day as compared to q  the approximately  barrel per day increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our asphalt industrial product and gasoline and distillate activityin this quarter we continued to integrate the pennsylvania terminals into the arc platform throughput volumes continued to increase in these assets as customers expand their business within this network of terminals these assets represented a majority of the increased throughput volumes in the gasoline and distillate segments as compared to q  we will continue to invest in this group of terminals throughout  albeit the  strategy will be focused more on optimizing these assets as opposed to compliance or upgrading them to our standards which was the focus in  now that a majority of the compliance upgrades in pennsylvania have been completed the focus now is on asset optimization such as allowing customers to deliver larger pipeline batches reducing truck wait times and eliminating other constraints or potential bottlenecksin our legacy terminals we have been focusing a lot of effort on terminal upgrades associated with the execution of several new contracts executed in q  and q  particularly in our mobile blakeley and chickasaw assets these new contracts include and require upgrades to our marine truck and rail infrastructure in addition much of the tankage or piping utilized for these agreements will require upgrades and due to the inspection cycles these assets will undergo inspections and then repairs if neededcustomers generally prefer not to take tanks out of service after they start using them under a contract and the contracts for many of these tanks will extend beyond many of the tanks respective api  inspection schedules as such a lot of focus in q  and q  was and will be beyond inspecting upgrading and placing tankage into service for these new customer agreements as these upgrades are completed and these tanks are placed back into service the revenue associated with the tankage under these agreements will commence additionally one of these new contracts will entail the construction of several new small day tanks and other asphalt processing upgrades that are planned for the construction  that are planned for construction in  accordingly we will focus considerable attention towards engineering and permitting these assets in q  to meet this deadlinelastly and always in  management will continue to explore strategic and accretive acquisitions that will help optimize our current assets diversify our product slate and customer base and expand our portfolio into new markets and opportunitieswith that ill turn the call back over to vincevincent t cubbage arc logistics partners lp  chairman of arc logistics gp llc and ceo of arc logistics gp llc thank you john thank you everyone for your attention this afternoon we appreciate the support of our investors and look forward to speaking with you in the future at this point were happy to open up to any questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question comes from tristan richardson of suntrusttristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  vp just a little more detail on the reduction in  of takeorpay contracts as you sort of elongate tenor shall we think about it as shorterterm contracts that may have had takeorpay terms or converted into longerterm contracts that are still feebased but not necessarily have a takeorpay component to it is that a fair way to characterize itbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc yes  no its a good question i think its actually a combination of both what i would tell you is we had a number of customers that were using our tankage for shortterm monthtomonth agreements for storing product the  so one of it is transitioning those types of contracts into true multiyear takeorpay agreements for the use of the entire tank which obviously is a great backbone for the  for those terminals the other piece is we had customers that say had a multiyear agreement with minimums that we underwrote for their new business and then as they transitioned into the second and third year of those contracts those minimums step down but the theory being that the volumes will remain so in many cases for this year part of it is the growth that john is talking about is will be the result of completing the project and bringing those tanks online and upgraded to serve new business for a longterm duration and then a part of it is a shifting from minimum takeorpay into excess throughputtristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  vp okay no brad thats helpful and then vince just on joliet talking about potential new customers and adding facilities and capabilities there and i think you maybe touched on the fact that  or the potential that those projects could be underwritten by these new customers do you kind of view that as eitheror in lieu of a renewal by the existing customer or are these projects that could occur even with a renewal from the existing customervincent t cubbage arc logistics partners lp  chairman of arc logistics gp llc and ceo of arc logistics gp llc yes hey its the latter tristan in our operating assumption our existing customer is using the terminal it was purposebuilt for them we have no reason to believe that they wont continue using the terminal in the future but in the meantime we want to expand the terminal to not only have access to but to serve the other customers in the market and to serve a wider slate of products and that strategy is not dissimilar to the strategy that we employ any time we buy a terminal in any market is we seek to acquire whats there and then enhance its capability for its existing customer base and expand its capability in order to serve other customerstristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  vp okay vince thats helpful and then just lastly brad you kind of touched on theres a normal component to the cash distributions from your lng interest that  theres a normal component in q that causes cash distributions to be a little lower it may have been a little bit more pronounced than we had thought in the first quarter of this year versus last year is there anything abnormal there its truly just  that occurs every yearbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc so its  things i think that the payments occur every year i havent gone back and looked beyond  just for this purpose but there were  there was a unique feature in  that made it a little bit higher but generally speaking its going to be in the  million to  million as a result of those sort of quarterly annual payments  those annual payments which are made during that quarteroperator our next question comes from ryan levine of citigroupryan michael levine citigroup inc research division  equity analyst regarding some of the expansion opportunities that you highlighted are they all contingent on a favorable decision on the lng dispute are the counterparties going to underwrite those projects if the  if you were not to get a favorable resolutionbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc maybe i think  i may have not fully understand the question so ill try to give it an answer theyre sort of not connected at all we are moving forward with those projects because they are related to the sort of customers in different markets and so we very much view them as we have the ability to fund and move forward with those projects as those projects that are underwritten by longterm agreements whereas the  obviously we want and are hoping for a favorable outcome on the lng but were not  we dont view them as tied togetherryan michael levine citigroup inc research division  equity analyst okay and on past earnings calls you had mentioned that certain counterparties may be reluctant to do new projects with your company given that potential overhang are there any of those such projects that are favorable or growing that would create more growth for our statisticsvincent t cubbage arc logistics partners lp  chairman of arc logistics gp llc and ceo of arc logistics gp llc i cant remember the comments that youre referring to i think that we had talked about that that ruling in our opinion has had a  or the pending decision rather has had an overhang effect on our cost of capital but i dont know that weve said that the arbitration process has had any sort of chilling effect on peoples willingness to do business with us that wouldnt be the case at all and in fact its not had an impact  because many of the projects that were exploring with our customers are  million  million to  million in size for the most part and so we dont have an impact from our ability to fund those on a quarterly annual basisryan michael levine citigroup inc research division  equity analyst and then last question you highlighted some of the dates of when the  some of the arbitration occurred in the past is there any update you can provide us around next steps from here or time linebradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc so i mean outside of our time line that we outlined which is were anticipating i think we disclosed in our prior filing that were targeting essentially summertime as hopefully a response but again thats always subject to change because it is in the hands of the arbitration panel but generally speaking nothing has changed outside of the occurrence of the arbitration hearing and we continue to believe that claims by the customer are without meritoperator our next question comes from selman akyol of stifelselman akyol stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md two quick ones for me is there any additional color around sort of the uptick in sga for this quarterbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc selman i believe the sga expense actually went the other way the total cumulative was down approximately  for the quarter is there something in particular that you may have seen in the release that youre looking forselman akyol stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md no ill just have to go back and revisit it the other question i had for you and i appreciate your comments on the joliet terminal was there anything in connection with sort of the board changes yesterday is it related to thatvincent t cubbage arc logistics partners lp  chairman of arc logistics gp llc and ceo of arc logistics gp llc yes so theres nothing  theres no correlation to anything operationally and the board change is completely separate events for those of you that noticed or didnt notice we had an k out yesterday referring to  items related to directors ill remind you that the governance of arc logistics is comprised of  independents and then  designees that come from lightfoot on one issue dan castagnola resigned and was replaced by john pugh which was a ge delegate to the arc board and thats from their perspective is simply a change of who their delegate was it has no change in ges relationship with the entity simply a changing of the guard if you will the other director which was in the same k is jeff armstrong and jeff submitted his resignation he noted in it that it had nothing to do with the company or any dispute or any concern but that it was a decision he was making that put us in a position where we only have at the moment  independents and weve begun the process to identify and recruit and place onto that board a third independent which will happen in the coming  i really cant give you a time frame at this point because were just starting the process but its something were focused on and were working onoperator our next question is from mike gyure of janneymichael christopher gyure janney montgomery scott llc research division  director of forensic accounting and master limited partnerships can you guys maybe remind us on whats happening at the portland facility with the purchase option and sort of what time frame that is in under and kind of what youre thinking therebradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc yes i think so just as a quick reminder we have the ability to purchase the terminal under the terms of our lease purchase the terminal at any time we have to provide notice to our lessor and then that can begin the process of acquiring the terminal at this point we are continuing to evaluate other sort of what ill push just strategic options that are available to us we like the asset we think theres a lot of longterm opportunity but at this point we are more focused on sort of other  as john mentioned evaluating other strategic opportunities that may be out theremichael christopher gyure janney montgomery scott llc research division  director of forensic accounting and master limited partnerships okay and maybe i missed it did you give an update on the  maybe your capital spending guidance for the rest of the yearbradley k oswald arc logistics partners lp  cfo of arc logistics gp llc svp of arc logistics gp llc and treasurer of arc logistics gp llc we have not yet i think at the  in the annual report and sort of last year we discussed that were targeting approximately  million that number at this point has not changed we are still targeting that amount and that  and those projects which  that  million which we discussed in the prior period did include an assumption around these projects that were executed during this quarter so that number is sort of encompassing of that  sort of that assumptionoperator im showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to vince cubbage for closing remarksvincent t cubbage arc logistics partners lp  chairman of arc logistics gp llc and ceo of arc logistics gp llc thank you ashley and thank you all for joining us on this thursday afternoon we
