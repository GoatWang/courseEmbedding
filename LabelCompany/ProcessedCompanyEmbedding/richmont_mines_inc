corporation reports strong second quarter results with companywide production of  ounces of gold at cash costs of  us per ounce the strong operational performance was driven by solid production from the island gold mine of  ounces of gold at record low cash costs of  us per ounce all amounts are in canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated second quarter highlights companywide production was  ounces of gold  ounces sold for the quarter primarily driven by another quarter of solid production from the island gold mine of  ounces of gold  ounces sold the mine is now well positioned to achieve or exceed the highend of production guidance for the year of  ounces companywide cash costs for the quarter were  us per ounce positively impacted by record low cash costs from the island gold mine of  us per ounce the island gold mine remains ontrack to meet or beat the low end of annual cash cost guidance the island gold mine reported record underground mine productivity of  tonnes per day exceeding the late target rate of  tonnes per day the mill averaged a record  tonnes per day and is expected to achieve the target rate of  tonnes per day once the mill expansion is completed in the latter part of  revenues for the quarter were  us million during the quarter richmont announced results from the expansion case preliminary economic assessment pea completed on the island gold mine the pea confirmed the positive economics of a low cost  tonne per day underground mine and mill expansion and represents another positive step forward in unlocking the potential of the island gold mine the island gold mine has delivered another solid operational quarter that positions the operation to potentially exceed annual production guidance at record low cash costs as demonstrated in the recently released pea we continue to successfully transform the mine into one of the lowest cost underground gold producers in the americas as we execute on our disciplined multiphased growth strategy commented renaud adams president and ceo he continued during the balance of the year our focus at the island gold mine will remain on enhancing operational and cost efficiencies executing on our expansion plan and advancing our strategic delineation and exploration drilling programs all of these initiatives are supported by our strong balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital

to achieve or exceed the highend of production guidance for the year of  ounces record low cash costs for the quarter of  us per ounce significantly below annual guidance of  us per ounce for the year mill head grade for the quarter was  gt gold partially resulting from lower than planned dilution in development ore the  mine plan assuming a  tonnes per day scenario forecasts an overall mill head grade of approximately  gt gold for the year record underground mine and mill productivities for the quarter averaging  and  tonnes per day respectively with lowergrade underground ore stockpiled for future processing also contributing to the improved overall mill head grade for the quarter during the quarter longhole stope mining continued in the first and second mining horizons and development in ore was advanced as planned in the highergrade third mining horizon stoping in the lower grade extensions of the third mining horizon is expected to begin in the fourth quarter the development of the eastern portion of the main ramp system reached a vertical depth of  metres at the end of the first quarter which is inline with the  development plan development of the western portion of the main ramp system was initiated during the second quarter for the first six months development of the  metre and  metre level exploration drifts advanced  metres and  metres respectively supporting ongoing exploration and delineation drilling both laterally to the east and at depth during the quarter the transition from underground development contractors to the internal workforce was initiated as planned this is expected to further reduce development costs over the balance of the year the results of the expansion case pea were released during the second quarter see may   press release the study represents another step in a multiphased approach to unlock the potential of the island gold mine the pea confirms the increase in underground mine and mill productivity to  tonnes per day that will support strong production growth of  at low industry cash costs and a robust cash flow stream over an eightyear phase  period for a low incremental capital cost of  us million the rampup to  tonnes per day is currently advancing and the operation is anticipated to achieve the target run rate in the latter part of  beaufor mine highlights production for the quarter was  ounces of gold  ounces sold production in the quarter was lower than anticipated primarily due to lower grades mined as higher than expected dilution was reported from one stope located in the q zone cash costs of  us per ounce higher than annual guidance are primarily related to lower production achieved for the quarter underground productivity was  tonnes per day during the quarter the majority of mining activities were within the main q zone however beginning in q mining flexibility is expected to improve as additional ore will be sourced from new parallel structures during the quarter the

investingsummaryin may richmont mines released its new expansion plan of the island gold mine in my opinion this plan is a game changer for the companythe expansion plan is founded on four pillars higher capacity of the island gold mill higher mineral resources higher gold grades and lower costs of productionaccording to my estimates the upgraded island gold mine is worth cmin my opinion the value of the main companys assets is above the current market capitalization of richmont shares therefore the company presents a longterm buying opportunityrichmont mines nysemktric is a midtier gold producer operating two mines in canada most recently the company released its preliminary economic assessment for its flagship property the island gold mine in my opinion this pea is a game changer transitioning the company into a solid high production and lowcost league of mining companies strangely this transition was totally ignored by precious metals investors in this article i am trying to fill this gap introduction now richmont runs two mines island gold in ontario and beaufor in quebec of these two operations it is the island gold mine that is the flagship property in  island gold delivered  thousand ounces of gold while beaufor produced only  thousand ounces what is more the flagship operation is a lowcost one  for example in q  the mine was producing gold at the cash cost of c per ounce and the allin sustaining cash cost aisc of c per ounce of gold on the other hand the beaufor mine was a highcost operation producing its gold at the cash cost of c per ounce and aisc of c per ounce of gold interestingly over the years the island gold mine was just a typical mine after starting its operations  the annual production was generally stable between  and  thousand ounces of gold but in  the company initiated a very ambitious expansion program and the production rapidly jumped up since that time look at the green arrow depicting a transition period chart  source simple digressions island gold in  the company started the island gold expansion program aiming at increasing mineral resources upgrading the processing plant and lowering production costs for example look at the chart below it shows the history of the island gold mineral reserves starting from  chart  source simple digressions it can be easily spotted that since  the company has been very successful in expanding the mineral base at island gold let me give a short description of the property description of the property as the picture below indicates island gold is located in the socalled michipicoten greenstone belt where a few notable mining companies operate or operated in the past for example wesdome gold otcwdoff with its excellent eagle river mine picture  source richmont mines gold mineralization occurs mainly in three zones lochalsh  this part of the property has been mined out island  the part of the property where current mining operations are carried out goudreau  an area of potential expansion this year richmont is conducting an exploration program here now the companys strategy is to go deeper and deeper at the island zone the current expansion program is focused on the ore lying at a depth of  meters below the surface simply deeper means higher grade table  source richmont slide  note the first mining horizon ends at a depth of  meters the second at m the third at m and the fourth at m below the surface as the table shows the gold grades are increasing along with depth the only exception is the fourth horizon where reserves are grading  grams of gold per ton of ore however the main part of this horizon consists of inferred resources part of them is included in the current expansion pea grading  grams of gold per ton of ore which is a very high grade the problem is that inferred resources are the riskiest resources a mining company discloses in its mineral estimates in other words due to insufficient exploration the inferred resources may prove to be uneconomic however according to the pea the company is going to start mining in the fourth horizon not earlier than in  so there is a lot of time to do additional drilling and convert inferred resources into reserves expansion plan in  and  the company radically increased its project capital spending at the island gold property cm and cm respectively this money was spent on extensive exploration upgrading the processing plant and development construction of a new mine at a depth of  meters below the surface however the first concept was to go deeper and expand the processing facility mill to  tons of ore per day from the previous  tons per day then in  the bull market in gold had started and richmont decided to prepare a more ambitious study on the island gold with the mill being upgraded to process  tons per day the difference between the two studies the  and  tons per day is huge and in my opinion the currently realized variant is a game changer for the company the chart below shows gold production under these two expansion plans chart  source simple digressions i am sure that the difference is obvious under the first scenario  tpd the total production stands at  thousand ounces of gold the average annual production is  thousand ounces and the mine life is  years under the second scenario  tpd the company should produce  thousand ounces of gold over the mine life of  years the average annual production is  thousand ounces of gold further the chart below shows the actual and planned capital expenditures under the  tpd scenario chart  source simple digressions i guess the company has a very good message for its shareholders  the highest capital spending cm the green line on the chart above was reported in  and over the coming years richmont is going to spend less and less on island gold the expansion of the processing plant primary costs adding new ball mill and extension of the mill building is going to end in  and will cost cm as a result since  the upgraded island gold mine should be processing more than  thousand tons of ore per year and delivering  thousand ounces of gold in annual production on average costs of production in  the island gold mine was producing gold at the cash cost of c per ton of ore mining and processing costs according to the  tpd pea the upgraded mine should be producing gold at the average cost of c per ton of ore  below the current cost for better comparison below i have plotted historical and planned cash costs and allin sustaining cash costs aisc of production calculated on aperounce basis chart  source simple digressions as the chart shows the upgraded mine should be a very lowcost gold producer for example at the current price of gold of c per ounce the island gold should be delivering free cash flow of c per ounce of gold on average the current gold price less aisc in other words the upgraded island gold mine should be a very safe operation  gold prices would have to go down to c per ounce us to make this operation uneconomic valuation of the island gold now the most interesting thing  the value of the upgraded island gold mine to find this value i used the companys data presented in the section financial analysis pea presentation slides  additionally i made one small adjustment  instead of the price of gold of c per ounce i applied the current gold price of c per ounce here are the results table  source simple digressions as the table shows the net present value of the project is cm applying a discount rate of  interestingly although the project presents good value the first major positive effects will be seen in  the red ellipse on the chart below chart  source simple digressions in other words the island gold is quite a unique mining project generally mining companies do everything to generate high cash flow at the initial stage of any mining project then over the years the cash flow generated by a typical project goes down richmont is different due to the specific mining sequence the highest cash flow will be delivered not at the initial stage of the project but later the highestgrade ore will be mined in  and later when the company operates in the third and fourth mining horizon refer to table  additionally in  and later on the capital spending should be very low chart  hence high net cash flow in  and later i think that this fact may be a sort of a negative surprise for investors island gold is an excellent property but the first major positive effects are to be seen in  richmonts share price action is similar to the broad precious metals stock market for me it does not matter but for some investors it definitely matters so the current price action of richmont shares looks as follows chart  source simple digressions the charts show the price action of richmont shares compared to the broad precious metals stock market represented by the vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf nysearcagdxj simply put despite the positives i discussed in the sections above in the current bull cycle in gold richmont shares have done nothing special as the two red lines on the lower panel of the chart indicate since the beginning of  the beginning of the current cycle there was generally no difference between richmont and gdxj share prices action what is the value of richmont shares as of june   richmont shares were trading at c a share so the companys market capitalization was cm additionally at the end of q  the company was holding cash of cm and debt of cm in my opinion the main assets of the company are island gold and cash what is the value of these assets well it is a simple calculation according to my estimates at current gold prices the island gold mine is worth cm refer to the section valuation of the island gold adding cash to that figure cm and subtracting the debt of cm i arrive at the value of cm so the final equation looks as follows equation  the difference is minus cm and it means that an investor acquiring all shares outstanding would have overpaid the value of the assets acquired is below the companys market capitalization however apart from the island gold mine and cash richmont owns a few assets that were not included into this calculation the additional extension of the island gold operation the beaufor mine the camflo mill the wasamac property a few other exploration properties in my opinion the wasamac property and other exploration properties do not show any relevant value today so they are excluded from my discussion the other assets are very interesting let me discuss them extension of the island gold operation at the end of  the mineral resources of the island gold mine were estimated at  thousand ounces of gold of which mineral reserves accounted for   thousand ounces measured and indicated resources accounted for   thousand ounces inferred resources accounted for   thousand ounces to remind my readers only  thousand ounces of gold are included in the  tpd pea so there is plenty of gold left for the future expansion of course all this gold is classified as inferred resources so the company has to convert this risky material into a more viable one however history tells that richmont geologists are experienced successful guys so the conversion of inferred mineral resources into reserves seems to be a question of time only additionally the island gold at a depth below  meters and the adjacent mineralized zones especially the goudreau zone are prospective deposits and a future gold discovery is in the cards if that is the case another ambitious expansion plan would have added additional great value to the company beaufor mine over the years the beaufor mine became dominated by the island gold mine chart  source simple digressions chart  shows the beauforisland gold production ratio defined as the beaufor gold production divided by the island gold production it is easy to spot that now the beaufor mine is a marginal operation for example in  beaufor produced  thousand ounces of gold while the island gold mine delivered  thousand ounces of gold so the ratio was  but in  the beaufor mine produced  thousand ounces of gold and island gold delivered only  thousand ounces the ratio of  what is more last year the quality of the beaufor mine deteriorated very much production costs went up significantly for example aisc went up from c per ounce of gold in  to c per ounce in  and beaufor became an uneconomic operation this year the companys management wants to revive the beaufor mine the allin sustaining cash cost of production should stand at c so the mine is going to generate free cash flow at current gold prices c per ounce in q  aisc was c so it looks like everything is going well at beaufor and the main takeaway is this free cash flow generated by beaufor means that this operation adds value to the company camflo mill the camflo mill has a capacity of  tons of ore per day the mill processes the ore coming from the beaufor mine but due to the fact that this mine uses only  of its nominal capacity it is possible to offer toll processing for the mining companies operating nearby in my opinion the toll processing should add value to the company improving the right side of equation  risk factor as i discussed above apart from mineral reserves part of the  tpd mine plan comprises inferred resources to remind my readers according to the canadian institute of mining cim an inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed but not verified geological and grade continuity the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes in other words inferred resources do not have demonstrated economic viability it means that part of the deposit located in the fourth horizon of the island gold mine where the inferred resources are located is more risky than the other parts of the deposit however in my opinion it is just a theoretical risk  the company has plenty of time to convert the inferred resources into reserves mining operations in the fourth horizon will start not earlier than in  summary in my opinion the  tpd expansion plan of the island gold mine is a game changer for richmont the average annual production should amount to  thousand ounces of gold over the mine life of  years according to the previous  tpd expansion plan the annual production was to stand at  thousand ounces over the mine life of  years with the average aisc of c per ounce the upgraded mine is going to be a very lowcost producer of gold low cost of production means that island gold has a very wide economic moat gold prices would have to go down to around us to make this mine uneconomic under the current expansion plan the island gold should produce  thousand ounces of gold over its mine life however the total island golds mineral resources are estimated at  thousand ounces nearly twice as many as the current mine is going to produce in other words the island gold mine has huge upside potential it may double in size relatively easy according to my calculations the current welldefined assets island gold and cash are worth cm this figure is slightly below the current market capitalization of cm but it does not take into account such items as for example the beaufor mine the camflo mill and a possible additional expansion of the island gold in other words richmont shares seem to be undervalued now despite these positives investors seem to ignore richmont and its ambitious island gold expansion plan i discussed this issue in the section valuation of the island gold  due to a specific mining sequence at island gold the first major positive effects should be visible in  for many investors it is a long time maybe too long so they probably have chosen to stay away from these shares however i believe that from the longterm perspective richmont presents a very interesting buying opportunity now disclosure i amwe are long gdxj i wrote this article myself and
