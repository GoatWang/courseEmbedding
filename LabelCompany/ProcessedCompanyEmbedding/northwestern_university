search this website search cosmetic complaints climb but products still on market study highlights poor reporting to the fda of potentially harmful cosmetic products and calls for better data along with policy changes june    by kristin samuelson a graphic from the study illustrating the significant increase in adverse event reports from  to chicago  many cosmetic products entice consumers with active ingredients that will plump lengthen and boostbut the cost depending on the product may be serious injury or worse according to a new northwestern medicine studythe study reports consumer complaints more than doubled for cosmetic products from  to  with hair care products being the biggest offender but consumers remain at risk because the industry receives little regulatory scrutiny and does not require preapproval from the food and drug administration fdathe fda has much less authority to recall cosmetics from the market in stark contrast to drugs or medical devices” said corresponding author dr steve xu a resident physician in dermatology at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine “it’s harder for the fda to get harmful cosmetics off the shelves”fda approval not required for most cosmeticssince cosmetic manufacturers are not required to submit adverse health events to the fda the current data sources to track product safety are significantly limited even though there were more than  events reported to the fda from  to  it’s likely only the tip of the iceberg xu said he suspects many events are not reported by consumers or doctorsthe study was published today june  in jama internal medicine“this is really a wakeup call” xu said “the point of the paper is to broaden the awareness of this database and the need for everyone to participate in reporting adverse events from cosmetics”adverse events from hair care and skincare products and tattoos were most commonly reported by consumersthe most common complaints in the database were for hair care products skincare products or tattoos the study found the number of overall adverse events jumped from  in  to  in  with hair care products seeing the largest increase baby products unclassifiable products personal cleanliness products hair care products and hair coloring products had the highest proportion of selfreports of a serious adverse health outcome such as serious injury death disabilitythe research highlights the need for better data“this is a  billionayear global industry with millions of products on the market” xu said “but we are only getting on average between  and  adverse events per year that represents significant underreporting if we want more public safety and to keep dangerous products off the market the first step is the make sure we have reasonably good data the key point of our results is we don’t have it” an ongoing investigationin  the fda sent letters to manufacturers chaz dean and guthy renker llc in response to  consumer complaints of hair and scalp problems related to the wen by chaz dean cleansing conditioners only then did the fda discover that the manufacturers had already received  consumer complaints of scalp irritation and alopecia“if this was a drug the story would be much different in regards to regulatory action” xu said “three or four people can be wrong but it’s hard to ignore  it’s concerning when  people complained to the manufacturer and the fda received only  of those due to poor reporting from the manufacturer”the fda’s investigation on wen by chaz dean cleansing conditioner products is ongoing and the products are still available xu saidthe problem with cosmeceuticals what concerns xu the most are products that contain cosmeceuticals which market themselves as cosmetic products but with an “active ingredient” “although not explicitly studied this cosmetic product class is becoming a growing problem” xu said “many of these products are really making druglike claims but are skirting the fda approval pathway by presenting themselves as a cosmetic at the very best these products are making unsubstantiated marketing claims for products that may or may not work at the very worst there are actual drug components in these products that can cause real harm” additionally xu said he hopes the study’s findings raise awareness of sendianne feinstein’s dca personal care products safety act which aims to tighten cosmetic regulation“feinstein’s bill is a first step forward in the right direction” xu said “i would have liked an explicit push towards cosmeceutical regulation overall the fda should have the power to order recalls and mandate that manufacturers declare their products’ ingredients and report every adverse consumer health event to the fda” topics feinberg school of medicine

practicing scientists digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition eg removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car and the compression and transmission of images and videos if you watch videos online or share photos via a social media website you use this everyday for economical storage and efficient transmission this course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing we will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two and threedimensional signals in the spatial spatiotemporal and frequency domains in this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including imagevideo enhancement recovery and compression  but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using

assembly granted a charter to the trustees of the northwestern university making it the first chartered university in illinois the schools nine founders all of whom were methodists three of them

nonsectarian admissions believing that northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory university hall  the second building constructed on campus and the oldest building still

northwestern university pritzker school of law is the oldest law school in chicago as the university increased in wealth and distinction and enrollments grew these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in evanston the result was a modern research university combining professional graduate and undergraduate programs which gave equal weight to teaching and research the association of american universities invited northwestern to become a member in  deering library  under walter dill scotts presidency from  to  northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in chicago designed by james gamble rogers to house the professional schools established the kellogg school of management and built several prominent buildings on the evanston campus dyche stadium now

liked the idea the northwestern alumni however were vehemently opposed to it fearing the loss of their alma mater and its many traditions that distinguished northwestern from chicago the medical school for example was oriented toward training practitioners and feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the larger researchoriented university of chicago medical school the merger plan was dropped the deering family gave an unrestricted gift of  million in  that rescued the budget bringing it up to  million in  that allowed many of the spending cuts to be restored including

northwesterns exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension though government support for universities

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a
