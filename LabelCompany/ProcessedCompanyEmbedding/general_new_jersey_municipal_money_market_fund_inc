your costs would be          year  years  years  years     principal investment strategy as a money market fund the fund is subject to the maturity quality liquidity and diversification requirements of rule a under the investment company act of  as amended which are designed to help money market funds maintain a stable share price of  to pursue its goal the fund normally invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in shortterm high quality municipal obligations that provide income exempt from federal and new jersey state income taxes the fund also may invest in high quality shortterm structured notes which are derivative instruments whose value is tied to underlying municipal obligations although the fund seeks to provide income exempt from federal and new jersey state income taxes income from some of the funds holdings may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax principal risks an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit it is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or any other government agency although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at  per share it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund the funds yield will fluctuate as the shortterm securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest rates additionally while the fund has maintained a constant share price since inception and will continue to try to do so neither the dreyfus corporation nor its affiliates are required to make a capital infusion enter into a capital support agreement or take other actions to prevent the funds share price from falling below  the following are the principal risks that could reduce the funds income level andor share price ·   interest rate risk this risk refers to the decline in the prices of fixedincome securities that may accompany a rise in the overall level of interest rates a sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money market funds share price to drop below a dollar a low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a positive yield or paying fund expenses out of fund assets and could impair the funds ability to maintain a stable net asset value    ·   credit risk failure of an issuer to make timely interest or principal payments or a decline or perception of a decline in the credit quality of a security can cause the securitys price to fall although the fund invests only in high quality debt securities any of the funds holdings could have its credit rating downgraded or could default the credit quality and prices of the securities held by the fund can change rapidly in certain market environments and the default or a significant price decline of a single holding could impair the funds ability to maintain a stable net asset value ·   liquidity risk when there is little or no active trading market for specific types of securities it can become more difficult to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near their perceived value in such a market the value of such securities may fall dramatically potentially impairing the funds ability to maintain a stable net asset value even during periods of declining interest rates also during such periods redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may impair the funds ability to maintain a stable net asset value and adversely affect remaining fund shareholders ·   regulatory risk  the securities and exchange commission has adopted amendments to the rules governing money market funds that may change the way that the fund and similar money market funds operate under the amended rules as of october   the share price of money market funds that will be designated as institutional prime or institutional municipal type money funds would fluctuate and as a result shares of those funds when sold may be worth more or less than their original purchase price in addition as of october   all prime and all municipal money market funds become subject to a regime of liquidity fees imposed upon the sale of their shares or the temporary suspension of redemptions in each case triggered and subject to board determination by the percentage of a funds weekly liquid assets falling below certain minimums as defined in amended rule a the amendments impose additional regulatory and reporting requirements on all money market funds which generally are expected to be implemented by the funds by april   as a result of the amendments additional expenses may be incurred by the fund ·   municipal securities risk  the amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less than that for corporate equities or bonds special factors such as legislative changes and state and local economic and business developments may adversely affect the yield andor value of the funds investments in municipal securities other factors include the general conditions of the municipal securities market the size of the particular offering the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue changes in economic business or political conditions relating to a particular municipal project municipality or state territory or possession of the united states in which the fund invests may have an impact on the funds ability to maintain a stable net asset value ·   tax risk to be taxexempt municipal obligations generally must meet certain regulatory requirements if any such municipal obligation fails to meet these regulatory requirements the interest received by the fund from its investment in such obligations and distributed to fund shareholders will be taxable ·   structured notes risk structured notes a type of derivative instrument can be volatile and the possibility of default by the financial institution or counterparty may be greater for these instruments than for other types of money market instruments structured notes typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions and thus an active trading market for such instruments may not exist ·   statespecific risk the fund is subject to the risk that new jerseys economy and the revenues underlying its municipal obligations may decline investing primarily in a single state makes the fund more sensitive to risks specific to the state and may magnify other risks ·   nondiversification risk the fund is nondiversified which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers therefore the funds performance may be more vulnerable to changes in the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund performance the following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund the bar chart shows

investments or limitations on buying or selling shares please consult your financial representative money market funds generally are used by investors for shortterm investments often in place of bank checking or savings accounts or for cash management purposes investors value the ability to add and withdraw their funds quickly without restriction for this reason although dreyfus discourages excessive trading and other abusive trading practices the fund has not adopted policies and procedures or imposed redemption fees or other restrictions such as minimum holding periods to deter frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares dreyfus also believes that money market funds such as the fund are not targets of abusive trading practices because money market funds seek to maintain a  per share price and typically do not fluctuate in value based on market prices however frequent purchases and redemptions of the funds shares could increase the funds transaction costs such as market spreads and custodial fees and may interfere with the efficient management of the funds portfolio which could detract from the funds performance accordingly the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase or exchange request in whole or in part funds in the dreyfus family of funds that are not money market mutual funds have approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent abusive trading practices in those mutual funds which may apply to exchanges from or into the fund if you plan to exchange your fund shares for shares of another dreyfus fund please read the prospectus of that other dreyfus fund for more information the fund also reserves the right to ·   change or discontinue fund exchanges or temporarily suspend exchanges during unusual market conditions ·   change its minimum or maximum investment amounts ·   delay sending out redemption proceeds for up to seven days generally applies only during unusual market conditions or in cases of very large redemptions or excessive trading ·   redeem in kind or make payments in securities rather than cash if the amount redeemed is large enough to affect fund operations for example if it exceeds  of the funds assets the fund also may process purchase and sale orders and calculate its nav on days the funds primary trading markets are open and the funds management determines to do so small account policies to offset the relatively higher costs of servicing smaller accounts the fund charges regular accounts with balances below  an annual fee of  the fee will be imposed during the fourth quarter of each calendar year the fee will be waived for any investor whose aggregate dreyfus mutual fund investments total at least  accounts participating in automatic investment programs and accounts opened through a financial institution if your account falls below  the fund may ask you to increase your balance if it is still below  after  days the fund may close your account and send

distributes these gains less any losses to shareholders as capital gain distributions the fund normally pays dividends monthly and capital gain distributions if any annually fund dividends and capital gain distributions will be reinvested in the fund unless you instruct the fund otherwise there are no fees or sales charges on reinvestments    the fund anticipates that dividends paid by the fund generally will be exempt from federal and new jersey state income taxes however the fund may realize and distribute taxable income and capital gains from time to time as a result of the funds normal investment activities for new jersey state personal income tax purposes distributions derived from interest on municipal securities of new jersey issuers and from interest on qualifying securities

income taxes the tax status of any distribution generally is the same regardless of how long you have been in the fund and whether you reinvest your distributions or take them in cash your sale of
