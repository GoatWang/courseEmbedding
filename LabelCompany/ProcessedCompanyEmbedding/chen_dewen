million and nongaap net income of us million for the first quarter both meeting the top end of our guidance we started the year with a clear strategic focus targeting mmorpg and advanced casual games in china and we are now looking at expanding further overseas in china the main revenue growth driver for mobile games is now increasing user consumption and in particular increasing the desire and opportunity for gamers to pay within the games as a result the market is dominated by two major type spend mmorpg and advanced casual games mmorpg currently accounts for more than half of the market share for mobile games within this highly competitive environment only games with the highest quality features such as unique social functions innovative game play premium graphics and cuttingedge technology can help a game standout changyou has accumulated years of experience in developing mmorpg in a pc game era and we have incubated a great group of creators and talented producers therefore mmorpg will always be our strategic focus and we will work hard to continue developing the best games around while mmorpg are a dominant genre in the market advanced casual games are catching up with short game sessions quick game play and combated elements advanced casual games are proving to be very popular with young players we’re encouraging our producers to test out ideas and develop new games in this category which will hopefully open new doors for changyou down the line as far as overseas games market are concerned north america in particular is obviously substantial and is dominated by advanced casual games and slg games currently these two types of games are also growing in china and have been leading to a large overlap between two regions in response we are working hard to break into various overseas markets for advanced casual games and slg games we also plan to explore some other innovative game models such as strategic roleplaying games our strategy for new game development is now clear meanwhile our strategy for existing games continue to evolve around extending the longevity of these games by creating sustainable ingame environments which has proven to be effective over the last couple of quarters tlbb pc revenue experienced a slight decline quarteroverquarter due to the impact of the chinese new year holiday while the decline was more moderate than our previous expectations this was mainly because the expansion pack that we launched at end of last year continued to drive our revenue into the first quarter in addition we also adjusted our ingame operational strategy and game play over the past year we have cut down a number of ingame promotions which led to a stable user base we will further reduce a number of ingame promotions during the second quarter in order to achieve a sustainable ingame environment and further prolong the games lifespan as such we currently expect revenue from tlbb in the second quarter to decrease  quarteroverquarter tlbb d revenues were essentially flat for the first quarter instead of a decline that we previously expected after more than two years of operations our top priority is to maintain user stability during the first quarter we launched two expansion packs in which we improved the clans battle system held a valentine’s day event and introduced new socially interactive game play all of this helped to support user interest and monetization of the game we plan to launch another new impact in the second quarter and hope to keep the revenue level flat quartertoquarter for new games our longwaited legacy tlbb mobile game is scheduled to launch in midmay wei qing our chief games development officer will give you an update on the latest progress of the legacy tlbb a bit later before we officially launch legacy tlbb our revenue projections for the game remain uncertain given the significance of this game to changyou and uncertainty inherent at this time we believe that it is best to take a conservative approach and not include any projections for the game in our second quarter guidance so overall excluding the potential impact of legacy tlbb we are expecting to see a modest decline sequentially in the second quarter revenues now let me turn the call over to wei qing wei qing interpreted we conducted a second round of tests on legacy tlbb in march the results were in line with our expectations and improved greatly over the first round of tests in particular we saw a major improvement in user behavior among noncore users after we adjusted the introductory sessions for new players and simplified some of the game play making it easier for users to familiarize themselves with the game and play within the game we plan to start our open beta testing in midmay before then our team will continue to modify the game and make incremental improvements based on the latest test results we hope to give the game the greatest possible chance of becoming a hit now let me turn the call over to our cfo ms jasmine zhou to discuss the financial highlights jasmine zhou thank you wei qing now let me walk you through our financial highlights for the first quarter revenue total revenue was us million meeting the top end of the company’s guidance down  both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter the depreciation of rmb against the us dollar impacted our reported financial results on year basis on a constant exchange rate basis total revenue in the first quarter of  would have been us million higher than  instead of  yearoveryear online game revenue was in line with our guidance at us million down  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter the yearoveryear decrease was mainly due to the natural decline in revenues of older games the quarteroverquarter decrease was mainly due to a seasonal downturn of revenues from tlbb around chinese new year holidays in the first quarter of  as well as the natural decline in revenues of older games online advertising revenue was us million down  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter the yearoveryear decrease was mainly due to fewer games being marketed on the  website the quarteroverquarter decrease was mainly due to a seasonal trend in advertising typical of the first quarter cinema advertising revenue was us million increased  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter the yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter increases were a result of an active approach we took in acquiring more advertising resources internet valueadded services revenue was us million down  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter the yearoveryear decrease was a result of lower revenue from mobile internet products in the first quarter of  the quarteroverquarter decrease was a result of lower revenue from pc internet products in the first quarter of  now let me provide some more details about our financials from now on most figures discussed will be on nongaap basis as a reminder you can find a reconciliation of this nongaap measures now published financially ph nongaap gross profit was us million down  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter gross margin was  which compares with  in the first quarter of  and the  in the fourth quarter of  nongaap operating profit was us million which compares with us million in the first quarter of  and us million in the fourth quarter of  nongaap net income attributable to changyoucom limited was us compared with us million in the first quarter of  and us million in the fourth quarter of  nongaap fullydiluted net income attributable to changyoucom limited per ads was us compared with us in the first quarter of  and us in the fourth quarter of  next moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow statements as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled us million compared with us million as of december   for the first quarter we had net operating cash inflow of us million finally for second quarter of  guidance we expect total revenue to be between us million and us million this implies a flat second quarter at high end or a sequential decrease of  at low end within total revenue online game revenue to be between us million and us million this implies a flat second quarter at high end or sequential decrease of  at low end nongaap net income attributable to chanyoucom limited to be between us million and us million nongaap fully diluted net income attributable to changyoucom limited per ads to be between us and us sharebased compensation expense to be around us million assuming no new grants of share based awards and that market price of our shares as unchanged in our guidance we have adopted a presumed exchange rate of rmb to us as compared with actual exchange rate of approximately rmb to us for the first quarter of  as dewen mentioned before our second quarter guidance exclude the impact of legacy tlbb mobile games due to revenue uncertainties inherent at that time this concludes our prepared remarks thank you for joining the call today operator we would now like to open the call to questions questionandanswer session certainly thank you operator instructions we’ll pause just for a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal we will now take our first question which comes from alicia yap of citigroup please go ahead q  alicia yap hi good evening thanks for taking my questions i have two quick questions number one is related to the tlbb legacy what is the remaining improvement or the update that you need to change for the game before the open beta test and do you expect tlbb legacy to attract your existing tlbb d user as well as the tlbb pc user and among your testing sample do you know what is the percentage of the user from the existing tlbb user base thank you dewen chen foreign language  chinese interpreted okay just onto the first question we have now less than one month before the official launch of the game and game is pretty much close to completion we are just making incremental improvements on the details such as fonts the dialogs and notifications within the game so we weren’t expect any significant changes between now till the official launch so we shouldn’t see much delay in the actual launch date to answer the second question from the test we’ve seen so far the most loyal have come tlbb pc players indiscernible very keen on trying new games they are happy being own game so the new legacy tlbb mobile game is really targeted towards those who have left those are the ones who have shown the most interest in trying out that actually tlbb mobile games in terms of tlbb d it’s more like the actionbased rpg game so there is very much overlap between tlbb d and the legacy tlbb and so far from the results we’re seeing there shouldn’t be too much effect on tlbb d but we wont know until the new legacy tlbb mobile game is actually launched thank you alicia yap okay great thank you operator thank you we’ll now move to our next question which comes from zoe zhou of credit suisse please go ahead zoe zhou hi management thank you for taking my question i have two questions first of all on the decline of tlbb d active monthly accounts it was down by  this quarter do we see any impact from the competition such as tencent’s honor of kings et cetera during chinese new year and the second question is regarding the decline of ’s revenue what do we think about the implications from here does this decline mainly come from the big game titles or the smaller ones thank you dewen chen foreign language  chinese interpreted that was dewen i’ll just translate the first question so in the disclosed metrics for mobile games it’s actually a combination of all our games including those that were launched in q last year for those new games the metrics declined fairly quickly and that’s why you’re seeing a fairly rapid downward trend in a disclosed metrics and for tlbb d itself the metrics has declined a little bit over because of chinese new year holidays so in terms of the revenue first quarter was fairly flat compared to the previous quarter and we expect second quarter revenue to be flat as well the reason why we are seeing a downward trend for  is most of advertisers on  are pc games and then as the pc game market continues to decline we are seeing declining revenues for  but we are shifting  in the third quarter of this year we are shifting our strategy towards mobile games thank you zoe zhou okay thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions we’ll now move to our next question which comes from natalie wu of cicc please go ahead natalie wu hi good evening management thanks for taking my question two questions here the first one is regarding the margin profile so regarding the gross profit margin of tlbb pc and tlbb d respectively is the gross profit margin relatively stable for both these games and wondering if management can share with us some color on the like gross profit margin of the two games respectively and also for the tlbb legacy… dewen chen hello operator it appears that ms wu has actually disconnected maybe from the call we’ll just move to the next question that comes from hillman chan of macquarie please go ahead hillman chan hi management thank you for taking my question regarding the beta testing of legacy tlbb in march i’m excited to hear that the result has improved greatly from the previous round ph is there any way that wei qing can quantify the improvement be it the game participation user retention or the ingame spending by users and then i have another followup question foreign language  chinese wei qing foreign language  chinese hillman chan and my second question is regarding the pipeline  sorry unidentified company representative hillman let me translate the answer so in march our test results compared to the november test there was a huge improvement but unfortunately we cannot disclose the specifics but in terms of we’ve seen very good improvement across all our metrics including our second twoday retention rate sevenday retention rate day retention rate arpu paying ratio and lifetime value so what we can say is that the results met with our expectations and from now  between now to may we will still be making additional improvements and then we think there should be another upgrade from what we have seen now until the actual launch of the game thank you hillman chan thank you my another question is regarding the pipeline for indiscernible on management talk about the key titles in the pipeline in particular indiscernible with the tencent also new version of sword and fairy and also the pc title foreign language  chinese wei qing foreign language  chinese interpreted for qianjun ph we did one test in january with tencent and so now we are with combined doing more modification on the game so when we are ready we’ll probably do the next round of tests so we are doing another round of test on indiscernible and if everything goes well it should be launched by the end of this year and other games are still under development and testing so overall we have about  games that’s on the development right now so we have very high expectations for the quality of the games so it’s more important that we rollout high quality games than the number of games that we launch in a year thank you hillman chan foreign language  chinese operator thank you operator instructions we’ll now move to our next question which comes from han joon kim of deutsche bank please go ahead han joon kim great thank you very much for the questions you’ve mentioned that your aim is to stabilize the tlbb pc side can you just give us a perspective on what you think the kpis should look like and how close you are to stabilization i think you mentioned second quarter should be down a little bit but does that mean that progressively into q and q we should be flat lining from there forth or how much further room do we have to report if we reach a soft landing thank you dewen chen foreign language  chinese interpreted so the tlbb pc game is in its tenth year of operation and the pc market has evolved so much over the last few years so what the numbers that we look at is the active  the number of active users and how active they are in the game so overall we think the rate of migration from pc game to mobile games has actually slowed down this year compared to the previous years so as a result retaining these users and keeping them within the game is most important kpi for us rather than increasing arpu for those users thank you hello operator thank you we’ll now move to our next question which comes from thomas chong of boci thomas chong hi thanks management for taking my questions i have two quick questions my first question is about our overseas strategy can management give us some color about which countries do we target first and our expected revenue contribution and secondly we see we are having more closer relationship with tencent and are we open to any strategic investment thanks dewen chen foreign language  chinese interpreted so the target countries as part of our overseas expansion plan is north america and europe and mostly the englishspeaking countries and the reason for that is more than half of our web games revenue from road  when we still had road came from overseas market and then we also saw some great success in some of our peer companies that’s making overseas markets and also in terms of the size of market for north america is very similar to china so second question there is no talks related to what wei just mentioned thank you thomas chong thank you operator thank you operator instructions we’ll now move to our next question which comes from nancy wu ph of cicc please go ahead natalie wu hi is that me operator yes please go ahead natalie wu hi yes this is natalie sorry it’s me again my line just got like cut off just now so actually i still have a second question regarding the tlbb legacy so as it is recorded on net revenue basis so can we assume that the majority of that game to be recorded can be transformed to net profit line so which means that net profit margin for this game would be very high would it be great if management can help us understand the rough margin level of the new game to be launched jasmine zhou hi this is jasmine unidentified company representative foreign language  chinese jasmine zhou for legacy tlbb mobile game i think the margin will be improved because as a net basis but for starting from q we will have get prepared for some new games we launched as second half of the year so we will have more spending in marketing just that will be partially offset the positive impact of that margin and for q we’re expecting actually the margin will be remain stable natalie wu thank you jasmine so just a quick followup with the rd expenses for this quarter for the first quarter the rd expenses declined over  in terms of absolute number so just wondering is there any kind of streamlining going on with the company and what should we expect of the headcount of each department this year dewen chen foreign language  chinese interpreted we don’t have any plans for further headcount reduction and the reason why you saw a decline this quarter was because of reduction in bonus expenses natalie wu got it thank you operator thank you that concludes today’s qa session i would now like to hand it back to your speaker margaret shi for any closing or additional remarks margaret shi once again i would like to thank you for joining today’s call if you have any followup questions please don’t hesitate to contact us thank you
