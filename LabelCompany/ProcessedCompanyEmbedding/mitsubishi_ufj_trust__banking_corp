the japan physical precious metals etfs series name “fruit of gold” backed by physical gold platinum silver and palladium stored in japan the  precious metals etfs will be listed on the tse on july nd    the japan physical precious metals etf “fruit of gold” series will be the first precious metals based etf to use beneficiary certificates issuing trusts mechanism prescribed after the revision of the trust act in  as the etfs will be backed by physical metals stored in japan and will utilize and integrate mutb’s japan’s largest trust bank expertise on the trusts business and mc’s precious metals procurement and global trading capabilities   the “fruit of gold” series of etfs which are linked to price indexes expressed in yengram will not only allow investors to trade from just one unit but will also allow investors that meet a certain criteria to trade in their certificates of beneficiary interest for the respective physical metal which is a new and never before seen concept   precious metals are essential resources not only for the jewelry sector but for japan’s industrial sector as well the “fruit of gold” series etfs not only allow investors to trade in their
