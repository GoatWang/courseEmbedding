sterilization and disinfection and is more particularly directed to a method and device for disinfecting rooms and similar enclosed areasbackground of the inventionnosocomial or hospital acquired infections are common costly and sometimes lethal a recent review of such infections in the cardiac surgery unit of a major hospital revealed a nosocomial infection rate of  that more than doubled the mortality rate for afflicted patients the nature of bacteria acquired in the hospital setting differs significantly from bacteria found in a community setting primarily in their resistance to antibiotic therapy “historically staphylococci pseudomonads and escherichia coli have been the nosocomial infection troika nosocomial pneumonia surgical wound infections and vascular accessrelated bacteremia have caused the most illness and death in hospitalized patients and intensive care units have been the epicenters of antibiotic resistance acquired antimicrobial resistance is the major problem and vancomycinresistant staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen of greatest concern the shift to outpatient care is leaving the most vulnerable patients in hospitals aging of our population and increasingly aggressive medical and surgical interventions including implanted foreign bodies organ transplantations and xenotransplantation create a cohort of particularly susceptible persons renovation of aging hospitals increases risk of airborne fungal and other infections significant morbidity mortality and costs are associated with these infections many factors contribute to these dangerous infections most notably is the overuse of antibiotics and poor personal hygiene such as hand washing abundant evidence exists however that the hospital environment itself contributes to the problem by harboring virulent strains of bacteria fungi and viruses and that many methods commonly used are ineffective and may actually spread contaminantsattempts to eradicate surface contaminates from the hospital setting have varied greatly in strategy and success these have ranged from antiseptic soaps to fumigation with formaldehyde gas topical antiseptics are problematic for several reasons first they have recently been shown to actually induce antibiotic resistances and thus may be adding to the problem secondly many surfaces such as keyboards television sets and monitoring controls are difficult if not impossible to decontaminate with liquid disinfectants without harming the electronics gas disinfection while effective is time consuming hazardous to workers and environmentally unwiseultraviolet uv light has been long used for disinfection and sterilization ultraviolet light may be produced artificially by electricarc lamps recently the widespread availability of low to medium pressure mercury bulbs has led to the development of devices which use uvc to decontaminate water supplies uvc is a high frequency wavelength of light within the ultraviolet band and has been shown to be the most bactericidal type of ultraviolet light uvc has wavelengths of about  å to  å to date there are no published efforts to use uvc to decontaminate or disinfect larger areas such as operating rooms the only recent availability of the appropriate bulbs as well as significant safety concerns regarding worker exposure to uvc likely contribute to the lack of efforts to use uvc outside of selfcontained water purification systemssummary of the inventionan ultraviolet area sterilizer or disinfector for use where concern exists regarding the presence of pathogens on environmental surfaces ultraviolet c uvc generators generate uvc radiation that is directed into an enclosed area the direct and reflected uvc radiation kills pathogens in the enclosed area the device transmits a calculated dose of uvc radiation in the enclosed area once an effective cumulative dose of uvc radiation has been reflected to radiation sensors as measured by the sensors the device shuts down the device allocates power to specific uvc emitters so as to direct uvc radiation more uniformly throughout the area as measured by the sensorsdescription of the drawingsfig  is

fixture that incorporates uvc bulbsfig b shows the fixture of fig a with louvers in an open position for actuation of the bulbsfig  is a schematic of a pulse width modulation control of a light emitting diode led uvc bulbdetailed description of the preferred embodimentthe examples given in the discussion of preferred embodiments are fixtures to buildings or rooms to buildings however the elements of the device as described herein may also be incorporated in a mobile device that is portable as described in deal us pat no  the power allocation device and method as described herein is useful with fixed and portable devices and methods of ultravioletc uvc disinfectionreferring now to the drawing figures banks of uvc emitting bulbs  are positioned in an architectural partition which could be a wall but may be a ceiling  of the enclosed area the enclosed area may be a room located in a building fig in one embodiment four  pairs of medium pressure mercury bulbs may be present in a fixture that is located in a ceiling of a room fig  the bulbs may be inch long watt uvc generating lamps or bulbs that produce  microwatts of ultraviolet radiation at  meter other effective uvc generators or bulbs may be used as will be understood by one skilled in the art the uvc generators or bulbs may be one or more arrays of light emitting diodes leds that emit uvc radiation each pair of bulbs is preferred to be positioned to provide coverage of specific portions of the entire room the lamps or bulbs may be positioned between ceiling tiles that are commonly used in commercial buildings including hospitals and medical clinics the lamps or bulbs may be positioned in a similar manner to fluorescent bulb arrays that are used as lighting in buildingsone advantage of using the bulbs in multiple fixtures with the fixtures affixed to walls andor ceilings of real property is that broad coverage of the room may be achieved with the uvc radiation emanating from multiple locations that are remote from each other and over a relatively large area optimal positioning of the bulbs according the requirements of the particular room may be achieved if a portable unit is used the dissemination of uvc radiation is limited to a radius around the machinea base such as a lighting fixture is provided for the lamps or bulbs the base or fixture may be positioned in the ceiling between ceiling tiles andor hvac outlets the lamps or bulbs are positioned to direct uvc radiation from overhead toward the room structure and toward furniture  fixtures  and equipment within the room the uvc radiation is reflected from surfaces in the room and particularly the flat and preferably light colored wall surfaces so that the uvc radiation is received both directly and indirectly by reflection to substantially all surfaces in the room surfaces that are not in a direct unobstructed line with the uvc emitters will receive uvc radiation in a dosage that is effective to achieve adequate disinfection of the room due to reflection from other surfaces in the room as measured by the uvc sensorsuvc sensors such as sensor a may be mounted in the ceiling such as in ceiling tiles and positioned so as to receive reflected radiation that is reflected from objects in the room or the walls and floors of the room without receiving material levels of uvc radiation directly from the uvc lamps that is one or more of the sensors may be mounted in the same flat planar architectural partition as the uvc bulbs or emitters so that the sensors do not receive direct radiation but rather they receive reflected radiation that is reflected from surfaces in the room the bulbs  are preferred to be recessed within a fixture and the sensor may also recessed within a ceiling or similar plane so that the sensor does not receive direct radiation from the bulbssensors may be mounted on fixtures or objects located in the room multiple sensors may be positioned in the room these sensors may be connected to controls by wire or by wireless communication none of the sensors shown in fig  receive a material dose of uvc radiation directly from the uvc bulbs sensors b and c are shown as being positioned under objects in the room such as beds tables or other furniture  equipment or fixtures these sensors are positioned so that they do not receive direct radiation from the uvc bulbs  similarly sensor a by being positioned in the ceiling does not receive direct radiation from the uvc bulbs but only such uvc radiation as is reflected to itin another embodiment the bulbs  are mounted below the ceiling but just below the ceiling the bulbs should be at least two  meters above the floor and it is preferred that the highest bulb is mounted not more than  centimeters from the ceiling in one embodiment the bulbs are mounted in one or more corners of the enclosed area or room and are positioned for maximum reflectivity toward the darkest corner of the room in an embodiment the bulbs are mounted in a room in a corner and just below the ceiling with the bulbs direct to a diagonally opposite corner of the room that is the darkest corner of the room the darkest corner of the room is the corner that is measured to receive the lowest level of reflected radiation if the run time of the bulbs as determined by the cumulative dosage received by the sensors exceeds a preset time limit then an additional bulb or bulbs spaced apart from other arrays of bulbs should be addedin one embodiment a sensor is mounted in the same corner of a room or enclosed area as an array of bulbs the sensor is positioned so as to not receive direct radiation the sensor is positioned within and surrounded by a surround which acts to shield to shield the receiver sensor from direct radiation but allows reflected radiation to be received this may be accomplished in one embodiment by placing the sensor in a tube with an opening in the end of the tube allowing the sensor to receive reflected radiationfigs a b a and b show an embodiment of uvc emitting bulbs  positioned in a light fixture the light fixture  may be mounted in a ceiling such as a light fixture that is positioned between ceiling tiles in this embodiment fluorescent light bulbs  of a type that are generally in use are also present in the fixture bulbs  provide visible light for lighting the room and may be operated by a wall switchuvc sensors  are present in the fixture  the sensors are preferred to be spaced apart from the uvc emitting bulbs and mounted in the fixture so that they receive uvc radiation that is reflected from surfaces in the room and particularly surfaces that are below the bulbs  and the sensors do not receive material levels of direct uvc radiation from the bulbsthe embodiment of the light fixture shown in fig  and fig  uses louvers  as a safety device to prevent inadvertent discharge of uvc radiation when people are in the room motion is detected or if objects are in the room that should not be present the louvers also protect the uvc bulbs and help discourage service or replacement by unauthorized personsthe covers or louvers  may be formed of an opaque material that prevents visible light and uvc radiation from passing through alternatively the covers or louvers may be formed of a material that is substantially transparent or translucent to visible light but prevents or filters uvc radiation from passing through the coverin one embodiment the covers or louvers are movable and are movable in response to commands from the control system upon actuation of the device the louvers are moved by actuators from the position closed shown in figs a and a to the position open shown if figs b and b to reveal the bulbs and permit treatment of the room upon completion the actuators move the louvers to the enclosed position the actuators may be driven by electric motors which rotate a drive train to rotate the louvers from the enclosed position into the open position and back to the closed position solenoids may also be used to move the louvers a feedback device may be employed to provide open or closed louver status a louver interlock mechanism may be included to prevent accidental activation of the lampsif coverage of the room cannot be accomplished by arrays of lamps positioned in the walls the lamps or bulbs may be supplemented with lamps or bulbs positioned within the ceiling it is preferred that the uvc emitters are positioned overhead so that the lamps are not easily reached by persons in the room further positioning the lamps overhead gives the best chance of unobstructed emission of the uvc radiation and reflection of the radiation and particularly reflection from wall surfaces the lamps or bulbs are spaced apart as necessary to achieve uvc coverage that effectively kills pathogens in the room and within a reasonable time such as less than about twenty  minutes for an operating suite portable lamps or bulbs may also be used with the portable lamps positioned as required within the room the position of the portable lamps may be dictated by the position of furniture or equipment that is located or relocated within the roomin one embodiment a control box  contains a controller the controller is preferred to comprise components such as a microcontroller  and redundant control relays  motion detectors  door interlocks  or door strike controls  louver status  and audible  and visible alarms  are preferred to be employed for safety an embodiment of a control structure using a microcontroller is hereinafter describedreferring now to fig  door interlocks  are shown these interlocks are activated by the doors of the room in which the device is operating the door interlocks are switches which disable the device if any one of the switches is opened such as by opening the door door strike controls  would not allow the door to be opened while the device is activated optional motion detectors  are immediately monitored upon activation of the device and prior to powering of the ballasts  and the bulbs by means of a relay  if the motion detectors sense motion at any time during the operation of the device power to the ballasts and the bulbs is immediately disabledthe device may be controlled by a programmable microcontroller the controller may be a pic microcontroller  pic the pic may be contained in control box  pic® microcontrollers available from microchip technology inc of chandler ariz may be usedthe pic microcontroller continuously receives a voltage input from sensors such as sensors   which receive reflected uvc radiation although sensors receiving direct radiation may also be monitored upon initiation of the device the sensors continuously sense and measure the level of uvc radiation which is reflected back to the device it is preferred that the cumulative uvc radiation emission is measured from initiation of the emission to termination for each of the sensors ideally reflections from substantially all points in the room will be measured placement of the sensor and the number of sensors to be used will be determined by the size architecture and contents of the room for example eight or more sensors that are strategically positioned may be used wireless remote uvc sensors  may also be employed to monitor a specific area of concernif the device is ceiling mounted according to a preferred embodiment of the device at least one sensor will typically be positioned in the ceiling to receive reflected radiation from the bulbs that are directed away from the ceiling a sensor or sensors may be positioned in the lighting fixture but is preferred that the sensor or sensor be positioned so as to receive reflected radiation without receiving uvc radiation directly from the uvc bulbseach sensor converts the measurement of the level of radiation to a voltage output which is transmitted to the microcontroller such as the pic the pic samples the voltage received at intervals and adds the cumulative total of the voltage received when the pic determines that the reflected uvc radiation received by each and every sensor has reached the predetermined minimum cumulative total the pic causes the device to shut down and a signal is given to the operator that the process has been completed the pic is programmable to measure voltage inputs as required by the particular applicationthe pic receives commands from a control which may be a wireless remote control  or it maybe hardwired to the other operating components  the control may be mounted on a wall but should be mounted outside of the enclosed area or room to be treated so that the control can be operated without exposing the operator to uvc radiationa switch activates the remote control entry of a security code allows the operator to begin sending commands to the pic commands include activate shutdown enter sterilization mode or enter sanitize mode the remote is in twoway communication with the device and displays data from the sensor array time left to sterilize or sanitize the room and in case of bulb failure the status of all numbered bank of bulbs if twoway communication with the remote is lost the device shuts downthe pic monitors the motion detectors at least one minute prior to activation of the uvc bulbs and continues to monitor the detectors during the cycle the pic performs calculations regarding bactericidal doses stores cumulative dosing data adjusts or causes allocation of uvc emitter power levels andor emissions as required and conducts system checks to alert the operator of bulb failure this is needed since an operator should not look at the bulbs to check for burned out bulbs or damaged banks the pic can be reprogrammed by attaching a personal computer via a data bus connection thus allowing alteration to the algorithms to accommodate special circumstancesan example of a protocol for using an embodiment of the device is described an operator checks the room for occupants then leaves the room after securing the room the operator enters into the control a security code or password whereupon the operator is prompted to press an “on” switch on the control activating the device the audible voice alarms and the motion detectors activate and are preferred to stay on until the entire cycle has been complete should the device detect motion the device automatically deactivates itself until the operator reenters the room to clear the room thus preventing the operator from reactivating the device and harming an occupant present in the roomone or more motion detectors are monitored for a preset time such as one minute prior to opening the louvers and powering the uvc bulbs and then stay active until the cycle is complete the bulbs are powered down and the louvers closed the array of bulbs according to the embodiment shown in the drawings emits uvc radiation downwardly to at a preferred minimum angle of  degrees and more preferably at substantially  degrees from the array of bulbs so that working and occupied surfaces that are below the array of bulbs and are within the enclosed area are exposed to uvc radiation as seen in fig  all furniture fixtures and objects that are in a direct line with the bulbs  will receive direct radiationsensors are positioned so as to not receive direct output from the germicidal lamps thus measuring the dose of uvc reflected back to the sensors this data is fed into the microcontroller where it is integrated to compute cumulative exposure of uvc reflected back from each sensor in the arrayin one embodiment reflecting from the least reflective surface or direction the microcontroller calculates the time the device stays activated to allow an effective dose of uvc to be emitted within the enclosed area several thousand measurements or “snapshots” may be taken for computation of the cumulative dosageonce sufficient time for a lethal dose of uvc to be reflected back to the sensors has elapsed and the minimum cumulative dosage corresponding to each sensor is received by the corresponding sensor the device may power down the bulbs and sound an “all clear” alert to the operator if the device uses louvers or similar movable covers for the fixture then the louvers may move to a closed position that covers the uvc emitters or bulbsupon completion of the cycle the device is preferred to have disinfected all the exposed surfaces within the room including the primary shadows such as the back or wall side of rails cabinets which are not against the wall and tables surfaces not directly exposed to the uvc radiation may be sterilized by uvc radiation reflected from the walls and ceilingsin most environments there is a presence of what microbiology labs label as “wild spore forms” of bacteria these bacteria are not known to cause human disease and yet are resistant to low doses of uvc the dual programming modes of one embodiment of the device allow treatment as required one mode sanitize kills all known pathogens and requires a lower exposure and thus shorter time the other mode sterilize kills all species of bacteria and requires greater cumulative doses and therefore more timewithout adequate safety features daily use of intense uvc is dangerous and impractical the device may have motion detectors which assure the room is vacant of personnel prior to activation once activated the device shuts down instantly when motion occurs anywhere in the room being disinfected if the device loses twoway communication with the control panel it also shuts down in daily use safety protocols commonly used in hospitals such as those in use for laser and xray devices may be implementedthe device is able to sanitize or sterilize exposed surfaces in a room it is able to do so safely leave no residual toxins or radiation and generates no adverse environmental side products in addition the device is able to notify the operator of the time required to perform this task and automatically shuts down upon completion of sterilization the inventor has performed tests to prove the efficacy of the device all of which have been successful reflectivity of some paints and other surfaces which absorb rather than reflect uvc requiring prolonged exposures of twenty minutes or greater specially reflective paints are preferred to be included in the system of area sterilization presented by this inventionthe estimated reflection from the wall in a typical hospital room was only  reflection below three percent is not desirable since the increased exposure time required to achieve an effective dose may result in degradation of articles which are present in the room and which are exposed to direct uvc radiation a minimum of five  percent reflectivity is desired through the use of paint or coating that produces a painted wall reflecting  of the uvc the efficiency of the device is increased allowing for greatly decreased exposure timesuvc effectiveness depends primarily on the total dose delivered to the microorganisms and is often expressed as duvit where duv represents the total exposure or energy applied i is the average irradiance in microwattscm and t is the exposure time in seconds the survival fraction s of a microbial population exposed to uvc is an exponential function of dose expressed by the equation sekd in this equation d means the total energy to which a microorganism is exposed and k represents a speciesspecific deactivation or kill rate constant values for the k constant have been measured for a vast array of microbial species thus any modifications to the methods described which increase the intensity of uvc shorten the required exposure time the unique combination of highly reflective paints and other wall coverings with multiple uvc emitters controlled as previously described potentially creates an effect wherein energy is added to the area nearly as fast or faster than it is being absorbed this recurrent reflection effect boosts the total uvc available to expose pathogens within the room in an accelerating nonlinear fashion where the above formulas no longer apply sufficient uvc intensity results in microsteam bubbles within the nuclei of pathogens and almost instantaneous death by irreversible dna damageit is preferred to have the walls of the room and other painted surfaces in the room covered with paint or a similar coating the paint or coating should have uvc reflectivity enhancing materials which may be pigments in the paint  the reflective particles or pigments may be colorants in one embodiment the coating includes particles of barium sulfate that will reflect the uvc radiation this coating may be transparent to the naked eye and used to cover painted surfaces such as painted walls or cabinets in another embodiment aluminum oxide is used as a pigment that will enhance reflectivity of the uvc radiation it is preferred that the paint or coating not have titanium dioxide in a form that absorbs ultraviolet radiation the paint or coating should be free of materials that are added to the paint or coating for the purpose of absorbing ultraviolet radiation reflective pigments such as aluminum oxide silver oxide or barium sulfate may be used in the paint or other coatingin one embodiment of the device which may be fixed to the building or portable each sensor is associated with a bank of bulbs and each bank of bulbs is powered by a variable output ballast each sensor converts the measurement of the level of reflected uvc radiation to a voltage output which is transmitted to the pic the pic samples the voltage received at intervals and adds the cumulative total of the voltage received from each sensor when the pic determines that the reflected radiation received by a particular sensor is lower on average than the other sensors the power from the variable ballast of the associated bulbs is increased at the same time the power from the ballast whose associated sensor is receiving the highest reflected dose is reduced in proportion this protocol is repeated such that each sensor receives the required cumulative dosage at approximately the same time while maintaining constant total ballast input power this embodiment provides an optimum sterilization rate for a given input power and prevents repeated over dosing of some areasin an embodiment that is similar to the one described immediately above the bulbs are uvc emitting light emitting diode led arrays that receive direct current from a pulse width modulated power supply fig  a driver  modulates such as a rapid onoff the direct current applied to an array of leds  the frequency and dutycycle of the pulse width modulation pwm can be independently varied by the pic so that the level of uvc emission over a given period of time may be varied there may be a plurality or array of drivers and a plurality of arrays of leds when the pic determines that the reflected uvc radiation received by the sensors  is not in balance the pulse width modulated radiation emissions are adjusted to achieve a more uniform reflected dose this embodiment provides the optimum sterilization rate for a given input power and prevents repeated over dosing of areas as with the other embodiments when the predetermined level of radiation is achieved power is terminated the device may provide a signal to indicate that treatment is concluded  previous patent method and apparatus      next patent antimicrobial peraci  home search services communities help contact us
