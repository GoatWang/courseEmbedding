clark born  october  is a british philosopher and professor emeritus of philosophy at the university of liverpool clark specialises in the philosophy of religion and animal rights writing from a philosophical position that might broadly be described as christian platonist he is the author of  books including the moral status of animals  the nature of the beast  animals and their moral standing  gk chesterton  philosophical futures  and ancient mediterranean philosophy  as well as  scholarly articles and chapters in another  books he is a former editorinchief of the journal of applied philosophy – contents  background  education and career  lectures  work on animal rights  publications  notes  further reading backgroundedit education and careeredit clark was born in luton bedfordshire though the family came originally from shropshirestaffordshire his father d a r clark was an apprentice railway engineer who became a technology teacher and was later appointed principal of middlesbrough technical college now the university of teesside then principal of nottingham technical college now trent university his mother m k clark was a teacher and the daughter of samuel finney mp clark was raised in the anglican tradition after attending nottingham high school – he won a scholarship to balliol college oxford – graduating with a firstclass honours degree in greats classics in  followed by a fellowship at all souls – he was awarded his dphil in  brannon hancock writes that the philosophers arthur prior and sir anthony kenny had a great intellectual influence on clark at balliol while robin zaehner was one of his greatest influences at all souls after oxford he lectured in moral philosophy at the university of glasgow for nine years until he was appointed professor of philosophy at liverpool in  he retired from this post at the end of  he has also been a visiting professor at vanderbilt university and held an alan richardson fellowship at durham

has also delivered the scott holland lecture at the university of liverpool  the aquinas lecture at the university of oxford  the read tuckwell lecture at bristol university  the royal institute of philosophy lecture at the university of durham  and the aquinas lecture at the catholic university of leuven  work on animal rightsedit clark served on the british governments animal procedures committee a group that advises the home secretary on animal testing from  until  he has also been involved with the boyd group a think tank set up by researchers involved in animal testing and others who oppose it clark argues that the moral basis of humanism – that all human beings have equal moral status – is now so entrenched in theory if not in practice that we fail to consider what a radical idea it used to be he writes that behind this idea is the notion that human beings are in some way uniquely gifted perhaps with a share in the divine this humannonhuman divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation rather than as ends in themselves he writes that we now know nonhuman animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them he highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of god yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea namely that we ought not to treat nonhumans with radically less consideration than we treat humans he writes if species differences are only racial differences writ large and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment  we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to nonhumans he argues that this is often all that is meant by the claim that animals have rights what our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves the question before us is not simply how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain a wholly vacuous program nor yet what rights do

father d a r clark was an apprentice railway engineer who became a technology teacher and was later appointed principal of middlesbrough technical college now the university of teesside then principal of nottingham technical college now trent university his mother m k clark was a teacher and the daughter of samuel finney mp clark was raised in the anglican tradition after attending nottingham high school – he won a scholarship to balliol college oxford – graduating with a firstclass honours degree in greats classics in  followed by a fellowship at all souls – he was awarded his dphil in

has also been involved with the boyd group a think tank set up by researchers involved in animal testing and others who oppose it clark argues that the moral basis of humanism – that all human beings have equal moral status – is now so entrenched in theory if not in practice that we fail to consider what a radical idea it used to be he writes that behind this idea is the notion that human beings are in some way uniquely gifted perhaps with a share in the divine this humannonhuman divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation rather than as ends in themselves he writes that we now know nonhuman animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them he highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of god yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea namely that we ought not to treat nonhumans with radically less consideration than we treat humans he writes if species differences are only racial differences writ large and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment  we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to nonhumans he argues that this is often all that is meant by the claim that animals have rights what our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves the question before us is not simply how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain a wholly vacuous program nor yet what rights do creatures have before the community formulates them but how may we best order the communities social and global of which we are parts the answer i believe must lie in our taking seriously what we already know that more matters even to animals than their own plain or pleasure and

are in some way uniquely gifted perhaps with a share in the divine this humannonhuman divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation rather than as ends in themselves he writes that we now know nonhuman animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them he highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of god yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea namely that we ought not to treat nonhumans with radically less consideration than we treat humans he writes if species differences are only racial differences writ large and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment  we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to nonhumans he argues that this is often all that is meant by the claim that animals have rights what our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves the question before us is not simply how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain a wholly vacuous program nor yet what rights do creatures have before the community formulates them but how may we best order the communities social and global of which we are parts the answer i believe must lie in our taking seriously what we already know that more matters even to animals than their own plain or pleasure and

always have a job here                 because you can write pulitzer prizewinning columnist william raspberry is oftquoted as saying good english well spoken and well written will open more doors

bring it up here to make a simple point writing well is a valued talent not everyone possesses after being at att about eight years a buyout offer came along and i decided to take it my boss at the time dan allen son of thenceo bob allen who happened to grow up in my hometown did his best to talk me out of leaving dan assured me that i could have a job within att as long as i wanted how do you

to me over the years not only can i write well but im also able to take technical material and make it clear to a nontechnical reader ive done this with telecommunications att aerospace rolls royce finance sallie mae higher education several universities and for faithbased organizations writing well is a skill most dont possess sadly many believe because they know the alphabet have word processing software that automatically checks grammar and spelling and that they squeaked through english  in college that they can write and do so with clarity but many examples of poor and confused writing can be spotted in memos reports contracts on websites and even in newspapers bad writing abounds why because writing well takes skill talent and effort it takes great writing to accurately
