parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

to your computer while you’re surfing the internet the best way to protect your computer from unauthorised connections from the internet is to install a personal firewall there are several options on the market some of which are free mcafee symantec zone labs the firewall sits between your computer and the internet and acts as a security guard restricting what can enter and leave your computer at first the firewall may ask you what you want to allow in or out of your computer however it soon learns to make these decisions independently based on the decisions you make early on the most important point is never to allow anyone else to connect to your computer regularly use an antivirus product and keep it updated these products can also scan for spyware and adware the most common way to receive a virus is through an attachment to an email attachments may appear to be word documents spreadsheets or pictures but often contain malicious viruses if you use email at home you should use

kaspersky mcafee symantec zone alarm with any antivirus product it’s important to keep it up to date so to protect against new viruses that are released most commercial products such as mcafee kaspersky and symantec have a mechanism to update themselves automatically the free products typically need to be updated manually the antivirus product should also be scheduled to scan your computer regularly in order to detect and clean out any viruses do not open unsolicited emails with attachments these may contain a virus also if you receive an unwanted email saying reply to unsubscribe ignore it senders can use this to confirm your email address is valid  and are then likely to send you more emails review your “sent items” folder if it contains messages that have been sent without your knowledge your computer may have a virus or may have been compromised update your operating system windows mac and browser internet explorer firefox safari make sure your computer software has all the necessary security updates available from the vendor it’s best to ensure this is done automatically ensure no one has unauthorised access to your computer destroy or delete anything containing

onlinetelephone banking login credentials cheque fraud how does cheque fraud occur cheque fraud takes place when a fraudster uses a stolen or counterfeit cheque to pay for goods and services more than  of fraudulent cheques are stopped before any loss occurs but even so cheque fraud still costs millions of pounds a year these losses can be compounded when the fraud also involves an ‘overpayment’ this occurs when the fraudster – who is often part of an organised gang – targets the seller of a highvalue item such as a car and offers to pay using a stolen or counterfeit cheque made out to more than the price of the goods once the cheque clears the victim is asked to transfer this ‘overpayment’ to a third party as well as handing over the item to the fraudster when the real cheque owner discovers that money has been stolen from his or her account the victim can be obliged to repay the total sum – even if this happens several weeks later how to protect yourself against cheque fraud don’t accept cheques from anyone unless you know and trust them especially when a highvalue cheque is involved be aware that there’s a risk that money credited to your account from a cheque could be reclaimed if the cheque turns out to be stolen or counterfeit always consider other ways of accepting payment for highvalue items – a chaps payment or guaranteed sameday bank transfer is ideal be especially wary if the buyer is unwilling to pay or split the relatively small cost involved with you keep your chequebook in a safe place report any missing cheques to your bank immediately always check your bank statements thoroughly what should i do if ive fallen victim to cheque fraud contact us immediately if you think you are or may be a victim of fraud on your investment account investec

computer where the attempt is made if it looks suspicious such a device you have never used before yahoo mail can require more than just your password but you must have enabled twostep authentication if you have enabled twostep authentication a second step is necessary to complete login this can be a code sent to your mobile phone or answering security questions you can also turn off the latter and require only mobile phone verification the yahoo mail account is then as secure as your password and access to your mobile how to protect your account with twostep authentication to add a second layer of authentication for suspicious login attempts from a new country for example to your yahoo mail account hover the mouse cursor over your name or icon in the top yahoo mail navigation bar select ‘account info’ from the menu if prompted type your yahoo mail password under ‘password’ click on ‘sign in’ under ‘signin and security’ follow the ‘set up your second signin verification’ link under ‘further protect your account’ make sure ‘check this box to turn on the second signin verification’ is checked if you already have a mobile phone number associated with your account click on ‘use current phone’ to use it for twostep authentication or click on ‘use new phone’ to use a different phone number please note that the form on this page may not allow you to enter phone numbers in all the countries yahoo can actually deliver verification codes to you can add those mobile numbers on your account see below if you have not yet set up a mobile phone number or chose ‘use new phone’ enter your phone number under ‘second signin verification setup add mobile phone’ click ‘receive sms’ type the verification code received at the number under ‘enter code’ the code is not casesensitive click on ‘verify code’ to request sms message verification under ‘your second signin verification is turned on’ choose ‘use only my mobile phone number for verification’ for a twostep authentication with a password and security question you can choose ‘use either my security question or mobile phone number for verification’ twostep authentication will only apply when you are accessing through the website not when you are using an app on your phone or pc how to add a mobile number not recognised on the twostep verification form to set up a new mobile phone number for recovering access to yahoo mail click your name or avatar in the top yahoo mail navigation bar select ‘account info’ from the menu follow the ‘update passwordreset info’ link under ‘signin and security’ click ‘add another under mobile numbers’ enter your mobile phone number click the country code to pick a different one click on ‘save’ hotmail to enable twostep authentication visit the httpsaccountlivecom and then navigate to httpsaccountlivecomproofsmanage here you will see a link to set up twostep verification please note you cannot have other microsoft accounts linked to the microsoft account you are trying to enable twostep authentication for if you do you will be prompted to unlink the accounts there is a short wizard all you really need to do is be contacted via one of the alternate methods you previously supplied for example a second email address microsoft will send a code to that account with the message “we need one more way to make sure you’re you” when you enter the code it enables the twostep verification use twostep authentication twostep authentication is used in two ways  a security code or an app password put simply whenever you need to sign into anything with your microsoft account credentials username and password try doing so normally if it works great otherwise you could be prompted to enter a security code if not you will need an app password security code if you have signed into windows  with a microsoft account and trusted the pc you would have seen the security code prompt ‘microsoft will send a text message to your mobile phone that contains this code’ you must then enter that code on the website or in windows or wherever you are prompted that is one form of twostep authentication  your microsoft account credentials plus the security code app password you can now also create an app password for those apps or devices that do not work with the security code system one example is microsoft outlook  if you had previously configured outlook for hotmail or outlookcom and then configured the underlying microsoft account the next time you use the application you will be prompted to enter your credentials again your normal password will not work  you need an app password you can generate an app password at the httpsaccountlivecom again from httpsaccountlivecomproofsmanage just tap the link ‘create a new app password’ under app passwords when you do you’ll be provided with an app password that you can type or copy and paste into the application this also works from mobile browsers like the one on windows phone this is handy because you may run into this issue with mobile apps as well you can then use the phone’s copy and paste capability to get the app password into the mobile app that’s not authenticating properly against your microsoft account authenticator mobile app when you need to generate a security code but have no cellular coverage for example when you are flying microsoft provides a mobile app called authenticator that can generate these codes in offline mode you need to configure the authenticator app to work with your microsoft account visit httpsaccountlivecomproofsmanage on httpsaccountlivecom but this time click the ‘set up’ link under authenticator app in the next screen you will be prompted to pair your phone with your microsoft account using a bar code tag in the authenticator app on windows phone tap the add  app bar button to add your account then tap the ‘scan’ button that resembles a camera icon to scan the bar code the app will quickly scan the bar code and then generate a code that you can type into the web page then click the ‘pair’ button to complete the process going forward the app will generate a new code automatically every  seconds if you ever need to use a code to sign into your microsoft account and your phone is offline you can use this app to get the code companies not connected to the investec group it has come to our attention that members of the public are receiving
