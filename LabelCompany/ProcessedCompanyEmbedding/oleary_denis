attitude the same clothes he touches on almost all of the same themes leary even invokes jim fixx when asked about this hicks told the magazine i have a scoop for you i stole his learys act i camouflaged it with punchlines and to really throw people off i did it before he did at least three standup comedians have gone on the record stating they believe leary stole hicks material comedic persona and attitude one similar routine was about the band judas priest during which hicks says i dont think we lost a cancer cure during learys  comedy central roast comedian lenny clarke a friend of learys said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from bill hicks with the message wish i had gotten these to you sooner this joke was cut from the final broadcast the feud is also mentioned in cynthia trues biography american scream the bill hicks story leary was in montreal to host the nasty show at club soda and colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she

left the dressing room according to the book true said upon hearing a tape of learys album no cure for cancer bill was furious all these years aside from the occasional jibe he had pretty much shrugged off learys lifting comedians borrowed stole stuff and even bought bits from one another milton berle and robin williams were famous for it this was different leary had practically line for line taken huge chunks of bills act and recorded it in a  appearance on the opie and anthony show comedian louis ck claimed that leary stole his im an asshole routine which was then expanded upon and

feel good guide to staying fat loud lazy and stupid leary wrote there is a huge boom in autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumbass kids cant compete academically so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons i dont care what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you — your kid is not autistic hes just stupid or lazy or both in response to the controversy leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted overdiagnosis of autism which he attributed to american parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and underperformance later he apologized to

needed controversyedit allegations of plagiarismedit for many years leary had been friends with fellow comedian bill hicks when learys comedy album no cure for cancer was released many people believed leary had stolen hickss act and material the friendship ended abruptly as a result in april  the austin comedy news remarked on the similarities of learys performance watching leary is like seeing hicks from two years ago he smokes with the same mannerisms hicks recently quit he sports the same attitude the same clothes he touches on almost all of the same themes leary even invokes jim fixx when asked about this hicks told the magazine i have a scoop for you i stole his learys act i camouflaged it with punchlines and to really throw people off i did it before he did at least three standup comedians have gone on the record stating they believe leary stole hicks material comedic persona and attitude one similar routine was about the band judas priest during which hicks says i dont think we lost a cancer cure during learys  comedy central roast comedian lenny clarke a friend of learys said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from bill hicks with the message wish i had gotten these to you sooner this joke was cut from the final broadcast the feud is also mentioned in cynthia trues biography american scream the bill hicks story leary was in montreal to host the nasty show at club soda and colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old hicks riffs including his perennial jim fixx joke keith richards outlived jim fixx the runner and health nut dude the plot thickens when leary came offstage colleen more stunned than angry said hey you know thats bill hicks material do you know thats his material leary stood there stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room according to the book true said upon hearing a tape of learys album no cure for cancer bill was furious all these years aside from the occasional jibe he had pretty much shrugged off learys lifting comedians borrowed stole stuff and even bought bits from one another milton berle and robin williams were famous for it this was different leary had practically line for line taken huge chunks of bills act and recorded it in a  appearance on the opie and anthony show comedian louis ck claimed that leary stole his im an asshole routine which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by leary on a later episode of the same show leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he leary cowrote the song with chris phillips autismedit in his  book why we suck a feel good guide to staying fat loud lazy and stupid leary wrote there is a huge boom in autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumbass kids cant compete academically so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons i dont care what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you — your kid is not autistic hes just stupid or lazy or both in response to the controversy leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted overdiagnosis of autism which he

attitude the same clothes he touches on almost all of the same themes leary even invokes jim fixx when asked about this hicks told the magazine i have a scoop for you i stole his learys act i camouflaged it with punchlines and to really throw people off i did it before he did at least three standup comedians have gone on the record stating they believe leary stole hicks material comedic persona and attitude one similar routine was about the band judas priest during which hicks says i dont think we lost a cancer cure during learys  comedy central roast comedian lenny clarke a friend
