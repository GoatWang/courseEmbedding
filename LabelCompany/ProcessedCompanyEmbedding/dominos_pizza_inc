for beverage also was very hard to understand on the phone also forgot icing for desert wont order again untill they are able to provide the service i expect from domonos wich i love so much called manager and he said he will give free breads and icing thanks dominos if being the worst dominos was a competition look no further as you have found the world champion past  orders arrived late and today was the last i ordered around pm and after seeing the tracker go to being checked for quality and being reset  times i had enough i was calling from pm since i missed a call from them someone finally answered angrily at pm  minutes to answer a freaking phone  i asked them to cancel my pizza and the guy goes off on me i ended up ordering from a local startup pizza company called zume pizza highly recommend  minutes later viola hot pizza at my door and cheaper had this been only once i understand things happen however this is systematic an hour plus if you are lucky for a cold soggy poor excuse for a pizza toppings are few and far in between the cheesy bready tasted like dough and was undercooked i can literally write a book about how bad this place is and how not to run a business bottom line the reviews dont lie avoid this place like the plague based on the last  times i ordered from this store i am not ordering from them again their motto should be slow cold and crappy the toppings are applied in a miserly fashion the delivery slow as heck and the food arrives cold the last time the food was late i dialed the store number and it was disconnected i was about to order from another place when my cold crappy pizza finally arrived note dominos customer service is nonexistant problem call the store kind of hard to do when the phone was disconnected failure on so many levels why dominos even gave these people a franchise escapes me we placed a pickup order instead of delivery taste was ok dont seem to care or understand the need for service though felt like bunch of buddies having good time and dont want to see any customers needless to say not going back there are so many decent pizza places looks else where  if you want your pizza to be late and cold order here i order in advance a pizza to be delivered at pm on a friday i placed the order at pm pm and nothing i called at  and no answer i called again at  and no answer i then proceeded to the store all the way from my house to the store i was callind and nobody answered when i arrived at the store the phone was ringing non stop and there were other  persons angry because their delivery never arrived the manager seemed careless all the time rhat i was there the phone just kept ringing the nobody answer nobody apologized easily one of the worst managements that ive ever experienced this dominos is great order online if you can as you can get more coupons this way who was open thanksgiving day when we had nothing to eat this place was handling the many others like us who had a thanksgiving food emergency like a boss and not only that they always pay attention to my requests if i add in to say i want them to go light on the cheese online ordering it will be lighter if i say extra anything i will definitely see extra havent had dominos since i was in college and that was xx years ago but my college aged daughter had a craving so we ordered medium cheese and medium pepperoni pizzas we ordered them online and was pleasantly surprised to be able to track the progress of our order how cool the pizzas arrived in about  mins and were still warm the crust was a bit thinner than that from pizza hut or mountain mikes but it had some kind of seasoning that added a good flavor both were fine in terms of flavor though none jumped out in terms of a memorable flavor profile but hey you cant beat the cost  each terrible service had to stop ordering from here one pizza was two hours late made the mistake of ordering from them again i ordered a pizza with no cheese it arrived late covered in cheese the delivery guy took it back and said i would get a refund a few minutes later the manager calls me and says that he wont give me a refund because i didnt say no provolone he agreed that i had said no cheese but because there were different kinds of cheese it was my fault guess i should have said no provolone no parmesan no gouda no swiss no cheddar no brie ridiculous the manager was incredibly rude this dominos used to be decent its gone off the rails bad in the last couple years burned pizzas long wait times has been the average today we ordered pizza for delivery and the app said  mins thats reasonable honestly we live about  mile from this dominos anyway  mins later the app says that my driver is on the way great i cant believe this is going so well  mins after the driver left i call the store to make sure everything is okay the woman who answered had no idea what i was saying and kept repeating the same thing to me which wasnt even relevant to my inquiry she clearly doesnt speak english okay no problem i asked to speak to someone that can help me im out on hold for  minutes my pizza doesnt show up during this time either im now at the local drive thru because i dont know whats gone on regarding my order this crazy sounding man gets on the phone hes clearly operating outside of his ken in this restaurant he says im sorry we didnt have your phone number right do you still want your pizza i laughed and asked if he meant the pizza thats been getting driven around for  mins he said yea i said no thats ridiculous this store has the absolute worst service product and availability of any dominos ive ever experienced  not only is the time of order to delivery at least  hours every time the pizza arrives cold incorrect and leaves a huge disappointment when you call to inquire they give a round about answer tonights situation went as such  i ordered online with the  deal one pizza one salad they called  mins after i ordered to tell me they are out of salad i was understanding and said no problem ill just have another  topping pizza to which he replied sure that will be  i told him no way youre out of what i ordered you should replace it with something comparable we talked about it for a minute and he finally agreed but then it took  more mins to receive my order and it was over cooked cold and not tasty i asked the delivery person what happens at his store he shrugged and said  im not really sure i solemnly vow from this day forward to never order from this dominos ever again if you reader of the dominos comments cares at all about your reputation as a brand please consider taking a visit and possibly shutting it down also please do not respond with your standard bs link to make an online comment ive already done that i seriously cannot believe you are still in business the best pizza over here  love the way crew treat the customer  manager was so helpful in finding the deals  highly recommend  awesome food  awesome people  i took the time to sign up with yelp just to write a review for the worse customer service ive ever received i made an order at pm its pm am i not getting my order i am trying to call the store for over  minutes and nobody answers the phone i am very very disappointed please someone from corporate contact me back i just had the worst customer service experience at this location with a delivery ive called the corporate office and reported ive called my credit card to dispute the charge the pizza was burnt and over cooked i got some that was not buffalo chicken wings it took  calls to the store to before i finally spoke with someone who claims he was the manager on duty and refused to help get order right they didnt even bother to cut the pizza i get stuff happens and mistakes are made its how you handle the mistakes that can build brand loyalty and create an awesome experience for the customer thats business  worst customer service walked in asked about the promotion i had heard about online they deal me there isnt a deal i come home and remember thats its the  deal and see if they can honor it despite having paid  dollars in the store the manager is so rude and tells me he cant do anything i dont care about the  dollars as much as i am angered by there lack of customer service and rude attitude also the pizza is freezing cold and rubbery expect at least  hours for pizza delivery we got a cold pizza and an unapologetic delivery boy who left a dominos plastic bag in our driveway souvenir no one even bothered to pick up the phone terrible service dominos pizza  no more burnt our specialty chicken and super stingy with pizza toppings the website said even though we couldnt see the asiago cheese on the image of the pizza when we were building it on their website they promised to get it right we couldnt even see it in the end the absolute worst service on the planet i dont know why i keep ordering from here never again  your order will take at least  hours doesnt matter the time of day traffic etc plan for at least  hours  it will arrive cold  when you call in they will tell you your pizza is  minutes away  there is a bad accident delicious food  pizzas are fresh and awesome in taste  good environment  keep up the good work guys  what a joke not only rude but also unprofessional i called on a sunday night to order a large pizza with a side of jalapeños guess what i couldnt order a side i asked why and the person on the phone said they couldnt do that i asked to speak to a manager and he told me the same thing i started asking why and i was told because thats how it was so i called mountain mike pizza and got a pizza the way i wanted it with a side of jalapeños this location is an absolute nightmare order was late as hell driver tries to call after midnight because he was afraid to knock called the store manager tells me to foff because my order is canceled holy crap no pizza and now everything else is

realsunnyvale ca    i love pizza and they have variety of vegetarian options always get freshly prepared within  minutes typical dominos pizza soso quality slow as hell unhelpful staff no prices posted just really disappointed that their delivery driver parks in the handicapped parking space when he has two perfectly good legs to walk with terrible pr most horrible experience ever ordered via the app for pick up when arriving after being notified my order is ready for pickup the employee was in the phone with another customer he did not even recognize me or apologize for making me have to waithe just left me standing after three minutes he paused the call and asked what i wanted told him my name and asked if my order was ready he said two minutes and went straightback to the phone after two minutes a politely asked if there was any progress he than put the phone on hold again now having two angry customers he went back and talked to another guy looked around on shelves and than said we have not done your order yet can you wait five to ten minutes luckily i whose pay at pickup and not in the app so i walked out and went to another place this is restaurang is absolutely catastrophic do not order from here im blown away i order here  times a week well kiss that goodbye let me explain why i have experienced the following  hair in my pizza  the sketchiest and most inconsiderate delivery men  pizza that states on its wayarriving hr  min later  the kids that deliver always expecting tips  management not believing me  cc declining  when the newbies attempt a transaction  delivery of food mishandled  wings and breads always hard or cold  never knowing what to expect now if i were to show receipt of my transactions for proof most would be blown away i am appalled im done im absolutely positive this is the sole reason why there are horrible reviews and always a new person working  the owner i wont name names put the blame on me in regards to something and that was the straw on the camels back i always provide good feedback and tip but im looked at like a scum when i needed help heres to all my money wasted and mouth being kept shut i never thought this would happen please take action and clean up this restaurants long term issues next step bbb my long history of ordering through this store has come to an end they accidentally delivered the wrong pizza a few orders agoaccidents happen i get it when i brought it to their attention they agreed to deliver the proper pizza the next time i placed an order well today i called to get the pizza and a sandwich i expected to pay for the sandwich but an added delivery fee of really they are coming here to give me the pizza that i paid forincluding delivery howard manager was so rude i could hear him yelling that i have to pay for deliveryeven though i already paid for delivery of a pizza that they owe me got there early to take out a couple pizzas while waiting we watched one of the food preparers take a walk in order he did the money exchange then returned to making a pizza without washing his hands a minute or so later the delivery person came in the front door put his bag down and proceeded to cut our pizzas and box them again this guy didnt wash his hands either even after just arriving from somewhere outside theres a dominos down elcamino in mtn view a short distance away next time i decide to get dominos ill go there instead thanks for the late night pizza walking distance to the grand hotel where we stayed best drunk food  and cheap oscar and his co worker were very friendly and made our pizzas very quick  mins last time i order pizza from this placetwo times ive called for a pizza and they take an hour when i call to ask about the pizzas they always say it hasnt been an hour when clearly on my phone it says an hourthe workers are rude the worst dominos experience globally rude staff  stars badly treat customers suggest people to go to other outlets close by there is another dominos very close please go there tasty pizza fast preparation and most items are inexpensive this dominos pizza location is my second favorite pizza place in sunnyvale for big pizza chains only ie round table dominos pizza hut little caesars etc ive been coming here for years and have only had one negative experience which was rectified the same day the pizza ingredients are fairly good not the best but definitely not cheap tasting in my opinion the star of every pizza i order from this location is always the crust which is always buttery and garlicky since the pizza from this location is usually good and the prices cant be beat ill of course come back in the future as a side note my favorite pizza deal from this location is  for a large topping pizza monday through thursday they dont give out the deals as advertised the  large pizza deal with  toppings will cost  more if you choose chicken as the topping coz supposedly chicken is a premium topping never going back again  star as theres no option for  star there are other dominoes in el camino which are better than this one if i could give them no stars i would called in an order last night for delivery when my family and i started to eat the pizza i noticed hair in the melted cheese i called dominos and told them about hair in the pizza and the person who answered the phone was very rude and said there was nothing the can do about the hair in the pizza i asked to speak with a manager and he replied i am the manager i told him if theres nothing you can do then ill just have to contact corporate then he replied go ahead and call corporate i know where you live he shouldnt be a manager with this attitude and he also shouldnt be threatening his customers like that this is the last time im ordering from dominos i would give zero stars if i could i have been a customer of this store for more than a decade i have never been so poorly treated i ordered a pizza at  the tracker said that mohammed left the store with my order at  i called the store at  to see where it was as i live less than  minutes from the store i was told that it was on the way the store person said to have the driver call when he arrived but when he arrived at  he had no phone i gave him mine as i thought i was still on the line with the store but the store had hung up i called again and got a different person who said  minutes was normal for delivery and he could do nothing extremely unhappy i paid and took the pizza inside opened it up and found it was cold called the store again and the same man said too bad there was nothing he could do this was not decent customer service and dominos should be ashamed and the manager disciplined ive been ordering pizza from you guys for  years it takes us longer to decide what we want then it does for you to get here they dont skimp on or custom sausage garlic white sauce roasted red pepper spinach double garlic always pan style slice of heaven always in our heartshollenbeck horrible i am literally a five minute drive away from this place i dont have a car or else id go elsewhere the website showed my delivery left at  its now  and it isnt here and it says it was delivered  minutes ago i called and all the lady said was its on its way it left freaking awul update it just now arrived almost an hour after the driver leftits cold dry and there are eyebrow hairs in it with the roots visible and eveything so i cant even eat it i called and told the worker who answered and she kept saying no it isnt hair its oregano oregano does not look like brown eyebrow hair and she didnt see it herself so how can she say it isnt what it is arguing with the customer and now i have to go to school hungry and angry this place needs to be closed dont order anything from this place as bad as advertised took them more than mins just to deliver the pizza then delivery kid tries to tell me the order tracker isnt accurate and that he came straight over from the store mins down the street kid lied pizza didnt  it was lukewarm shame it would be great if they kept their pizza for pickup in a warm oven instead of on a cold rack they do seem to have a heat lamp so it keeps the box top warm lol most of the dominos i have used are great fast and service is decent this one has been the same a while back now the past couple orders have taken over and hr and half and the pizza is cold the driver spoke no english and could not give me an explanation and the manager at the store kept telling me the driver was almost there i live less than ten minutes from the store after writing to corporate i get a response from the manager saying i can have a free medium pizza first my original order i wrote about was a large with a side w delivery my response was oksome compensation is better than none told me it was linked to my phone number i call in to redeem my free medium pizza and get a response of this is only for pickup wowthis clarification was not given when i was offered the free pizza for the issue otherwise i would have said no thank you and asked for a refund on my original order and you can pick up the old pizza no help at this location either management or ownership change has turned them downhill and corporate isnt much help aside from sending it on the ownership honestly this was the best order from dominoes my fiance and i have ever had we ordered the chicken alfredo pasta the chicken habenero sandwich and a  piece hot wings requesting extra crispy  run thru the oven x so amazing not only was the order super hot but we could tell the ingredients were fresh and the chicken wings were the best weve both had they were juicy but just crisp enough on the outside the pasta and sandwich were both equally as great we are from san diego and have ordered from dominoes countless times from many locations over the years its usually between disappointing and pretty darn good this time it was the best whatever you guys did tonight do it again it was great thank you for a suprisingly good meal this was my goto place for years until they recently changed management so i had to change my review the new management is very stingy barely any toppings and only  package of parmigiana cheese for a large pizza when i called to complain they didnt seem to care i do not recommend this domino location domino’s pizza claimed this

was good service was decent second time i placed the order online i received no confirmation call when i called them my pizza was ready for pickup third time i called while in route a lady answered the phone and asked if i could hold i made the six minute drive parked ordered saw who i think was her making pizza on arrival went back to my car and still no one had answered the phone for almost  minutes overall the people are polite and the pizza is good they could do a little better though not sure why all the negative reviews yes there has been diffrent employees over the past few months but they really aint that bad i always order on the phone when im in the area and want a fresh hot pizza and they answer super quick my order is also always done in less than  minutes overall a good place staff are courteous and friendly the only downside is the lack of having a table in case you want to eat in there but the location is small pizza is always done right in my expirence my coworker and i ordered the chicken bacon ranch hot sandwich and it had hardly any meat we also ordered a pizza with italian sausage onions and mushroomsalso barley any toppings and the dough was gummy what a sad lunchdisappointed and will not be reordering from this location i used to love dominos i always wondered why they had such a poor reputation as their pizza is decent and reasonably cheap however i now realize that all the hate they get is very welldeserved they have some of the worst customer service i have ever seen i have lost all respect for dominos workers and the company as a whole ive never written a yelp review before but i was compelled to simply because of my recent experience with this dominos location i ordered two pizzas around midnight on memorial day i paid online with my card i was up all night waiting for my pizzas and they never came when i initially ordered online their website said the pizzas would be delivered in  minutes by am i had yet to hear from them according to their pizza tracker which would be great if it worked  but it doesnt and is completely annoying retarded bullshit they only put the pizza in the oven around am later around  am the tracker said the pizza had been delivered i went outside and called the store and delivery person multiple times to see what had happened as usual no response they never bothered to even contact me to telly my pizzas were not coming i paid for my pizzas and they never came i cant believe it dominos is run by a bunch of deceitful incompetent fuckers fuck fuck they choked more than the chokelahoma city thunder dominos can suck my dick so we ordered our pizza and when it got here the goods were missingmeat called in and tim was very polite and apologizei guess there was a miss understanding between the baker and the delivery guydelivery guy comes back and brings us a new pizza and apologize as wellthese guys work hard and aim to pleasethank you guysthis dominos team rock people working at this location have zero sense of customer responsibility i called them up twice on first call they placed me on hold the second i called for around  mins i thought they forgot about my phone call so i called them up again they put me on hold again the moment i call up this time they put me on infinite hold the elapsed time on my call kept increasing every second made me more infuriated and increased my curiosity as to what the heck is going on i had enough  picked up the car and drove to the location when i entered the location i was flabbergasted to witness that they paid no heed to whoever called and just paid them on infinite hold and never took their order this is blasphemy my call was still going on i showed the employee responsible for the location at that time my call status  it should elapsed time over  mins she says sorry we are busy i told her why didnt you tell me that over the phone she said oh i am sorry while i was there somebody called up and she did the same thing hi can you please hold i told her what exactly are you doing tell the person that you cant take his order its not gay hard but she didnt i took a screen shot of my call when it hit  mins mark i am post it here i asked the manager whats your name and she became defensive and even more rude she told me her name is mary i dont think she gave me her right name dominos can somebody reach out and give me an explanation on this ordered pizza from here for deliverythey gave us zero plates n no cheese n pepper dumbasses i gave  in cash as gratuity for a simple order  on  now having found out someone in dominos employ has committed forgery against the credit card receipt of that order im no longer feeling grateful if dominos would refund said  that would be great i had only thrown up once in my life first time drinking before i ordered the hawaiian pizza from dominos almost immediately i vomited three times every hour and a half for  hours sometimes the gagging would only bring up one piece of ham or pineapple sorry my body did not want any of it in my system get this i ordered a pizza on friday night i was told it would take  minutes to deliver after waiting for over  hours i gave up the pizza never came that night the next day i noticed that i was charged on my credit card i called dominos to get the charge reversed the lady said she could not do it and offered me store credit which i did not want she promised me a call back which never came today i called them and asked about my refund and the lady flat out hung up on me i am in shock stay far far away from this joke of a place ordered days ahead scheduled for  am pizza doesnt arrive until  worst of all i called and the manager was like i guess someone changed it when she was the one who took order dont recommend this location worst experience ever after waiting over an hour from when they said our order was on its way we called to inquire about where it was and were repeatedly hung up on by multiple employees left with no answers and our order never being delivered to the supposed manager david your employees should be fired for the way they treat your now former customers if you like mediocre pizza served with an attitude this is the place for you the woman at the front tried to argue with my coworker about a sauce that she ordered and they didnt put in the past  times i have been there customer service has been an issue there needs to be a customer service class taught to this location its getting ridiculous now worst f place i am east palo alto and i spoke to a lady that speaks spanish and no f delivery call one more time as soon as i checked map to se how long it takes  mins where i live that all it takes and when i called lady says no deliveries in palo alto an then hangs up phone trying to make business like that no please dont work if this how people are going to be treated never eating from this or order from this place the pizza from here is great they arent stingy with the toppings when i order light sauce they actually put light sauce super important to me the only complaint i have is when i pick up the pizza the employees usually take a while to attend me they might even look at me but continue what theyre doing i get it though theyre busy at least no one has been rude to me back home in hawaii i almost never go to dominoes because i dont care for their pizza but ive ordered delivery from this location twice in the past three days their pizza was seriously the best dominoes ive ever tasted in my life i ordered only  toppings and the pizza was covered perfectly with it the parmesan bread bites  hot wings were actually good too will definitely order from here again should the need arise just wanted to give a quick shout because i was nervous to order online from this delivery location with all the negative reviews but the experience couldnt have been better i ordered at  pm on a friday the order was perfect and arrived within  minutes maybe things at this location are turning around  the worst customer service i have ever received my order was messed up and i waited for a new pizza for over  hours but never received one when i reached out to the store i was put on hold and the call was cut immediately it happened  times and when i asked the woman not to put me on hold i was yelled at plus i was told that i would not get reimbursed for all the extra money i paid for my toppings but didnt receive this is not the first time this has happened with this store their sense of accountability is abysmal when asked to talk to the manager she got defensive and replied that she was the manager plus i was told good luck with taking any actions against the store or her never had such a terrible experience with any store given that it is in palo alto i expected better service dont order online we waited two hours for our pizza delivery and the order was incorrect we will not order at this location anymore wow made simple order online after  min getting phone from a driver who doesnt speak much english mumbles that he cannot find the address and he gives up yup calling the store the manager tells me to call back to the driver because it is not his problem now huh yeah ok this is probably the most dysfunctional dominos location i have ever encountered wouldnt order again from this place domino’s pizza claimed this

log in     caliente drsunnyvale ca    guy made a suggestion which helped me save money thank you the phone service is okay no enthusiasm but its okay its the bay area we talk to millions of people everyday it took  minutes pretty much the quoted time he said for the pizza to get her during the dinner rush it was good pizza  out the door for a large pizza with delivery the  deal is take out only i usually pick up but the wonderful thing about pizza is ever night is pizza night or can be and it can be delivered if needed and i was in a hurry they didnt my cell to let me know he was here but thats okay it was hot and delicious and alittle doughy but very good and the chicken slices on the pizza were pretty good not very tiny like some places i would suggest to everyone to save money go their in person or order online but the fastest way is to order over the phone and for delivery  thank you for making my dinner a lot of the in house experiences are true on yelp too so im not usually one to give a place such a poor rating but multiple times now i have ordered something and it came incorrect undercooked or overlooked ive always picked up a pizza and over heard the manager at the time yelling very rude things to his employee and he challenged me to fight he did not want it the reason im writing this review today is because i thought i made mistake last when ordering online but after reviewing my last order on their app they did in fact forget the tomatoes not to mention when the delivery driver arrived he complained about the tip and asked for more he forgot my napkins and shook his head when i gave him another dollar very unethical and very rude giving them one last chance tonight horrible horrible experience with dominosnever again ordering ever we made an online order at   and waiter for an hour and there was no pizza so when i called back they inform me that there was a new driver and he was at the apartment but did not know which building it was and tried to contact but it was a old number on my profile and hence could not reach me i mean come on you can ask the leasing office or anyone around its not that difficult so they promised to send it back again in  mins i waited another half an hour and still nothing so i called again and this time they state its on the way and will be there in  mins i wait for  more mins and still nothing this was for the kids and the order was place at   and now its  pm i mean this is heights of dominos attitude so i call them again and tell them you cannot be this late and even if you deliver it will be a cold pizza and and i will not need it he drops the calls so rudelythis is horrible horrible service i do not know if they will cancel the order and refund me please improve you customer experience otherwise there will not be people ordering from your store ever again worst service ever  i called to order a pizza and the guy wouldnt give me online prices said i had to order online he actually yelled at me saidthats what i said maam okay i did that i brought my pizza home and was so hungry and excited but when i bit into my pizza and it was horrible no garlic cream sauce no flavor i ordered extra red sauce on tbe other no flavors just bad all together tasted like tomato paste on bread i called to tell the guy and he argued with me and then said he would get his manager for me insteadhe hung up on me sorry never again im so disappointed i went to dominoes because the commercials claim they use fresh products i could have bought a better frozen pizza live in the neighborhood and have never had a bad experience with this dominos theyre always on time and have never messed up an order aside from the occasional missing dipping sauce so im not sure where all the negative reviews are from the pizza has gotten a lot better in recent years and im always happy to order it dumbass employees do not know what theyre doing every time i order from here they always act like they have no clue what theyre doing on the phone they also took an hour   minutes to deliver a medium pizza wow lmfao they are known for delivery in the past its been pretty good this time the driver left without my pizza the application showed my pizza was delivered driver called me to give me the bad news called the store they had no idea so im guessing the pizza was delivered to the wrong address manager offered a free pizza called  minutes later and they had not even started making the pizza manager put my pizza at the back of the bus dont use these guys they will lose your pizza had to cancel the order if you download the app you can order a medium topping pizza for around  i usually get the pan crust with white sauce and it lasts me a couple days worth of meals i will say that even though theyre gracious with the cheese they skimp on the toppings but its fast cheap nearby and the employees are always friendly and in spite of my preference for small businesses over franchises its a nice indulgence every so often im not trying to be contrary here but everyone one with the star reviews on this location are just mad about the terrible delivery service the pizza itself isdominosno surprises there i agree dont order delivery from here if you are expecting a timely deliverybut if you treat this place as a pickup only location i think you will be well served call in give them your order and they get it done quickly even on the busiest friday the most i had to wait for pick up was  minutes usually they have it ready in less than  min the people who work here are really nice folks tryin to make an honest living and the food quality is fine plus its cheap worst chicken pizza everchicken pieces was hard and raw and looks like way way old haters gonna hate but this location has delivered nothing but excellence loyal like family they have given me great delivery and delicious pizza thats all love you guys put in an order for a party and requested square cut slices dominos website allows this in its online order system however when i got the pizzas the slices were radial instead of offering a replacement for this the associate just wanted me to take the cut pizzas as is will never use the sunnyvale caliente st location again driver was polite but pizza arrived  hr and  minutes after order quoted  min your online dominos tracker said that the pizza had been delivered  minutes before it actually was i tried to call the location and was hung up on twice after being put into queue never being talked to stay away pizza people this review is solely based on their delivery service my boyfriend and i ordered pizza online we noticed it was taking longer than usual for the pizza to get to the door so we checked the status online the status said the pizza was out the door at  pm fast forward an hour later and we have still yet to get our pizza i understand that maybe the driver is making multiple deliveries and maybe our house isnt the first house to get delivered to but it should not take more than an hour to get here the pizza is already going to be cold by the time they get here i called the store to check the status of the order and the manager ana kept making up excuses as to why the delivery is late oh sorry were a bit understaffed today two drivers called off i understand stuff like this happens but when i asked why the status online says it was already out the door she said we were really busy and just had to push out all these orders but the driver left  minutes ago huh that doesnt make sense so they just update the status without it being true i would have rather them leaving the order as is knowing that my order wasnt made yet versus them lying saying it left the store and me wondering why is it taking forever all in all take your money elsewhere the delivery service sucks making you pay a delivery fee when theyre not even on time not going to order from dominoes ever again update as i was writing this review the delivery guy finally came as expected the food was already cold i lost my appetite the driver didnt even apologize for taking a long time  minutes to get here like i said just take your money elsewhere just went to this location to pick up an order  walked inside and there were two employees at the counter one on the phone i wasnt greeted by either of them after about  seconds i say i have a pick up  with my name  the guy starts to scramble around looking for my order  asking what it was  after the guy who i assume is the manager gets off the phone an older asian gentleman he hangs up and starts yelling shit  lady is laughing at me you can eat and order or not  i dont give a shit and walks away as his other employees laugh still scrambling to find my order  i work in customer service and if i were to talk like that in front of customers  id definitely be fired they continued to laugh as the guy placed my salad in a bag and dropped it on the counter and walked away  i wasnt told thank you by any three employees  completely unprofessional location  will not be going back here and i live  minute down the street  would rather spend my time driving to round table  they dont ever pick up the phone i been ordering from this store for a while and the pizza is been quite alright and i always tip good the costumer service sucks big time when it comes to calling i ordered a pepperoni pizza with jalapeños and when i open my pizza obviously starving i only see jalapeños that of course really upset me since i was hungry so i called the store and let me tell you they took forever to answer the call once they did this guy didnt understand me at all that my pizza didnt have pepperoni so i talked to someone else and i told him i have a pizza in front of me just with jalapeños and no pepperoni so he said ahhhhh ok so what do you want me to do and i said well send me the pizza that i ordered he pretty much was lagging and telling me that it was pm which they close at midnight that
