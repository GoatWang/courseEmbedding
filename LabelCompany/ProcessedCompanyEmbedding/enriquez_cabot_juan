rectificó la decisión de no publicar el artículo de su colaborador el pasado  de julio lo cual provocó una reacción en redes sociales y lo incluye este miércoles en su sección de opinión fotoel colombiano de medellín redacción an julio  0 00 am este es el texto de juan enríquez cabot editorialista de reforma que no fue publicado el lunes “respeto…” por juan enríquez cabot reforma jueves  de julio 0 difícil encontrar en el periodismo tres gentes con métodos usos y costumbres mas opuestas a isabel arvide julio scherer y ramón alberto garza el cómo se conducen que hacen con quienes conviven que encuentran aceptable o no… probablemente los horrorice verse nombrados en la misma columna y quizás en este periódico por lo cual les pido de antemano disculpas a los tres no estoy de acuerdo con todo lo que han hecho escrito o a veces sus métodos pero es extraordinaria su valentía durante décadas enfrentando y balconeando algunos de los asuntos más duros que ha vivido y vive el país por eso respeto a los tres aun conociendo su profunda como diría un cura “humanidad” tenemos un mejor país porque por algún milagro los tres siguen vivos hay muchos que escriben opinan embrujan con palabras fugas de información o acceso al poder hay por fortuna cada vez más que denuncian balconean se burlan exhiben las fallas y peripecias del poder pero son o bien pocos los que tocan año tras año los cuatro temas más peligrosos que puede tocar la tinta el alto mando militar la policía federal procuraduría el narco y la vida personal y familiar del presidente en funciones a su manera a su estilo con su propio punto de vista aliados fuentes perspectiva arvide scherer y garza se han jugado una y otra vez la vida exponiendo exhibiendo explicando denunciando hasta el filito mismo de donde se sufre un accidente una desaparición un asesinato porque lo que tocan es lo más delicado de lo que no se discute en méxico nombran dan hechos citas y documentos se meten a las cárceles y entrevistan denuncian cuando se tiene poder siguen investigando y denunciando después no quitan el dedo hay pocas gentes con los pantalones y astucia para enfrentar tocar osar publicar lo que han hecho estos tres no es que estén de acuerdo que sean amigos que escriban lo mismo al contrario muchas veces lee uno lo escrito por uno y contradice absolutamente lo escrito por otro pero al entrevistar a los narcos en sus casas al acostarse o emborrachase con varios generales al denunciar de frente a los más poderosos meterse en los barrios más oscuros recibir infinidad de pitazos y denuncias cada uno a su manera con propio estilo lentes y prejuicios van dejando testigo y huella de la historia más compleja de méxico hemos de agradecerles lo que hacen porque es cada vez más peligroso escribir denunciar iluminar no muchos publicarían un libro como mis generales que detalla las intimidades recovecos honores cuestionamientos usos y costumbres del poder militar poder que se esparce cada vez más y que es cada vez más importante entender antes de este libro no había en un lugar tanta anécdota transparencia intimidad sobre lo bueno valiente trágico y corrupto de los individuos que mas mando tienen en el país antes de que scherer se metiera en los setentas y ochentas no había muchos que de manera sistémica y constante denunciaran exploraran explicaran las redes de los narcos más poderosos del país o las peripecias de el señor presidente… ramón alberto nacido por fortuna en época anterior a las medicinas contra el síndrome de déficit de atención usa su peripatética energía co pariendo  reforma reporte índigo y ahora un periódico a diario se pelea a muerte con amigos enemigos poderosos y peligrosos explicando en detalle quien usa poder para que fin cada uno de los tres deja pedacitos migajas pistas realidades y verdades que seguirán entreteniendo a historiadores durante décadas porque no hay mucho lugar donde encontrar gran y constante historial de denuncias contra los más altos niveles en torno a lo más peligroso que se puede tocar en el país cuando algún estudiante de doctorado quiera entender lo que paso en cuartel militar comandancia de policía agencia de seguridad y justicia entre los criminales más peligrosos con y sin charola con y sin fuero con y sin grandes títulos puestos y apellidos tendrán que leer comparar contrastar triangular y criticar lo escrito por estos tres y unos cuantos más arvide prista a muerte da cuenta de las reglas usos y costumbres desde muy muy adentro del aparato scherer antipriista desnuda desde afuera ramón alberto maneja la tecnología bases de datos y triangulaciones de innumerables telefonazos estableciendo nuevos métodos y estilos de comunicación seguramente hay múltiples equivocaciones alianzas y denuncias erróneas pero lo que no van a encontrar críticos son muchas fuentes adicionales que denunciaron durante décadas porque hay temas que son mortales… y es precisamente por eso entendiendo que son más que humanos con lo bello y lo trágico metido bajo la piel que estas tres figuras tan distintas merecen respeto y admiración los seguiré leyendo con atención cierto temor por sus vidas y espero suficiente escepticismo paro poder
