happy to report that our second fiscal quarter  that in our second fiscal quarter we were profitable on net income basis both gaap and nongaap we reported nongaap earnings per share of  and adjusted ebitda of just under  million which represents close to a  million yearoveryear improvement we also increased our cash by over  million sequentially the strategy we implemented to improve our business has proven to be effective and we are increasingly confident that we can sustain profitability moving forward our focus on process improvements and driving efficiencies in our business will continue and we are now in a position to increase our actions towards profitable topline growth overall im very proud of our accomplishments as a company and as a team although there is more to do i want to thank all of our employees for seeing our turnaround through and enabling us to achieve these much improved results now lets talk about the quarter we reported revenue of  million which was  million or  higher than the prior quarter and came within  on a yearoveryear basis while our book to bill was under  it was within our expected range and as i mentioned on our last investor call bookings will vary from quarter to quarter this quarter we reported nongaap gross margins of  an improvement of  basis points sequentially when comparing to last year’s second quarter gross margins increased by approximately  basis points higher volumes in north america led to a favorable mix and positively impacted margins stronger operational execution in our supply chain and services areas also contributed to better performance and we believe these improvements are sustainable moving forward looking ahead we expect  as the new norm for gross margins so quarters may fluctuate based on mix by approximately  basis points on either side nongaap operating expenses this quarter came in at  million an improvement of  million over q and  million over last years quarter  last year’s second quarter of note our opex for the quarter included a bad debt recovery of approximately  which impacted expenses favorably in q there were also other timing related benefits of approximately  notwithstanding these factors our opex was still substantially better sequentially and year over year our current quarterly run rate excluding onetime events or any upticks in spending to support growth is approximately  to  million in terms of profitability our goal for q was to achieve positive adjusted ebitda which we did comfortably at  million we generated nongaap net income of  million which is aviat’s single best quarter since the second quarter of fiscal year  four years prior on a gaap basis we reported net income of  million our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our working capital metrics are the best weve seen in years our cash position of  million grew just over  million compared to the fiscal  first quarter dsos were down and inventory turns were up our team has done a remarkable job and were positioned to generate cash in the second half of the fiscal year moving on to our business and outlook looking first at north america we had a strong quarter in north america the sector represented  of our total mix in q compared to  in the same quarter a year ago the result of our consistent success in winning new business especially in private networks in north america revenue was up approximately  million sequentially we had seven customers from a variety of utility state and local government projects that represented more than  million each in q revenue as well also since we last reported we announced two new awards with us federal government agencies and a new agreement with naspo valuepoint the nationwide purchasing arm of naspo which provides us with greater reach into us state and local government agencies while accelerating the sales process q revenue from our north american service provider customers remain steady and we expect volume in the near term to remain in the same zone our strategy has not changed we will continue to explore opportunities to participate with other operators that we currently do not do business with while also investing to support our installed base and ensuring we are well positioned longer term as plans for g deployments evolve moving on to the international arena international revenue for the first half of the fiscal year was down approximately  million compared to the same period last year i would say however that the overall market appears to be stabilizing that is it hasnt gotten any worse than we expected and there are pockets where we are seeing increased activity and new opportunities relative to q we saw sequential revenue gains in africa and latin america which offset some of the lower volumes throughout europe and asia business with mtn has picked up and during the second quarter they remained a  plus customer for us we also announced new business with airtel nigeria becoming their countrywide managed service provider for enterprise access in a challenging environment we focused on providing outstanding support to our existing customers and as a result we are maintaining our position we are investing in our technology portfolio to strengthen our competitive position we will soon unveil some exciting new products that will serve as a catalyst for addressing new customers and markets and support our future growth ambitions a few comments on our balance sheet our q cash and cash equivalents balance of  million was up indiscernible and since fiscal  year end weve increased our next cash position by  million our cash flow from operations was  million in the second quarter and yeartodate was  million dsos continued to improve dsos during q were  days compared to  days in q and  days in q of fiscal  dsos were positively impacted by our higher concentration of north america business along with improved collections internationally our inventory position of  million is down from  million reported in q and down  million compared to our fiscal  year end we continue to focus on process enhancements related to inventory management and our turns of  times is a significant improvement over prior quarters were very pleased with the progress we are making in working capital management with the improvement in receivables and inventories our cash conversion cycle has substantially fallen over the past six months let me now shift to our outlook in the second half of the fiscal year were expecting revenues to be approximately  million to  million with q in the range of the low to mids and q higher most likely in excess of  million relative to last year’s second half our estimate will yield between  and  revenue growth we expect to report positive nongaap operating income for the second half of the fiscal year with q coming in near breakeven we also expect to report positive adjusted eps in both the fiscal  third and fourth quarters lastly we anticipate a slight cash usage in q due to new programs kicking off internationally but our cash position is expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year in closing the strategy we put in place was intended to drive us to profitability this fiscal year this was achieved in the fiscal second quarter and we believe were positioned for growth in the second half of the year while sustaining profitability weve exceeded our nearterm gross margin target and improved our processes and cost structure significantly we now have a stronger foundation in place with a clear line of sight to drive performance with profitability achieved and continued balance sheet improvements we are now shifting towards a growth mindset we will continue to pursue all strategic avenues that will enhance our offering market position and valuation that has not changed lastly i want to sincerely thank our shareholders achieving profitability in a macro challenged environment has been a difficult task but we have emerged a stronger company many of our shareholders have been very supportive throughout this turnaround process were excited with our prospects and looking forward to building on this momentum thank you for your continued support this concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of orin hirschman from aigh investment partners orin hirschman hi congratulations on the terrific results i know its been long in coming and youre working very hard and thank god its nice its very gratifying to see a quick question just on the actual numbers themselves the nongaap eps number that included the  i want to make sure i know the exact number  that included roughly  benefit plus another minor benefit kevin holwell thats correct yes orin hirschman okay do you happen to have the adjusted eps number without those onetime benefits kevin holwell i think it’s about  per share impact roughly orin hirschman okay so it would have been  kevin holwell that’s correct yeah orin hirschman okay in terms of  you know carriers are steady any reason to believe that theres any big change in the spending or thats really going to depend on a year or two from now g and were just going to  more of a steadystate mode and its nice to win the nigerian in  but is that actually for the carrier or is that for their trying to get corporate customers for private networks i wasnt clear on that michael pangia yeah it’s more  so the enterprise play in nigeria is more associated with working with the operator to drive business with corporate business utilizing our solutions as far as the mobile operator front i mean we feel very confident that we actually have an opportunity to enter some other operators that we’re currently not doing business with having said that the business will continue to be steady and i wouldnt rule out opportunities for growth within some existing accounts again based on probably more in the position of taking some share from others that are with those customers not expecting any major uptick in capex in the near term but we definitely anticipate that to be the case in the medium to longer term orin hirschman okay in terms of the market it’s really been working so well for you which is north america private corporate networks obviously thats really been great and it gets you in where you do a  million or a  million fourth quarter what gets you to the  million to  million mark assuming that the carrier world kind of just stays in the doldrums but steady like you outlined whats needed to get you even further on the private network side or its just a matter of time michael pangia well so first i can say that i have a very very strong funnel of opportunities which puts us into a i guess more an optimistic position on our ability to generate growth moving forward so it first starts with the line of sight the opportunities that i see that would represent further growth within the private networks vertical i do want to again go back to what i said earlier whether its private networks or mobile and when i talk about mobile theres different tiers to mobile everything from the top tier all the way down to lower tier regional providers we have a lot of opportunity to actually start addressing customers that we havent really focused on that much in the past that are in some of these two tiers and in some geographies that we havent really focused on even within private networks and we see a lot of opportunity as i said earlier to actually position ourselves and take share from others to drive growth if the overall market picks up to me that would even provide further fuel for us to drive growth even further than we anticipate orin hirschman is there anything critical on the new product side michael pangia so our current portfolio that we have is very strong we have a number of dimensions to our offerings that differentiate us from others so when you look at total cost of ownership and include the services layer we feel very good about our position we will be introducing some new products in the coming weeks stay tuned for that and we believe that that will be a further catalyst to position us even more favorably and open up additional opportunities on some of the new customers that i highlighted earlier operator operator instructions and there are no further questions michael pangia thank you operator operator thank you this does

on the phone as well as on the webcast weve experienced good progress since our last earnings call in late january in february we announced key contract wins in africa in march we premiered what we believe to be the worlds most powerful microwave radio for missioncritical networks and throughout the quarter our ctr product experienced a significant ramp in bookings and shipments and today im pleased to announce that a large north america mobile operator has selected aviat to modernize its network it was our technology offering combined with our strong services and network management capabilities that were instrumental in helping us secure this new customer win ill now provide an overview of our financial results followed by this quarters customer and product activity mike shahbazian will give a more indepth review of our financial results and will provide our guidance for the upcoming quarter ill then close the call by discussing the actions we are taking to further optimize and improve our business model our fiscal third quarter financial results were largely as expected and we made progress with bookings and our expense reduction initiatives fiscal third quarter revenue was  million we estimate that our revenue was reduced by approximately  million due to the strengthening of the us dollar against many of our international currencies q bookings improved significantly on a sequential basis and we have returned to reporting a book to bill above  we are seeing momentum in bookings across nearly every geographic segment largely fuelled by our ctr product line nongaap gross margin was  and was impacted by a couple of onetime events that mike will describe in greater detail in his comments demonstrating the progress weve already made with our expense reduction actions third quarter nongaap operating expenses were down approximately  million or  yearoveryear and nearly  million or  sequentially to  million we expect to exit fiscal  with a nongaap opex run rate of approximately  million with further improvements expected by midyear fiscal  adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was a loss of  million versus a loss of  million in the year earlier period for the first nine months of fiscal  adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million versus a loss of  million for the first nine months of fiscal  our nongaap loss per share for the third quarter was  an improvement over the  loss per share reported in the year ago quarter now for an update on customer and productivity in our major geographic areas starting with north america our mobile and nonmobile business continues on course on the mobile side during the quarter we secured a  million contract with a leading north america regional operator and began shipping the allindoor iru  for the carriers western region backhaul network the contract includes a strong services component in which we will provide turnkey integration and deployment support and as i mentioned earlier we recently secured first time business with a large north america mobile operator our technology offering and the strong services offering were key differentiators which allowed aviat to win this new customer in q we experienced a steady flow of business from our nonmobile operations and we expect to see more opportunities in public safety and private low latency networks in q and beyond that said its important to remember that due to the longer bookings to revenue conversion cycle and binary nature of this business the specific timing of the revenue from our nonmobile business is difficult to predict revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal  illustrates the inconsistent timing and lumpiness of our nonmobile revenue while fiscal third quarter revenue for north america was down yearoveryear and sequentially our north america revenue for the first nine months of fiscal  was up  yearoveryear to  million driven by the strength in our private networks business maintaining our leadership as a provider for missioncritical networks we recently premiered the iru  ehp two to three times more powerful than the typical radio in the market today we believe the iru  is the most powerful commercial microwave radio ever produced for use with the  gigahertz and  gigahertz bands the product is designed to support missioncritical applications of all types moving to an update on our operations in africa across the continent major players are making investments in enhancing their networks and offering services for businesses and enterprises our ctr product with its dual microwave networking and routing capabilities is designed specifically to capitalize on this trend we are increasingly confident in our position as an important supplier in the region and in q we secured multiple new contracts in africa recently we began to deliver equipment and perform services under a new threeyear turnkey agreement with mtn south africa we’ll be working with this tier  mobile operator to modernize its mobile backhaul network and expand its network services as another example this quarter we announced several deals with another major african mobile operator in which aviat is supplying the ctr eclipse and str microwave radios to complete the operator’s transition to full ip as part of these projects our work will extend through gabon nigeria and tanzania we are encouraged by our progress in diversifying our business in africa and believe that our specialized services capabilities will continue to differentiate us from our competition in summary our progress in the quarter is a great illustration of the success we’ve had of reducing our cost structure and realigning our product and services offerings to meet the needs of existing and new customers we signed new contracts and added new customers the ctr platform is clearly helping us win new business and retain our position with key customers and we expect this trend to continue q orders for ctr doubled from the prior quarter and through the first five weeks of this quarter we have already matched the orders total from q over the next several quarters we remain focused on expanding share with our key customers attracting targeted new customers leveraging our new product ramp improving operational efficiencies and generating cash we are seeing improvement in our operations and we are pleased overall with the progress we’ve made this quarter now i’ll turn the call over to mike shahbazian to discuss our financial results in more detail mike michael shahbazian thank you mike and thanks to all of you for joining us if youve not already done so i’d encourage you to download the financial press release from the investors section of our website that we posted earlier today the release contains aviats unaudited gaap financial statements along with a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures my prepared remarks will be focused on the nongaap financial overview of our fiscal third quarter and the related business trends unless otherwise stated and other than revenue all dollar figures i provide will be on a nongaap basis i’ll then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter revenue for the third quarter came in at  million compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and to  million in the third quarter of fiscal  product revenue was  of sales and services were  of sales the same ratios as in the second quarter gross margin for the third quarter was  of sales down from  of sales of our fiscal second quarter the third quarter gross margin was impacted by less favourable absorption of fixed costs due to lower volumes and changes in currency that occurred in the quarter as many other usbased companies have reported we’re affected by the continuing strengthening of the dollar margin was reduced by currency impact and additional realized foreign currencies losses which added  million to our cost of sales resulting in  basis point drop in our gross margin for the fiscal third quarter our operating expenses totaled  million down from  million in the fiscal second quarter this sequential decline was driven by a benefit from the change in currency rates and implementation of our expense reduction measures third quarter operating expenses were down approximately  million or  yearoveryear our loss from continuing operations for the fiscal third quarter was  million or a loss of  per share compared to a loss from continuing operations of  million or a loss of  per share in the year ago quarter fiscal third quarter adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million compared to a loss of  million in the year ago quarter the company ended the fiscal third quarter with a cash balance of  million down from  million at the close of the fiscal second quarter our cash balance was affected by movement in exchange rates relative to the dollar in the quarter particularly in countries where we are unable to hedge our balance sheet reducing our us dollar reported cash by  million in addition as a result of repatriating cash in the quarter we incurred expenses of approximately  million cash used by operating activities was  in the fiscal third quarter capex in the quarter amounted to  free cash flow which includes the cash used in operating activities plus capex was a use of  million for the quarter now moving to working capital dsos were  days up from  days last fiscal quarter dsos declined due to decreased revenue in the quarter our actual receivables and payables balances declined substantially reflecting the volume of business in the quarter days payables outstanding were  days compared to  last quarter and terms decreased to  from  inventories increased due to startup activities related to the network build out in south africa i’d now like to turn your attention to guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of  we expect revenue for our fourth quarter in the range of  million to  million we estimate that our adjusted ebitda will be approximately breakeven we consider adjusted ebitda to be a good proxy for company cash flows over a normalized period we expect breakeven to a slight use of cash for the quarter regarding liquidity we believe our existing cash balance line of credit and expected future cash collections will provide us with adequate liquidity i would now like to turn the call over to mike for some additional remarks before we turn the call over to the operator for questions mike pangia thanks mike we see momentum from our bookings this quarter carrying over to higher revenue performance in q and we will make further strides with our business model in other areas the introduction of our new products particularly the ctr platform is proving to be instrumental requiring new customers as well as increasing our footprint with existing customers our focus on simplifying the business has resulted in a significant reduction in our expenses which puts us on a clear path to cash generation as i look forward to fiscal year  im increasingly confident that the actions we have taken are starting to pay off i would like to thank all of aviat’s employees for their hard work and efforts now back to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we will go first to evan dede with hc wainwright kevin dede good afternoon gentlemen it’s kevin dede a bunch of things for you mike and no offence mr shahbazian but i guess i was kind of wondering how you felt about life at aviat and what your plans were michael shahbazian my plans well ive been a cfo this is my ninth company and i started doing interim roles after about  years so i enjoy doing this but i immensely enjoyed my time period with aviat its a very interesting organization with a very interesting executive and management team and i would say that its an experience i’ll treasure going forward so all of these have been experiences and this one is very unique along those lines kevin dede so how would you say the search for a permanent cfo is going mike pangia is that question to mr shahbazian or michael shahbazian it should be to mike pangia kevin dede yeah that’s sort of an open one mike pangia yeah its going very very well and we are getting very close so notwithstanding that again i appreciate mike being on board kevin dede great okay so mr pangia how would you characterize the integration of ctr and mtn and how are the network engineers there thinking about the evolution of their network going forward and do you see it sort of i guess their engineers are leveraging your platform to incorporate smallcell if necessary in densely populated areas just give me some sort of  foot perspective on how you’re viewing the integration process mike pangia well first off we feel very good about our position with mtn we continue to be very focused on delivering value to them as expressed in the recent press release i think winning new business with them is an indication that we are continuing to deliver value ctr is instrumental in that value proposition both in terms of its capabilities from a layer  perspective as well as its networking capabilities and we actually appreciate the business with mtn and we strive to exceed their expectations on a daily basis and we will continue focusing on delivering them value notwithstanding that we also feel very good about the progress weve made with other customers in africa which also see value in what we’re providing not only with respect to ctr but also our strong services and support capabilities in the region also are critical to delivering tco or at least the best tco relative to other providers and we will continue to strive for that kevin dede okay i guess sort of as a recall to layer  could you sort of take it up into another level of detail what are they experiencing that you might be able to put the decision as a selling point for other operators mike pangia yes so we have a number of elements in the value proposition in terms of the products capabilities from a layer  transmission perspective its ability to do routing and other layer  capabilities which also helps as we look at the enterprise space and then on top of that we have a very strong service capability and support capability which in the broader scheme of things isn’t just about the pulling equipment and supporting it but it’s also regarding the logistical elements of working in a region like africa kevin dede so i guess mike what i was hoping you might be able to help me clarify is just through the evolution of mobile networks in general i guess im kind of wondering i mean there has been obviously there is a lot of talk about software defined network and it just seems to me that the ctr fits into that type of evolutionary thinking im just kind of wondering how the engineers at mtn view that and how they see the ctr as an integral product in that evolutionary group mike pangia first off im looking at the product’s capabilities and the other attributes that we provide beyond just mtn so kevin dede no i understand but i mean just wanted to see if the standout is sort of the leading customer on the curve of adoption mike pangia no weve had must multiple customers adopting the product now as i referred to earlier we’ve seen a doubling of orders from the second quarter and the third and through the first five week it’s already equalled the whole last quarter this is much more than just mtn so as we talk about the broad range of customers are looking at this product and as it relates to your comments earlier about sdn or software defined networks this is a step in that direction from the standpoint that it does take products that are multiple products and it integrates that functionality into a product it does provide more software in terms of the value and also another important element as we’re moving it into the software defined networking world is service capabilities have to be strong because the opex part of the equation is also becoming even more critical to a customer and we are also addressing that with our service capabilities network management tools and support kevin dede okay your new north american customer the one that you announced here this evening is it fair to say that that customer is a tier  mike pangia its a large north american mobile operator kevin dede okay the expense run rate you characterized and it’s at the  million range for the next quarter but in your restructuring release what was it maybe a month or two ago you commented that you hope to extract another  million to  million out of operating expenses and this evening you seem to reiterate that and seeing expenses reduce further for the first half of the next fiscal year im just wondering how you might rather characterize that expense reduction and how we might see it in the pl michael shahbazian okay so first off when i talked about a  million exit rate to some extent you cant look an individual quarter especially our fourth quarter in anticipation of strong bookings which we expect to continue there is a variable element on our sales expense that usually increases in the fourth quarter related to it’s one of the stronger quarters we normally have with respect to our bookings and then notwithstanding that we expect to see further improvements in that opex moving into fiscal year  and thats when you will see further improvements all other things being equal kevin dede okay but at this point you are not comfortable sort of giving us a ballpark on where you expect to see that michael shahbazian we expect it to be improved it will be improved versus the  million again all things being equal there is obviously variable expenses associated with our business as well and to the extent that our business is better than what one would expect from a run rate perspective that number could be higher but we’re very focused actually on reducing the fixed cost element of that even further than where we are at right now kevin dede right so on that fixed cost discussion is there any of that that you think relates to cost of goods michael shahbazian well our reductions ive only referred to the element associated with the opex side but not referencing first of all i’m not referencing cost of goods here i’m referencing the spending associated with delivering and supporting products and above and beyond the opex reductions we’re also having reductions in terms of the overhead part of our business with respect to our supply chain further signifying that that benefit which show up as an improvement in our margins kevin dede right okay can you shed any light on where you might expect gross margin to fall out in the june quarter michael shahbazian all i can say is that we’re very focused on improvements across the whole pl our focus is on generating positive ebitda and gross margins is one lever as part of that value proposition so i would see  i am expecting an improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter but im also expecting improvements in other areas and our focus going forward is ph on generating positive ebitda on a consistent quarterly basis kevin dede okay could you talk to sort of the overall pricing environment in north america africa and then i suppose i guess asia and europe as much as you can see michael shahbazian its always difficult to provide pricing elements without  again without reconciling it to total cost of ownership because there is elements when we talk when we think about pricing we’re usually thinking just about the capex part of the equation and thats different than providing value so what i’m seeing in the industry is that there is obviously continued compression from a hardware perspective its more intensive in the international arena than it is in north america but the perspective there is that’s continuing to be pressured and again thats why software defined network is an important element but the other values we’re providing in terms of software capability ability to improve the support the service side those are all attributes that lead to improving value to the customer which ends up generating a benefit on our end in terms of margin and other elements kevin dede can you talk a little bit about that pricing equation visavis ctr and the competitive offering that you see from independence michael shahbazian so the other element of pricing is there are certain markets where there is a focus primarily on just the capex side of the equation that are extremely price sensitive and its very difficult to drive value in those markets that are only looking at one element of the equation part of our restructuring efforts have been to focus our activities and where we see the opportunity for that value creation to be there and thats where ctr fits in as well as all the other elements i discussed earlier with regards to our service and support capabilities and that’s where our focus is in those markets with those customers and its not just about the mobile operator side as well we have a significant amount of business in the public safety private networks domain in some cases the sensitivity on price is not as high its about delivering value the missioncritical capabilities of the product are important so thats what i mean the pricing equation is difficult to answer without getting reference to markets and verticals and where we are focused and where we are not focused kevin dede okay fair enough could you give us the breakdown between product and service revenues for march versus december mike pangia sure mike michael shahbazian march versus december mike pangia the last i guess q kevin dede sequentially yeah michael shahbazian okay im sorry so you wanted the kevin dede yeah mike i was just looking for product and service reps percent ph of sales for december and march michael shahbazian yeah so as a breakout between services and product revenues for the quarter as a percentage of revenues right is that what you’re looking for kevin dede yeah right it doesnt have to be percent i mean if you have the real dollars whatever you want to offer michael shahbazian right kevin i think that was covered in the script and it was  for services revenue  product revenue and  for services revenue mike pangia we said it was pretty much even michael shahbazian pretty much even with the same numbers we had for the second quarter kevin dede okay fair enough thank you one last question for me mike there is a lot of chatter about nokia and alcatel and i guess there are people on both sides of it right whether or not the french government will go for it im wondering what sort of disruption you think it may be causing now and how it might change the competitive landscape for you particularly going forward mike pangia yes so our focuses are on things that we can control and clearly any time there is something like that that takes place it could provide an opportunity based on the fact that there will be integration and there is probably lots of unknown factors so we’ll look at that as an opportunity at least in the near term and we’ll continue to focus in on building our business moving forward kevin dede the win with the new north american carrier who do you think you displaced there and why mike pangia im not going to answer that question no comments on that question kevin dede okay alright well i’ll turn it over thank you for working with me mike i appreciate it mike pangia indiscernible so i cant comment on who was displaced but again i will reinforce that our winning there was a combination of our strong product offering and our service capabilities including elements like network management those were the differentiators kevin dede network management okay but not from say youre not just helping them manage their own mike pangia network management platform in combination with the products kevin dede right okay thank you mike pangia you’re welcome operator we’ll move next to aaron yu with singular research aaron yu hey good afternoon guys mike pangia good afternoon aaron yu so it sounds like the momentum acceleration in the bookings was pretty broadbased across a lot of geographies wanted to see if you guys can give a little bit more color to whether there is some pentup demand thats coming back in the market or was it more a function of adoption of ctr and product specific initiatives mike pangia yeah so im very pleased with the actions that weve taken with respect to what we are focusing the ramp of our new products continue to leverage our service capabilities and a combination of all those actions is starting to bear fruit with respect to new customer wins which is showing up in terms of improvement in bookings and im feeling increasingly more confident that we continue to see some great momentum again largely fuelled by ctr which i did indicate already this quarter in the first five weeks in terms of the ramp there so we’re feeling very good about the actions weve taken and the direction we are heading aaron yu and the repatriation of cash was that just increase for your exposure to fx in any geographies for you guys and hedge or are there sort of other drivers in rationale behind that michael shahbazian right so we had built up  this is mike we had built up some excess cash in a couple of our international units where it is very difficult to do currency transactions so we made a decision to accelerate payments and enter in to a couple of swap transactions that allowed us to bring cash back to the us that certainly helped us from a liquidity standpoint in the us so that was essential for doing that but because the markets aren’t particularly welldeveloped there is just no active foreign exchange market you we have to do a swap with using bankers and intermediary and there was a cost of doing that and that was the impact that we had to deal with at the same time it did allow us to repatriate a significant amount of cash that we can use in the us aaron yu so that cost was that the million dollars you mentioned michael shahbazian that was a million dollars between foreign exchange and also withholding costs so the foreign exchange was swap cost and we had some withholding taxes because of the country’s tax regulations aaron yu okay thank you guys mike pangia thank you operator and with that there are no further questions in todays conference we do thank you all for your
