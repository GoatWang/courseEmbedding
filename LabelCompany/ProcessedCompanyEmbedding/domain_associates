specifically in abstract algebra an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility in an integral domain every nonzero element a has the cancellation property that is if a ≠  an equality ab  ac implies b  c integral domain is defined almost universally as above but there is some variation this article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity generally denoted  but some authors do not follow this by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity noncommutative integral domains are sometimes admitted this article however follows the much more usual convention of reserving the term integral domain for the commutative case and using domain for the general case including noncommutative rings some sources notably lang use the term entire ring for integral domain some specific kinds of integral domains are given with the following chain of class inclusions commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ gcd domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields algebraic structures grouplike semigroup  monoid racks and quandles quasigroup and loop abelian group magma lie group

number of equivalent definitions of integral domain an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring with no nonzero zero divisors an integral domain is a commutative ring in which the zero ideal  is graded then the associated projective scheme is also reduced and irreducible if r is a commutative ring and p is an ideal in r then the quotient ring rp is an integral domain if and only if p is a prime ideal let r be an integral domain then there is an integral domain s such that r ⊂ s and s has an element which is transcendental over r the cancellation property holds in any integral domain for any a b and c in an integral domain if a ≠  and ab  ac then b  c another way to state this is that the function x ↦ ax is injective for any nonzero a in the domain the cancellation property holds for ideals in any integral domain if xi  xj then either x is zero or i  j an integral domain is equal to the intersection of its localizations at maximal ideals an inductive limit of integral domains is an integral domain field of fractionsedit main article field of fractions the field of fractions k of an integral domain r is the set of fractions ab with a and b in r and b ≠  modulo an appropriate equivalence relation equipped with the usual addition and multiplication operations it is the smallest field containing r in the sense that there is an injective ring homomorphism r → k such that any injective ring homomorphism from r to a field factors through k the field of fractions of the ring of integers z is the field of rational numbers q the field of fractions of a field is isomorphic to the field itself algebraic geometryedit integral domains are characterized by the condition that they are reduced that is x   implies x   and irreducible that is there is only one minimal prime ideal the former condition ensures that the nilradical of the ring is zero so that the intersection of all the rings minimal primes is zero the latter condition is that the ring have only one minimal prime it follows that the unique minimal prime ideal of a reduced and irreducible ring is the zero ideal so such rings are integral domains the converse is clear an integral domain has no nonzero nilpotent elements and the zero ideal is the unique minimal prime ideal this translates in algebraic geometry into the fact that the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is an integral domain if and only if the algebraic set is an algebraic variety more generally a commutative ring is an integral domain if and only if its spectrum is an integral affine scheme characteristic and homomorphismsedit the characteristic of an integral domain is either  or a prime number if r is an integral domain of prime characteristic p then the frobenius endomorphism fx  x p is injective see alsoedit the wikibook abstract algebra has a page on the topic of integral domains
