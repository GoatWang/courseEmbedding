bruce mcclelland bruce bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc great thanks bob and good evening everyone and thank you for joining us so why dont we go ahead and get started and please turn to slide  so im pleased to report that our first quarter finished a little stronger than i indicated a few weeks ago at our investor conference sales in the quarter were at the top end of guidance with nongaap revenue of  billion and nongaap eps result were  per share similarly at the very high end of guidance as the quarter closed out we had several deals come together with customers needing rapid delivery while q was certainly a slower start to the year as we discussed at the investor conference we continue to see momentum increasing as the year progresses cash flow in the quarter was excellent with strong collections from shipments late in the fourth quarter  backlog and booktobill were seasonably strong and dsos improved from the fourth quarter we used a portion of this strong free cash flow to repurchase shares in the first quarter as well as in april dave will share more details on that in a minute in particular our international business was very strong up  yearoveryear and increasing to  of our overall business in the quarter the teams just done a great job executing on new project wins from earlier last year and translating that into meaningful growth in  we expect this trend to continue as the year progresses including projects at liberty global telefónica jcom in japan and nbn in australia as expected our network and cloud segment was down this quarter with lower cmts sales during the transition period to our gen  technology and our professional services business was lower due to typical seasonality in that business this was offset by continued strength in our fiber optics which is the access technologies business also as expected our cpe business was down this quarter after a very strong fourth quarter but broadband sales were up on good demand for advanced gateways and enhanced home networking this correlates very well with the success our customers are having in the market growing their broadband subscriber base and we expect the video cpe business to snap back starting in the second quarter please turn to slide  as we discussed in detail at the investor conference we expect continued improvement as the year progresses and i believe we are well on track to achieve the full year financial targets we have provided while the pressure on margin will continue due to higher memory costs we have much better visibility into demand and see a very solid funnel the key technology trends that underpin our business fiber deep programs docsis  upgrades advanced wireless home networking and k video are definitely playing out and the gen upgrade cycle on our e ccap platform will begin in next quarter our customers plan to leverage this platform to provide a variety of distributed access architectures and we expect to be in commercial deployment of this new network design by the end of the year regarding our upcoming acquisition of the ruckus wireless and icx switching business from broadcom and brocade weve been making very good progress with behindthescenes integration planning we have already received the necessary antitrust approvals and now expect the deal to close in the august timeframe after broadcom closes their deal response from customers and channel partners has been very positive and were anxious to close the transaction and get on with the next phase of the companys growth plan dave why dont you go through the financials in a little more detail and then larry and dan will comment on their businesses david b potts  arris international plc sounds great well thanks bruce and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon and im very pleased to report on a good quarter so lets go to the financial highlights on chart  please so sales in the first quarter  billion and were at the upper end of our guidance this compares to  billion in the fourth quarter of  and  billion in the first quarter of last years sales in q were reduced by about  million as a result of recording a noncash fair value adjustment related to our warrant program so excluding this impact our nongaap sales were  billion gaap gross margin was approximately  in the first quarter down from  in the fourth quarter of last year and  in the first quarter of last year nongaap gross margin was  in the first quarter and again down from both the fourth and the first quarter of last year in memory pricing product and customer mix and new product introductions impacted the trends operating expenses were  million in the first quarter weve spent considerable energy on our cost structure post the pace acquisition and im very pleased with our results our opex run rate is improved by  million from the first quarter of  the first quarter in which we owned pace and  million from the fourth quarter of last year our first quarter  gaap eps was a loss of  which compares to  profit in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of  in the first quarter of  nongaap eps was at the high end of our guidance at  in the quarter which compares to  in the fourth quarter of  and  in the first quarter of  and as always a reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap results is attached to the press release and you can also find it on our website we ended q with  billion of cash resources and of course well be using a portion of our cash to fund the ruckus acquisition later this year our bank debt ended q just under  billion and as im sure youve read we completed an amendandextend of our term loan b debt in april with very favorable terms the new maturity is now  im very pleased with the outcome and thank our bank group for their continued support cash from operating activities was approximately  million in q and this is up significantly from  million in the fourth quarter the increase was driven by the expected decrease in accounts receivable and i will remind you that in the first quarter of  we used  million of cash from operating activities which was significantly impacted by the pace acquisition and in the first quarter we repurchased  million shares worth – for a total of  million and since quarter end weve repurchased an additional  million shares for approximately  million so that has exhausted our prior authorization and leaves  million available under the new authorization we announced at our investor day in march and attached to the presentation is more detail related to our results and we of course are happy to answer any questions you may have lets go to slide  please so guidance as bruce mentioned earlier were incrementally positive about our fullyear guidance at this point we estimate that well have gaap sales of  billion to  billion and nongaap sales of  billion to  billion in the second quarter we anticipate well have gaap earnings of  to  and nongaap earnings of  to  in the second quarter and with respect to the full year we continue to believe we will have sales between  billion and  billion with nongaap eps in the range  to  and of course these numbers exclude our pending acquisition of ruckus and a reconciliation of our guidance is also attached to the presentation and you can too find it on our website so with that thank you very much and over to you larry larry robinson  arris international plc thanks dave now lets turn to chart  and look at the customer premises equipment highlights segment sales for the quarter finished stronger than planned with continued solid demand for our cpe products this resulted from a few key customers accelerating inventory consumption late in the quarter and we had some timing improvements in our supply availability that said as bruce indicated following a strong fourth quarter in  sales as expected were lower sequentially as settop volumes were down offset by improvements in the broadband portfolio sales were also down  as compared to q  with slight reductions in both video and broadband the mix of products for the quarter reflected  of our shipments is broadband related a trend similar to this time last year and one that we expect to continue through the remainder of the year this trend reflects the ongoing momentum around faster network speeds and improved inhome wifi solutions direct operating income was down both sequentially and yearonyear this was in part due to lower sales volumes commodity price challenges new product introductions and the effects of the strong us dollar items consistent with our discussion at our investor day conference as we look forward to the rest of  it is expected that sales will improve as compared to our q results additionally our team remains very focused on managing and improving the product cost outlook from a development pipeline perspective we have a very exciting portfolio of products coming to market later this year focused on nextgeneration capabilities including docsis  gateways incorporating rdkb and iot radio support smaller form factor k settops that support a variety of user experiences as well as products for the international market including initial platforms associated with our telefónica proteus win that we previously announced now lets turn to chart  looking at the product areas broadband portfolio sales increased sequentially dsl volumes were up as compared to both q and q of  while docsis shipments were relatively flat sequentially and lower yearoveryear during the quarter we continued to see strong customer interest in our docsis  solutions were in the process of quickly ramping production to address demand both domestically and internationally in addition we secured another significant win with a major european operator extending our market position given the progress weve made over the past several months we project to ship upwards of  million docsis  capable units by yearend a milestone which reinforces the momentum surrounding this critical technology upgrade cycle in the retail area we announced the industrys first gateway incorporating the rdkb software solution through collaboration with comcast and the rdk management team this  downstream docsis telephony gateway is intended to deliver an exceptional experience for xfinity subscribers looking to own their device we also launched our docsis  surfboard cable modem into the retail channel now lets turn to chart  and transition to video cpe highlights revenues were lower sequentially following a strong fourth quarter in all settop categories while cable maintained momentum and satellite sales improved as compared to q  telco settop volumes were down comcast indication  partners are indicating strong demand for xcompatible devices and we saw the program further expand with the rogers announcement during the quarter we anticipate this will create further opportunities for arris products in other areas we supported a north american service providers launch of a new k dvr settop incorporating a tivo user experience and cns a taiwanese cable operator announced that they selected our latest highend dvb settop incorporating our creative software this solution will support cnss all digital mandate and provide a platform to deliver next generation digital video experiences finally weve seen renewed interest particularly in the international markets for androidbased settops during the quarter we secured multiple wins with operators and have active development programs underway as i mentioned earlier looking forward in  it is expected that segment sales will improve as customers continue to invest in new platforms tied to the various broadband and video related technology upgrade cycles ill now turn it over to dan dan whalen  arris international plc thanks larry lets go to slide  and i can give a quick update on the network and cloud businesses our quarter results were a little stronger than what we had indicated last month at our investor conference with incremental demand for headend optics nodes and cmts license capacity we continue to see momentum in the industry to increase broadband capacity and extend fiber networks this has had a positive effect on our access technology business with hfc nodes split and fiber deep programs driving incremental node and optic sales as we had expected cmts sales were slower in q than prior quarters due to the impact of some shipments pulled forward in q as well as customers waiting on our second generation e line cards and as bruce had mentioned our services business was lower than prior quarters due to project seasonality for the remainder of  we expect to see continued quarteroverquarter growth as infrastructure deployment activity ramps further having positive effects on our e access technology video and services businesses we expect to see docsis  momentum continue to strengthen which will drive more cmts sales and continued hfc expansion programs we have good line of sight to continue growth in our service business and our video business is well positioned to capture investments in video hardware and software to support highdensity encoding and the ip video transition please turn to slide  as i mentioned previously our access technology business has been on a solid growth curve operators are increasing investments in fiber capacity expansion resulting in more node splits strong demand continues for headend optics optical nodes and other components supporting  gigahertz upgrades providing greater density and capacity for our customers were also involved in significant planning activities for distributed access architecture deployments and are uniquely positioned to provide this new capability in our new nodes and also in our existing nodes we are in early distributed access trials with the om optical node and believe this product and enhancements to others we already have deployed will be integral parts of msos distributed access plans which will lead to continued growth for us in this area we had strong industry engagements on the evolution of the docsis network and have architected the e ccap platform that supports the graceful migration from docsis  to docsis  and new distributed access architectures were in full production deployment with our gen upstream line card and in early trials with our gen downstream line card today while we have been striving to achieve general availability in the second quarter the downstream line card is now planned in the third quarter there is growing demand for docsis  licenses and as docsis  cpe deployments continue we should see improved sales results we are also in early trials with our e  gig epon card the e will be a foundational part of our evolution to distributed access architectures being fully capable of managing remote phy devices and believe the e will be the leading remote phy core management product trials are already under way with our remote phy solution and we expect to be in full production deployment in early  in our video systems business we announced a strategic win this quarter at starz that will help them upgrade their network to support k ultra high definition content while continuing to support standard definition content with the embedded transcoding capability of the arris transcoding receiver we have also been closely engaged with two leading msos on a new network encryptor that will help enable more programmable networking for video and advertising our cloud and service business are also well aligned with the service provider plans to increase broadband capacity we continue to see solid growth in the design upgrade and deployments of broadband networks weve also had very good results with three leading isps in helping them with fiber and data center design and deployment were continuing to develop software solutions to help service providers manage networks devices and subscribers as they adopt more wireless and docsis  technology were really excited about the outlook for the network and cloud business for the remainder of the year with current visibility to the growing bandwidth demand and also believe the existing footprint and investments weve made really differentiate arris in the future now ill turn it back to bruce bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc okay great thanks dan lets turn to slide  so to wrap up id just like to reiterate that we believe were firmly on course to achieve the objectives we outlined at our recent investor conference and if anything our confidence in our full year targets are higher at this stage the funnel activity is very solid across all verticals in our core businesses and the addition of the ruckus networks portfolio is going to be a great platform for growth into the enterprise segment as youve seen so far this year our balanced approach to the use of capital has been endorsed by our debt rating agencies as part of our term loan b refinancing and we have returned a significant portion of our free cash flow back to shareholders through timely stock repurchases we remain very focus on improving our gross margins and continuing with this balanced approach to capital management i hope we can welcome the ruckus networks team on our boat at our next earnings call update so with that bob why dont we open it up for a few questions robert puccini  arris international plc thank you bruce andrew would you come back on the line please and give instructions questionandanswer session operator sure ladies and gentlemen the questionandanswer session queue is now open well be taking our first question from the line of doug clark from goldman sachs your line is open doug clark  goldman sachs  co hey great thanks for taking my question i want to focus a little bit on the network  cloud segment first can you talk about a little bit of the visibility and the timing of the secondgeneration downstream card for q it sounds like that may be a little bit later than anticipated if you can give any details in terms of the pipeline and customer interest and then higher level given kind of the outlook for the year do you still expect – or is network  cloud expected to grow on an absolute basis in  bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yes hey doug so answer the first part of the question i guess clearly in all the discussions ive had with you and the investors weve been striving to getting to ga on the secondgen line cards the downstream card in particular by the end of second quarter and it looks like were just going to be a little bit beyond that so thats what dan had talked about so certainly a little later than we expected but its just the kind of variability in finishing tests and then getting through customer quality but i think were in good shape for third quarter and i think theres really kind of two ways to think of the upgrade cycle around gen one is kind of just a natural transition as customers buy more capacity for their networks and additional chassis et cetera there will be a natural transition to gen with twice as much capacity and density as the old generation obviously the second piece is upgrading existing footprint in the network and for the most part that happens as capacity is acquired and so we think thats kind of a natural flow of the business but i think ive always described it as not really a step function from our traditional run rate having said that as youve seen in the first quarter results were down from traditional run rates so we think that certainly comes back as the second part of the year happens as far as growth yearoveryear well just have to see how that plays out we tried to take that into account with our fullyear guidance and the whole mix of products and everything across the portfolio doug clark  goldman sachs  co all right thanks and then on the cpe side can you talk a little bit about the kind of memory cost input into the cpe segment how you guys have been managing that and if theres been any incremental headwind that youve seen since the prior quarter or the analyst day bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so ill take that first and larry can jump in at this point theres really not a lot of change from what we talked about in quite a bit of detail at the investor conference overall memory is about  of sales from a cost perspective for us so its fairly meaningful and the increase in lead times et cetera have certainly been a factor we continue to grind out additional cost reductions both through work with our partners as well as design changes to bring in additional sources for components so for the most part not a lot of change from a month ago larry i dont know if any other thoughts on that larry robinson  arris international plc no i would agree with bruces comments not a lot of change i would say we continue from a supplier perspective to be engaged with the major memory providers to ensure on continuity of supply that we have visibility of that which we do and just continue to manage ill say on most daily basis understanding what the economics look like but no real notable change from our discussion up in new york bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc its certainly an active area these days with the new gc around toshibas business and i think additional capacity planning et cetera so well just have to see as the year progresses here what sort of changes we might see doug clark  goldman sachs  co great i appreciate that and then if i can sneak in a quick one for dave the buyback activity youre clearly doing a little bit of buybacks before ruckus closes do you still anticipate pulling back on buybacks around the time that that closes or shortly thereafter or is this something that we could continue to see david b potts  arris international plc i think it will all depend and well certainly have discussions with our board about it but obviously its all about the intrinsic value of the stock and just how the cash is assembling before the ruckus transaction but fair to say that we do view repurchases as one of the key portions of our allocation strategy at this stage doug clark  goldman sachs  co taking my questions bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc thanks doug larry robinson  arris international plc thanks doug operator our next question comes from the line of george notter from jefferies your line is open george c notter  jefferies llc hi guys thanks very much i guess i wanted to come back to the gen downstream line cards for docsis  can you tell us like why precisely is that slipping out it seems a bit strange in the company has gone through many generations of line card deliveries over the years and i guess im just wondering kind of whats happening here executionwise its kind of hurting you and then also you talked about i think for a number of quarters now we talked about pentup demand around those line cards and now it sounds like you dont think theres quite as much im just trying to understand whats changing there in terms of your views on pentup demand for that line card and when we might start to see any pentup demand kind of flow through numbers going forward thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so i guess – and dan can jump in from a general availability full production revenue rec et cetera we were looking at late in the quarter so it doesnt take much to move from june to july or into the third quarter so nothing alarming or special there there is a fairly extensive customer qualification process we go through with new hardware and software and theres just some variability in that in the meantime as you can see the business continues to operate theres continued demand for the product and we continue to ship in pretty decent volumes so its just kind of a natural ebb and flow of the business from a docsis  perspective the product that we have in deployment today supports docsis  completely and were already upgrading networks and whatnot with  what the new downstream card gives us is additional capacity and density right dan dan whalen  arris international plc yeah it gives us additional capacity density really puts us on top of leading in that technology space from a density perspective and the numbers do improve as the year comes out we start seeing the second half exit more traditional the way weve seen traditional spend in this space happening as we move through the rest of the year with the ccap platform bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah dan whalen  arris international plc so we do see an increment but there is pentup demand it just gets back to traditional spending levels we think as we go through the rest of the year george c notter  jefferies llc all right so if i look back on q i think that was – when we took down expectations for the year i guess exiting q and heading into q one of the pieces of rationale around that reduction was a delay in gen line cards so i guess my question is did you in fact see that softness then materialize in q or is that something that customers just didnt care and just continue to buy the gen version of line card is that what happened in fact bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc well one of the key reasons q is softer than traditional is certainly what weve characterized as a bit of a wait for for gen and as we think about the full year obviously weve taken that into account as we provided the guidance for the full year and i think weve tried to indicate here were certainly incrementally more positive on that plan for the year so i think were feeling good about it george george c notter  jefferies llc yeah okay fair enough thanks very much bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah thank you larry robinson  arris international plc thanks george operator our next question comes from the line of simon leopold from raymond james your line is open simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc thank you for taking my question just want to start off with just maybe a quick clarification in the comments you indicated that you are maintaining the fullyear guidance and i think dave even said you feel a little bit better about it but just to help everybody out what metrics are you reiterating in terms of that fullyear guidance just maybe some clarification specifically sales eps david b potts  arris international plc yeah the  million to  million and the  to  simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great i appreciate that and then in terms of david b potts  arris international plc did i answer your question simon simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc yes yeah david b potts  arris international plc okay simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc thats good so in terms of the issues with memory understand that thats pressuring the gross margin currently but given that youve offered some full year expectations for earnings what assumptions have you made in terms of the memory cost pressures are you assuming that they stay where they are they get worse they get better and whats the timeline where you stop forecasting memory cost bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so i guess the way to think of it is in two pieces one is around the dram component the other is around flash and both weve got visibility and kind of supply locked in through at least through third quarter given the lead times and the fact that were running our own factories our production planning goes out at least that far and then i think weve got a pretty good view on what the fourth quarter looks like from a ill call it a not to exceed perspective so thats really the way weve come at it and again i think were incrementally positive on as dave said both revenue and margin and ultimately on eps here a – de dave potts and i dont think our perspective on memory has changed much from when we were together in new york to be honest with you bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc right simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc thats helpful and then in terms of maybe bigger picture trending i wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the satellite opportunities and maybe include some reflection on what you had anticipated that opportunity would look like when you made the decision to acquire pace and then how you think about that opportunity today because i guess from our perspective it seems as if maybe the satellite opportunity did not materialize as expected maybe not when expected and i want a better sense of how to think about where you see it today thank you bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah thanks simon so i think theres a larry a variety of different ways to think about satellite the biggest thing thats changed is att and directv have come together is – theres effectively one less video provider in the us market and so i think that colors somewhat the overall addressable market its not att and directv its a combined business at this point as we look at the satellite business internationally this is sky this is multichoice its foxtel et cetera around the world i think we feel pretty good about how the business is performing larry larry robinson  arris international plc yeah no i would agree i think from my perspective it continues to be an important part of the portfolio when i look at settops overall i mean the reality is theres a lot of commonality in the backend processing right so its really the access network so from my perspective i think it continues to be an important part of the portfolio and one from a development standpoint we continue to still get a lot of leverage out of bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc the other variable i think thats effected the business thats more notable is in the south american region with the economic environment in brazil in particular which again was one of our strongest markets in south america one of the strongest international markets for both arris and pace thats been just a really soft point for the last  months and continues through today having said that there are signs around the economic climate in brazil stabilizing starting to improve i think well start to see some investment there in the second half of the year but thats been very challenging for us and others certainly and creates a headwind from a growth perspective youve got to overcome that before you can start to grow simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc so you did say international was up significantly i think  yearoveryear where was that coming from so brazil sounds like stabilizing which is good news but where is the strength coming from then bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah i think the two strongest markets for us has been canada and europe and europe on the strength of the relationship with liberty global and telefónica and several others of course as weve talked about before the business in australia with nbn with telstra and with foxtel has been very good and so thats  as well simon m leopold  raymond james  associates inc great thank you for taking my questions larry robinson  arris international plc thanks simon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mitch steves from rbc capital markets your line is open mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc hey guys thanks for taking my question so the first i kind of want to drill down a little bit on the gross margin side so im trying to back into kind of the  to  for june so how do we think about the gross margins expanding from where they are today and as we work through the rest of the full year bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so obviously its made up of largely a mix question of the types of products we ship in second quarter and i think if you do your model youll see gross margins improving a little bit in the second quarter not dramatically and then as volume starts to increase again around networking cloud well have more margin expansion as the year progresses mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it and then is that mix shift going to essentially overtake the memory pricing issues that everybody in kind of the space is seeing at this point bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc well i guess again if you do the model we are expecting our business to increase incrementally as the year progresses so it starts to make a dent in the memory issue clearly were growing as the year progresses so i guess thats one way to look at it but the reality is wed be growing faster our margins would be better without the memory problem and its been a big deal i mean clearly we talked about it mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it and then just one small one are you guys reiterating the  million cash flow for the full year david b potts  arris international plc well as ive said at the analyst day it will all depend upon some working capital so i did mention that we did see receivables drop considerably in the first quarter as we expected it would assuming that kind of sticks with us and that should work out fine but well see what happens at the end of the year if its more of a bit of normal pattern bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc we think thats the right range david b potts  arris international plc thats the way to look at it bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah david b potts  arris international plc well see mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc got it thank you bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc thanks mitch operator thank you our next question comes from the line rich valera from needham your line is open rich f valera  needham  co llc thank you bruce i was hoping you could lay out maybe the two or three things that make you more incrementally confident about the fullyear outlook im not sure if i was clear on exactly what that was thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah i dont think we detailed in a lot of ways its a variety of different places i talked about international i mean gosh its great to see the strength in the international business and these are either kind of ongoing cpe refresh cycles new nextgeneration k settops docsis gateways or some of the infrastructure products that dan talked about so we just have a variety of programs with customers that we see continuing and maybe accelerating a little bit from we were a month ago larry mentioned i think he caught right the docsis  volume expectation for this year and i think i even mentioned this in the investor conference but it was incrementally more positive were ramping production to try and keep up with nearterm demand right now as larry mentioned upwards of  million units this year those are some of the reasons why were feeling a little better visibilitys improved and well see how the year progresses but thats the current feel on the business rich f valera  needham  co llc got it so it sounds like two things youd point to would be strength in international and strength in d  cpe bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc right rich f valera  needham  co llc kind of two meaningful factors there bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yes rich f valera  needham  co llc great and then just wanted to get your – i know you had some prepared remarks with respect to distributed access and remote phy but bruce just wanted to hear you or maybe dan talk about your thoughts on kind of where the industry is with respect to both of these and kind of time to meaningful deployments i think your competitor the other night was talking about potentially a lot of activity in  in those areas and it sounded like maybe a little earlier than you guys had suggested at your analyst day so i just wanted to get your sense of the timing on those two kind of new architectural sort of shifts if you will bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah well its a its a complex topic as you know to address in a sound bite on an earnings call rich f valera  needham  co llc sure bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc and a variety of different approaches that customers are taking and of course its all relative to where youre sitting today so for us with a multi hundreds million dollar business billion dollar a couple billion dollars around network access thinking about it being just a huge part of  maybe we just have a little perspective on it but clearly theres building momentum in the way weve designed both our ccap platform as well as our node platform since were able to leverage those assets and upgrade them to support this distributed access architecture and i think we see  definitely as commercial deployments dan as you talked about it right well be in general availability and commercial deployments of a remote phy implementation and be interoperable with other suppliers et cetera in  so now whether its a massive change over from what were doing today thats a different question i think right therell be a lot of different approaches here to add capacity in the network dan whalen  arris international plc yeah certainly at the tops of the minds of all of our major customers were in discussions with all of them on this topic and theyre all doing it and as bruce mentioned there are different approaches and reasons why theyre looking at it and in many cases its somewhat incremental to the business we have today its not necessarily a replacement the way theyre looking to use the technology initially and then over time as it gets more – becomes more of a standard approach inside of the industry they start looking at this as being the means for adding more capacity to their network over time bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah rich f valera  needham  co llc got it and then just one more if could it sounds like access technology continues to see strong demand and you expected another at least solid year there any updated color on access technology do we think that that business grows this year or kind of continued steadyasshegoes from last year bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc well i think we definitely have an opportunity to grow that business this year its one of the highlights it is constructionproject related so theres some ebbs and flows and one project will finish another one will start et cetera so it can be a little variable and theres some seasonality to it from a construction season perspective again some of it will depend on what happens in the international markets again yearandahalf ago brazil was one of the strongest markets for our access business its down so youve got to kind of overcome that to grow and – so there are some variables there but its a great business very strong business for us rich f valera  needham  co llc thats great thanks very much gentlemen bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc all right thanks rich operator thank you our next question comes from the line of – please forgive me if i mispronounce – greg mesniaeff from drexel hamilton your line is open greg mesniaeff  drexel hamilton llc yeah thank you that was right question on the services business if you can give us some color how that tracked in the quarter and what generally youve been seeing as far as customer trends for service and support activities from you guys i know some of your competitors have seen a pickup in that activity and its actually impacted margins negatively so im curious what kind of read you guys have on that thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so it is a business thats been growing for us yearoveryear and we do expect it to grow again this year its a very – obviously a human capitalintensive business so youve got to have the right talent in the right place to execute well it does tend to have a ill call it a seasonality to it where in the beginning of the year our revenue recognition on projects is lower and they tend to catch up as you complete projects as the year progresses so generally then q ends up being our weakest revenue quarter q usually ends up being our strongest around services dan whalen  arris international plc absolutely and we are seeing increased demand in that area a bit some of the new technologies transitions and evolution of the network creates opportunities to move into what i call a strategic outsourcing model and weve seen a lot of increase in activity in that area with our customers and have taken on as bruce mentioned some incremental projects in that area bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc so we are bullish about the ability to grow that business we are careful and ill call it selective around where the right places to engage are because if you get it wrong you can end up upside down pretty quickly so were trying to grow it at a sustainable pace thats profitable for the business and complementary to the rest of our products greg mesniaeff  drexel hamilton llc and what kind of impact have you seen so far on your blended margin gross margin from this business bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah so we dont break it out i think ill decide not to answer that for now greg till it becomes more a larger part of the business greg mesniaeff  drexel hamilton llc sure got you okay thank you bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc okay thanks greg david b potts  arris international plc thanks greg operator thank you our next question comes from the line of – pardon me if i – i think this may have been misspelled meta marshall from morgan stanley meta a marshall  morgan stanley  co llc spelled right operator oh pardon me meta a marshall  morgan stanley  co llc just a couple of questions for you circling back to ruckus obviously that transaction hasnt closed yet but just if you could address some of the preplanning thats going on or whether kind of management roles have been identified particularly as it comes to kind of running a lot of enterprise business standalone versus maybe taking some of the service provider business and running it more as a part of arris and then the second question kind of jumps on what rich asked about of whether just seeing carriers take a little bit longer as they decide what architectures to go forward with in their decisionmaking or the fact that your equipment is backward compatible does that kind of shorten the decision cycles that youre seeing thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc hi meta thats great so i guess on ruckus first so now that were through regulatory approval from a competitive perspective we continue with the integration planning so these are typically more backoffice system oriented how do you run the business post acquisition erp systems those sorts of things as i think i described at the investor conference we are going to run the business as a separate segment in the company and given the enterprise and the channel infrastructure is quite a bit different than how we run the business today well run that as a kind of a complete ill call it standalone or independent business unit with sales and engineering product management all integrated together under dan rabinovitsj whos the leader over there today and theres obviously integration activity around some of the other parts of the operation finance and hr et cetera and as far as we go to market towards our combined service provider customers a need to integrate and work  very closely there but i think weve got a really clear strategy on how the companies come together and lots of enthusiasm both from employees and from customers and channel partners about moving forward and again were thinking were at kind of at the first part of august at this point well just see how kind of the final couple of months play out here on your second question hope that caught that one on the second question around architectures i think theres different approaches again we have some customers that have really kind of locked in on what their short midterm longterm strategy looks like and the types of products and theyre driving road map decisions and product development very actively on a daytoday basis with us and others and then theres others that are very focused on continuing to build out capacity with traditional mechanisms that are tried and true and worked very well theres some debate in the industry about how much active electronics that you want to have out in the infrastructure its kind of the antithesis of a passive optical network and so not everyones onboard with that idea necessarily so there is a bit of bifurcation around how to build a network how to evolve and how to manage it so those are some of the variables i think people think through as they think about their infrastructure meta a marshall  morgan stanley  co llc got it thank you bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc thanks meta operator our next question comes from the line of tim savageaux from northland capital markets your line is open tim savageaux  northland securities inc wow just rolls right through savageaux thats impressive wanted to ask a quick question on the access and transport business i think there were commentary around continued strength there sort of i guess maybe standing out in the network and cloud unit and i think going back to the analyst day i think there was a reference there to sort of building on doubledigit growth i wonder if you can talk about how you see that playing out for the year in the fiber optic access in particular and to what extent thats emerging as a significant growth driver in network and cloud thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah thanks tim well i dont know if i can put a finer point on it at this point i mean its clearly one of the stars in the business weve put a lot of effort into increasing capacity to make sure we can reduce lead times with customers be more responsive to their growth and these are multiyear construction cycles one of the biggest limitations today is just finding the right construction labor and getting building permits and whatnot to go more quickly and so i think theres a natural governor or throttle on just how fast our customers can go and i think ive mentioned to some of you if you talk to our customers it makes us sound like its going even faster than what were saying and i think they would go faster if they could and so i think those are some of the variables that prevent us from giving you a very specific growth rate number obviously weve tried to take that into account in the annual guidance and part of our incremental optimism on achieving that i think is around some of these products with our customers tim savageaux  northland securities inc great and if i could follow up briefly in terms of the kind of margin expansion both in q and throughout the year to the extent there is a mix impact i mean are you expecting that to be kind of more network and cloud heavy in the quarter and throughout the year are we talking about mix within cpe or i wonder if you had any comments on that bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc yeah well its yes larry robinson  arris international plc all of the above bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc certainly the biggest mix factor i think is between the network and cloud and cpe but even within each of those product families theres variability and again we talked before if were ramping a new product thats got a bunch of dram in it margins are just not where we want them to be on those products so the more you sell of those the more they may drag down the overall gross margin so theyre – just there are a lot of variables that go into the math tim savageaux  northland securities inc okay thanks bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc okay tim thank you operator no other questions in the queue at this time id like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments robert puccini  arris international plc thanks andrew bruce any final words bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc well great so we appreciate the call lots of great questions and again we kind of reiterate were on track here and we look forward to seeing everyone at the next show and certainly on the next call in august robert puccini  arris international plc great bruce william mcclelland  arris international plc thank you robert puccini

earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their

the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp

fell  today the communications networking specialist beat expectations in the fourth quarter setting itself up for a fall in the next period anders bylund tmfzahrim feb   at pm what happened shares of communications networking equipment maker arris international nasdaqarrs fell as much as  thursday morning following the release of preliminary fourthquarter results and an acquisition announcement involving two divisions from broadcom nasdaqavgo and brocade nasdaqbrcd so what first arris published a downright solid earnings report bolstered by the acquisition of settop box specialist pace which closed at the very beginning of fiscal year  the company reported strong growth across the board earnings increased  year over year to land at  billion while adjusted earnings of  per share represented a  annual increase both figures exceeded wall streets best guesses moreover the order backlog surged  higher on a booktobill ratio just above the magic  mark providing arris investors with significant visibility into revenue strength for the next few quarters image source getty images separately arris also announced a  million allcash buyout of broadcoms ruckus wireless and brocade icx switch operations the deal will add economies of scale to arris broadly similar product portfolio while allowing the pending broadcombrocade merger to meet its regulatory requirements and wrap things up now what ruckus and icx switch will technically remain brocade businesses until the broadcom merger is completed which is where arris takes over the reins its like watching three oil tankers making uturns around each other in the english channel but it all seems to be working out market makers are not punishing arris for this deal either  it actually makes good strategic sense and should pay for itself in cost synergies and elevated cash flows over the next few years instead todays sellers are focusing on guidance figures that paint a bleak picture for the first quarter of  ceo bruce mcclelland said that the first quarter will be slow for a number of very specific reasons these effects include the closing of a large customers call center contract currency effects in latin america normal quarterly seasonality and a technology transition in arris cable networking products furthermore unexpectedly strong sales in the fourth quarter left some customers with overloaded inventories reducing their need for additional orders at this time in all arris comes with a lot of moving parts right now if any of this stuff  or all of it  left you scratching your head its probably best to hold your horses until this period of rapid business changes blows over the stock is neither overvalued nor particularly cheap today and management could probably use some time to integrate the rash of recent acquisitions anders bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends broadcom the motley fool has a disclosure policy author anders bylund tmfzahrim anders bylund is

pwm signal as well as software counters ramps and pids programmed with software youll enjoy using  graphically program in flow charts andor ladder logic to rapidly create custom applications we simplified the instruction set our function set is comprehensive easy to use and powerful no hunting for features vbuilder’s layout keeps the tools and information you need in plain view warnings and errors are presented in real time so there are no surprises at build tag based plcs are easier to use than address based ones but typically cost hundreds of dollars our entire line starting at  is tag based innovative features we’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably subroutines break projects up into manageable chunks and allow program reuse objects isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency maintainability and reliability linked subroutines specify that multiple subroutines should use the same objects maybe you’ve got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine and a process you want in another they can share an object so you don’t have to pass data between the two view your data and create operator controls with awesome free hmi we’re serious about delivering the easiest to use most productive plc software we could go on about our features but seeing is believing so check out our vbuilder page vfactory page or download vbuilder and vfactory theyre free meet branch expansion has a vlink input port instead of usb expansions are otherwise physically identical to branch main your sensors and actuators are branched out your plc should branch with them branchs unique structure beats backplane and brick systems at getting io where it’s need helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system smarter io expansion units have full plc processing power and memory vbuilder’s power shines with branch put subroutines inside of io units to focus processing where it’s most needed debug your entire branch system as a unit no need to debug one processor at a time lets you view realtime data for your entire system plc programming should be fun we’ve got engaging tutorials
