situations growthsummarycash and cash equivalents along with the office building alone provide a floor value of  per sharegaia has divested all the unrelated businesses and is focusing solely on online video subscription service business which has tremendous growth potentialgaias founder jirka rysavy has a fantastic track record and has more skin in the game than any other shareholderas on april   gaia inc nasdaqgaia has reached week high of  and was last trading at  with market cap of  million gaia previously gaiam inc was incorporated in colorado in july  and operates as a global digital video subscription service gaia has recently streamlined its operations and became more focused on online video subscription service business gaia has divested its several other unrelated businesses such as solar energy business rgs energy nasdaqrgse dvd distribution business gaiambranded consumer product business and ecotravel subsidiary and sold off investments in natural habitat gaia is investing these proceeds to grow its online video subscription business gaias business model is similar to that of netflix nasdaqnflx amazon prime nasdaqamzn hulu plus and hbo while content of other players is mostly entertainmentdriven and licensebased gaias content is niche type with copyrights over own inhouse produced content and exclusive licensing agreements gaia operates through four content channels i yoga  yoga eastern arts like tai chi qigong ayurveda etc ii transformation  content in alternative health spiritual growth and expanded consciousness for a stronger healthier productive and enlightened lives iii seeking truth  interviews with and presentations from thought leaders in topics like ancient wisdom metaphysics etc iv films  docs  inspirational films critically acclaimed documentaries and thoughtprovoking short films the fourth channel was not mentioned in the annual report  but is available on gaia app as per annual report  gaia has a library of over  titles in total approximately  of this content is produced inhouse with production studios and media professionals rights over remaining content are acquired through exclusive licensing agreements having tenure ranging from  to  years paying subscribers have access to over  of the titles and they can either watch them through streaming or download them and watch offline gaia is accessible on all major devices and platforms apple tv ipad iphone roku chromecast android devices including phones tablets and amazon fire laptops desktop computers and tv through a hdmi chord gaia app is available on itunes and google play store i have downloaded the app on my android phone and explored the content i must say the user interface and the sample content i have checked out are pretty impressive on an average the videos on the app have over  likes following are the reasons i find gaia a very attractive investment opportunity i cash balance as on december   is  million and the company envisages capex of  million for fy  and this capex will be funded through the cash balance with shares outstanding of  million ignoring dilution this should translate roughly into  cash per share and  cash per share postcapex respectively the company owns its  sq ft office building in louisville co based on the information from realtorcom residential properties in louisville co fetch a market rate of approximately  for sq ft and applying same rate for this property should translate to approximately  million value ie  per share this establishes a floor of  per share the above calculation does not include media library investments and other assets including these the liquidation value could be over  per share that way the investor is paying  for future growth of the operating business which i consider is very cheap given the scalability of the business ii the company achieved subscriber growth rates of  and  in  and  respectively and expects this rate to be at  in  subscriber base of gaia as on december   is approximately  and gaia believes that size of its potential target market to be approximately  of the global video subscription service market ie subscriber base of  million by  the company expects to build a subscriber base of  million achieve revenue of  million and pretax income of  million i strongly believe that the gaia should be able to achieve the subscriber base of  million sooner than  for following reasons working professionals particularly those aged above  live stressful lives and would always be interested in content that would be useful for their wellbeing for example over  of the messages pictures and videos that i receive over whatsapp on my phone are a quotes from eminent personalities b healthrelated tips c transformational  personality development videos etc and as soon as i find some content useful i have a tendency to forward them to my friends colleagues and wellwishers i think same is the case with most of the people applying the same analogy to gaia anybody who has come across gaia app content would definitely recommendrefer it to somebody they care about gaia subscription fee is relatively cheap pricing plans for gaia subscription are  per month  cents for first month  for three months and  per month thereafter  per annum my wife and i used to go to yoga classes earlier and we were taught and used to do almost the same routine week after week throughout the year and we used to pay combined fee of approximately  per annum compared to this annual subscription fee of gaia looks very cheap and people living under one roof could just do with one subscription plan as a bonus we would get access to variety of content in yoga and other categories as well gaias founder jirka rysavy has a history of overpromising and overachieving his first venture corporate express an office supplies wholesaler had revenues of  million in  at the time of acquiring trick  murray with revenues of  million in  jirka proclaimed that he would grow corporate express to  million revenues by  for  corporate express had revenues of  billion with rich content relatively cheaper subscription plans and an existing subscriber base of  gaia should be able to compound the subscriber base and revenues at faster rates under the guidance of jirka rysavy let us assume that the company does meet its projected targets for  even with slowdown in growth rate to  after  it would take seven years for gaia to reach its potential target subscriber base of  million using the pretax income of  million in   growth rate and cash contribution margin of  as described in company presentations if we do some backoftheenvelope calculations using dcf the companys stock could be worth another  in addition to the floor value we have mentioned earlier however these projections are farfetched and i am just trying to indicate the potential of the business the business model is proven and anybody who has seen the growth of the likes of netflix amazon prime etc in past decade or so would subscribe to this this business has a huge potential for scalability worldwide through minor modifications such as adding foreign language support without having to invest in local foreign operations as on date  subscribers are outside the us and the company expects this to be at  in five years and at  in  years iii jirka rysavy has an impeccable track record in starting from scratch and building multibillion dollar businesses corporate express was started in  with  employees and was sold to buhrmann a dutch conglomerate at  billion in  and had  billion of revenues at the time of its sale his another venture crystal market was sold to wild oats which was later sold to whole foods nasdaqwfm in  gaia sold its equity investment in natural habitat and gaiam brand business for combined gains of  million with an investment of  million in natural habitat gaia made a profit of approximately  million over  over a period of a decade and a half as per annual report  jirka rysavy has  shareholding in the company and  of total voting rights thus exercising significant control the shareholding and voting rights have increased by almost  from the previous year as on may   the shares were trading at  and post the tender offer shares were trading at  on may   the tender offer presented a gain of  to the shareholders tender offer resulted in higher equity interest for the management and increased shareholder value founders shareholding and the tender offer indicate companys super confidence about its prospects iv gaia has no debt on its balance sheet in future also the company expects itself to be fully funded out of own cash accruals with prepaid subscription revenues and zero inventory gaia expects itself to operate on negative working capital v as indicated by its management in conference calls there is a possibility for the tender offers for share repurchases and dividends in the near future thus increasing the value for the shareholders in the distant future assuming gaia builds a significant subscriber base there is a possibility of merger withtakeover by one of the larger players which could also be beneficial for the shareholders of gaia also there is always a possibility of expanding the media library and business by acquiring other niche content providers vi given that gaia is a microcap company and its founder usually prefers to stay out of the limelight the stock was under the radar and that could be the reason the stock was trading at lower prices having said that some of the risks associated with the stock are described as hereunder i at present it seems adfree streaming could be one of the features helping gaia in building brand loyalty apart from that gaia seems to have no other strong brand loyalty point and it would not be very hard for its larger competitors to replicate the business model and content with the kind of resources at their disposal for example though gaia has copyrights over the yogarelated content produced inhouse similar videos can be made with other established yoga practitioners as the underlying principles and exercises are same gaias presentation in september  indicates that  of gaias subscribers also have netflix subscription now imagine a scenario where netflix comes up with content similar to gaia adds a separate category to its existing media library and marginally increases the price for overall subscription plan this would drive pricesensitive customers away from gaia as they would be gaining access to vast media library at lower subscription prices ii i believe there is a significant potential for dilution the total no of class a shares to be issuedremaining available for future issuance upon exercise of options warrants and rights stands at approximately  million compare this with  million class a shares outstanding at present and that indicates a possibility for significant dilution however in one of its conference calls the management has indicated that it would like to go for more stock repurchases and dividends in the future since the management had carried out a tender offer for repurchase of shares and options in mayjuly  for an amount of approximately  million i believe the management would walk the talk in future as well overall i believe that investment in gaia could fetch  return in next couple of years and over a period of five years the returns could be even higher supporting documents gaiakpdf disclosure iwe have no positions in
