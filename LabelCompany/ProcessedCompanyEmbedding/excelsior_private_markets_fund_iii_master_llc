conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated entity and the whollyowned investment subsidiary the regulated entitys board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subsidiarys participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated entitys board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a

subsidiaries the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated entity and the whollyowned investment subsidiary  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated entity the relevant adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated entity the advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification  other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the applicable adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote on that coinvestment transaction the “eligible directors”  and the majority of such managers of the board who are independent managers a “required majority” will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated entity  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated entity and each affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the
