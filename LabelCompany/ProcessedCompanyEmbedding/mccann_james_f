originally approved doing a house bank mortgage over their budget of  monthly when all alongthe bank knew that their bothincomes of governement incometotaled monthly of  at closing on for a new construction  housein the howard beach area of hamilton beach nyit was partly the fault of the bank approving such a high mortgage to begin with and the other half the fault of our builderthat made a breach of warranty contract refusing to make any house repairs from our flood house ins claims  thru jan   when the  police  hb fire dept founded over  counts of deadly carbon monixode in the unfinshed basement at that timewe had to try  live in a house that was safe and at that time we did not have the help ofour house builder under warrantyto do so and we just found out recently about a law that protects new construction homeowners in nys from exluding them to make any mortgage house payments due to the fact the house was not liveable called warranty of habitability lawwe hope that

blessing for us through the whole extensive immigration process he is extremely knowledgeable unbelievably patient and tactful with people and he has an amazing personality mr weinman deserves not all the  rating stars but  and i will be very specific with you as i have been in the position of a person who reads tons of reviews looking for a good lawyer lets start with the fact that before hiring mr weinman i personally met with about  lawyers some of them even recommended by friends the problem was that i wasnt happy with any of them i worked for  years as a human resource specialist and i have the training to recognize the people that can get the job done frankly spoken some of the lawyers i met at that time were very convincing but i was also very wellprepared for my appointments with them and at the end they didnt seem to me either very competent or honest enough or something else was missing then i was browsing online reading different reviews and i found mr weinman there were several nice reviews and i decided to try with an initial appointment yet when you open the door you see that his office is organized in a manner that is only possible for someone confident knowledgeable and honest the next pleasant surprise was that he doesnt make you wait and he doesnt need to as he gains immediately the clients respect with his positive and honest approach and his extensive knowledge we discussed l visa h visa e and e and i decided to hire him right on the spot  months later i am so happy with my decision because he helped my mother then my father and then my best friend  out of  absolutely successful cases two of them i know were extremely difficult thank you mr weinman you are a true blessing for me and my family and for those of you who took the time to read my review i wish you just a little good luck because i know now that you will be in the hands of a great lawyerlaw office of ganesh n viswanathan esqmaria r ratedi am a woman from the caribbean island and even though i have been living here for a number of years i have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation a person who is from the same islands married me a decade and half ago and we have a child after many years into the marriage i was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce over the years he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work i was not aware of any of his assets one day he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened he never served on me directly but was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order with no disclosure and no distribution to me i was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright because my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence i went and checked the court and to my horror i found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago this is the time when i somehow came into contact mr viswanathans office and his office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me my law office immediately moved the court and in detail put forth in the papers before the court everything that happened now my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations i shall be entitled to a share in his assets further i am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support i did not even imagine that i would be entitled to a penny from my husband all because of the great investigative legal work carried out by mr viswanathan and his excellent team i am now so happy because of their great work my husband whom i meet every week is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed  for the betterthe law office of lance fletcherkurtnyc ratedstop looking around the internet and just read i just got a new job and my coworkers took me out for a celebration we went out for drinks and to make matters worse i started drinking shots big mistake because i had several im done with shots from this point on i got into a fight  apparently  i dont remember the details but i woke up in a cell with cuts and bruises i got charged with assault for hitting a guy and pushing him to the ground and resisting arrest and i thought my life was over because you cant get a good job with a record i was scared frustrated confused and i started looking around for a good lawyer to take my case i came across lance fletchers website and it looked pretty good you never know if that means its gonna be a good lawyer so i called him for a consultation when i went to see him i was a nervous reck and couldnt sleep i didnt want to lose my job or go to jail during the consultation we discussed similar cases hes had like mine turns out hes a former prosecutor and he really knew what he was talkin about after i saw him i had the best nights sleep since the arrest he looked me in the eye and explained how he was going to keep my record clean and fight the case most of the lawyers i spoke to just wanted money right away but mr fletcher was more interested in me and the case he took the time to meet and discuss the details on the first court date he filed a motion to dismiss he got a copy of the medical records saw that the other guy wasnt really hurt and got the da to drop the criminal charges i had to do a brief anger class but i avoided jail and no criminal record i got to keep my job and i cant thank him enough one thing  i wish i saw him sooner because my family tried to set me up with a lawyer but that guy didnt know what he was talking about and had me pretty scared turk hugh m jdperry ratedthere was little to no response not even taking two minutes to send a followup email or telephone call to my many inquiries for help with my case from one of the lawyers and his secretary of this firm the wheels of justice may move at a very slow pace yet apparently something else was going on here undoubtedly they are preoccupied with larger concerns however if certain people within this office are unable unwilling or uninterested in assisting the one who is inexperienced in legal matters perhaps with unrealistic expectations yet unfortunately forced into a legal circumstance though small in scope then simply say so but please do not ignore an individual for monthsespecially after promising to help initially you had given hope to this expunged criminal and after he pleaded again and again for assistance some action was finally taken now it appears it is all over the abusive unchecked and condescending authorities have won the incurring frustration seemingly endless wait as well as the expensive fees were paid by this innocent victim and despite the adversities and disappointments he will go on wishing well of authorities legal professionals and most of all hoping to be safeguarded from both professions since he is simply a lawabiding citizen who probably needs to forget the injustice committed against him and only wants to make his way in this world with malice toward none may there be mutual respect honesty and compassion among all peoples and our various ways of lifelaw offices of lauren goldberg pllceli b ratedi had lost all hope that i would get through

season i reached out to a few referrals from friends and neither of those attorneys got back to me however through some online research i came across great reviews of the law offices of paul kenney which is conveniently located on the upper west side in a more serene location than the insanity of midtown and wall st paul responded to my inquiry right away and was wonderful with followup from there on out his fees were incredibly reasonable and i had no idea how much easier the process would be with him facilitating our first meeting took away all the mounting anxiety i had accumulated and the entire process became painless and stressfree paul managed to get all that i wanted put into the contract and approved he has a unique talent for finding the right approach in handling the eccentric and sometimes difficult characters that saturate the real estate market in nyc his savvy and pleasant disposition completely disarmed the other party he made himself available to me for any questions or concerns that popped up and was incredibly diligent in handling all the details i would absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a real estate attorneylaw office of paul r kenneylara b ratedi was suddenly thrown into a roommate battle with a friend i had lived with for over a year regarding a sublease and frantically started searching for tenant lawyers paul was the very first to get back to me and after hearing my story he was very straight forward and clear in explaining what my options were he wasnt intimidating to talk to and didnt ask for payment before telling me his opinion and advice this unofficial consultation would have cost over  for at the other lawyers i had reached out to as quoted in their emails i told him id like to continue working with him until the issue was solved and he became my savior through the whole process he worked with my roommates lawyer to settle the issues and kept me updated every step of the way even when i got nervous and would call him at random times during the day he took my call and would reassure me that he is on top of the situation and that he would continue to work on any other issues that arose with her when all the issues were resolved he stuck to the very reasonable price that he originally quoted me  no surprise fees or over charges i would recommend him to any and all of my friends and i would go back to him in a heartbeat i feel very lucky to have found him the law office of lance fletcherscottm ratedi hired this lawyer for a felony a very unfortunate thing happened over the holidays while i was on probation for dwi i got arrested again for the same thing i was so scared i couldnt sleep at night the judge let me out on bail and i found the law office of lance fletcher online when i called i was able to speak with mr fletcher right away he was smart and honest and a good guy from the moment i first met him his passion and confidence really impressed me during the case he kept in touch about things the da was trying to do to me it looked like i was going to jail for a while buy mr fletcher said we had to keep fighting and giving them motions and push for better it was all good in the end because i got off with only a fine some classes and no driving for a while i even avoided a felony record i still cant believe i stayed out of jail every other lawyer i talked to before hiring mr

fraud by steve eder richard sandomir and alison leigh cowandec   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this article is by steve eder richard sandomir and alison leigh cowanin march  a group of online retailers was sued in federal court accused of having participated in a cynical and longstanding scheme to cheat customers out of millions of dollars one of the named defendants is flowerscom inc which says it is the world’s leading florist and gift shopthe plaintiffs said the system worked this way a customer perhaps racing to buy flowers online for mother’s day would enter a credit card number click “purchase” and then be offered a cashback rebate if the customer clicked on the rebate option and failed to read the fine print however he or she wound up registering for a nearworthless club membership that would charge the credit card for months sometimes years before the expenses on the credit card statements were detected outfits like flowerscom received a cut of the operation what regulators and others have called “bounties”a recent legal filing by lawyers in the case asserted that “flowers was well aware that its customers were getting defrauded”shortly after the lawsuit was filed in connecticut last spring the founder and chief executive of flowerscom officially became a minority owner of the mets the company executive james f mccann had been selected by the team’s owners as one of a handful of investors whose infusion of cash was needed to help rescue the mets from a financial crisis advertisement continue reading the main story the team’s owners fred wilpon and saul katz have never told the public or fans the identity of the emergency investors — and new part owners but mccann whose company has long been an official sponsor of the mets and whose advertisements are prominently displayed at citi field has acknowledged that he now owns a small chunk of the team continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it is unclear if wilpon and katz knew that mccann’s company had been accused of defrauding customersbut a review of flowerscom’s legal problems makes clear that the  lawsuit is hardly the first time someone has accused mccann’s business of knowingly participating in defrauding customers — with some of its victims quite possibly mets fans given the company’s aggressive marketing to the team’s loyal supporterstwo years ago a lawsuit was filed in federal court in long island claiming consumer fraud and racketeering violations against flowerscom and other companies alleging they had worked together to “levy unauthorized charges on the unsuspecting consumers’ credit or debit card accounts” by inducing customers to pay for memberships to discount clubs without their knowledgethat lawsuit now in the process of being consolidated with the connecticut case came after the new york attorney general at the time andrew m cuomo launched an investigation into the “discount club” industry finding that flowerscom and other companies had “tricked” consumers into signing up for these memberships that charged them hidden fees photo james f mccann founder of flowerscom and owner of a mets minority share credit nati harnikassociated press there were also senate investigative reports issued in november  and may  that prominently cited flowerscom for its aggressive online sales tactics saying the long islandbased flower firm had been paid more than  million for allowing others to engage in what the report described as “posttransaction marketing”a spokesman for mccann and flowerscom would not comment for this article but said in an email that the matters raised “are more than two years old have been largely resolved and have been previously disclosed in our company’s public filings” last month flowerscom inc said in a regulatory filing that it intended to defend itself vigorously in each of the outstanding lawsuitsbut in a  settlement with the new york attorney general the company paid  and promised to end practices cuomo’s office had called “fraudulent” at least as they related to the company’s new york customers the company neither admitted nor disputed claims of wrongdoing as part of the settlement advertisement continue reading the main story the settlement noted that flowerscom had since removed the solicitation and membership club enrollment link from its order confirmation pagea spokesman for wilpon and katz and the mets declined to comment on mccann’s legal entanglementsin  when bernard l madoff was arrested and his multibilliondollar ponzi scheme collapsed wilpon and katz as longtime madoff clients with investments of hundreds of millions of dollars had their financial empire upended things got worse when late in  the courtappointed trustee representing madoff’s victims sued wilpon and katz for  billion saying they had enriched themselves for years while ignoring warnings that madoff was up to no goodwilpon and katz as a consequence went in search of cash the men needed to repay some of their debt and deal with operating losses that rose to  million in  the men ultimately decided to raise  million by selling  to  shares in the club each representing a  percent ownership stake eventually  were sold but only a small number went to true outsidersone of those outsiders is steven a cohen the head of sac capital advisors a  billion hedge fund at the focus of an intensifying government investigation into insider trading cohen has not been accused of wrongdoing and may never be but last month federal prosecutors charged a former portfolio manager with a  million insider trading scheme that for the first time connected cohen to some questionable trades prosecutors have called the most recent case against an associate of cohen’s the most lucrative insider trading case in historymccann while technically an outside investor is an old friend of wilpon’s mccann has long been part of a group that every season visits spring training at port st lucie flain june mccann told the new york post that he along with some partners had bought a piece of the mets mccann said it was “a reasonable investment but growing up a lifelong mets fan this was more about being able to do something fun and interesting for me and my family” building a business mccann’s ability to afford even a modest stake in a major league baseball franchise demonstrates how far he has come in amassing a fortune in the flower business photo senator jay rockefeller led an inquiry into flowercoms practices credit j scott applewhiteassociated press from rockaway queens mccann  studied psychology at john jay college of criminal justice in new york and then became a social worker for  years at the st john’s home for boys in queens for extra money he also tended bar advertisement continue reading the main story mccann told the new york times as part of a  profile that a regular customer he called “scotch and soda” mentioned plans to sell his flower shop in  mccann borrowed  to buy that shop in manhattan making it the first in his eventual floral empire later he bought the flowers phone number and flowerscom web site before taking the company public for  a share in  in an initial public offering handled by goldman sachsnow flowerscom reports annual revenue of over  million and employs  people despite recent setbacks in a tough economy and as its stock now sits around  a share mccann received a compensation package including cash and stock worth  million for fiscal  mccann’s brother christopher the company’s president and chief operating officer got a package worth  milliontogether the two mccanns have been awarded  million in compensation over the last five years according to regulatory filings“if you look at highly successful people they make the same number of mistakes as others but they recover quickly” mccann told the times in  “they don’t sit around moaning about what they’ve done wrong”mccann added at the time that his biggest pet peeve was “unempathetic customer service reps”however records and interviews show that as early as  mccann’s company was deeply involved in what congressional investigators and new york regulators would come to regard as a vast swindle one aimed directly at the company’s customersin  senator jay rockefeller democrat of west virginia and chairman of the senate commerce committee was concerned enough about suspect online schemes that he began investigating the conduct of a number of retail companies including flowerscom

publiccustomers shop on the internet for a product — maybe movie tickets pizza or flowers once they find what they want they type in their contact information and credit card number and click “purchase” as they go through the checkout process rockefeller explained an ad from a thirdparty business tries to trick them into paying to sign up for “useless” membership clubs by offering cashback rebates or discounts if the customer is lured in amid the confusion rockefeller explained the consumer’s consent is taken as a given and the thirdparty business already has the credit card number the consumer entered for the initial purchase“most consumers don’t realize they have been scammed until months later when they notice that the club has been charging their credit card  a month” rockefeller said in a  statement according to the rockefeller investigation flowerscom was a significant player in the illegitimate game the company rockefeller charged was one of  online merchants that were paid more than  million apiece by thirdparty membership club businesses in exchange for exposing their customers to the schemean aide on the commerce committee which conducted the investigation for rockefeller said that for merchants like flowerscom the scheme was easy money nearly all profit and damaged their own customers the aide who was not authorized to speak publicly said the enterprise between the merchants and membership club marketers was successful because flowerscom and other retailers were willing to use the brand loyalty and trust they had built up with consumers against them the customers the aide said had confidence that the merchant would not be involved in something like this photo it is unclear if the mets owners saul katz left and fred wilpon knew that flowerscom had been accused of scamming customers credit kathy kmonicekassociated press the rockefeller report included the story of a massachusetts hospital executive named david murray who in february  realized he had been enrolled in a membership club called livewell after a purchase on flowerscom several months earlier advertisement continue reading the main story “do you really think what you did was morally right” murray wrote in an email to flowerscom “this is not true and is deceitful”murray went on to ask “is this really something flowers wanted to be associated with” concerns over practices rockefeller’s investigation turned up evidence that ever greater numbers of customers were catching on and that at least some people within flowerscom were growing worried — both about the propriety of the practice and the objections from the public“as you know” a company employee wrote in an internal email included in the report “for every one who complains vociferously there are dozens even hundreds that do not”any concerns though seemed tempered by what the email also noted was the lucrative nature of the arrangementthe backlash from consumers moved the employee to try to raise a meaningful alarm “if we don’t take steps to rectify this” she wrote of the questionable practice “i fear it will continue to have a huge negative impact on the customer experience” she continued “so i need to raise a major red flag here”meanwhile flowerscom was pitching its products to mets fansin june  flowerscom advertised on its facebook page that it was “teaming up” with the mets to celebrate birthdays inviting fans to sign up on a special mets page on its web site for a chance to have their name displayed on citi field’s giant video board advertisement continue reading the main story a month earlier in may  a “happy mother’s day” message from flowerscom appeared on the video board at citi fieldrockefeller and his committee issued their initial report in november  and mccann’s company soon announced that it would end its participation in the practices flagged by the committee photo ideas for arrangements inspired by teams including the mets are pictured on flowerscom credit flowers in a news release announcing the change mccann said “flowerscom has a legacy of product innovation and excellent customer service and everything we do is designed to provide our customers with the greatest value and the most convenience for the special occasions in their lives”in new york the attorney general’s inquiry into the matter led to settlements with the thirdparty businesses and many of the online retailers that had signed on with them as partnersin december  the attorney general’s bureau of consumer frauds and protection reached a settlement with flowerscom ending the threat of regulatory action in its findings against flowerscom the attorney general’s office said the company participated in a scheme that caused many consumers to be “enrolled in a membership program without their understanding or a conscious intent to be enrolled”the attorney general found that flowerscom’s practices violated state laws prohibiting repeated fraudulence in the course of business and deceptive acts or practices and false advertising in the conduct of any businessthe company paid the  settlement and the money was to be used for consumer education redress and the costs and fees of the investigationby the end of  president obama signed a law restricting the ability of online retailers to transfer sensitive billing information to third parties the law also required the thirdparty firms to clearly disclose the terms of their online offers and obtain billing information directly from consumers before assuming consent advertisement continue reading the main story still those who feel they were swindled remain angry lawyers for flowerscom had pressed unsuccessfully to have some of the complaints of the customer in the  lawsuit decided in arbitration now that suit filed in new york is being combined with cases filed in connecticut in  lawyers plan to try to build a classaction racketeering case against flowerscom the other web retailers credit card companies and the thirdparty companiesin arguing that flowerscom should be dismissed from the connecticut cases lawyers for the company said in an april filing that the plaintiffs had not shown that it had “actively participated” in a racketeering enterprise and that none of the plaintiffs had specifically accused it of enrolling them in a membership program by making a purchase at flowerscomin its latest quarterly filing to investors flowerscom said there were “no assurances” that additional legal actions related to its former business practices would not be brought“legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which may be beyond our control” the company wrote what that could mean to fred wilpon and the mets is largely unclear the mets’ minority investors like mccann were vetted as part of the process of being brought on board candidates seeking a slice of a major league team must also fill out lengthy applications dealing with their personal and financial backgrounds as they are examined for approval by the commissioner’s office those inquiries include disclosing current or past legal issuesbut mets fans — who have endured repeated losing seasons wrenching collapses at the end of oncepromising seasons and a front office that has spent much of the last two years reducing the team’s
