envirostar inc nysemktevi  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»envirostar and the lollapalooza effectnov   about envirostar inc evi jie min toh long only deep value contrarian microcapsummaryevi is going to change drastically as new ceo henry nahmad begins his rollup of the dry cleaning equipment distributing industry the current state of the dry cleaning equipment distributing industry and nahmad’s background support his rollup evi stands a good chance to increase market share in a usd billion industry jettison the qs the ks forget everything you know about envirostar nysemktevi the future will be nothing like the past a new ceocumowner is in town and he brings a radically new strategy to the sleepy company untested and inexperienced theres no certainty this strategy of his will succeed but several factors are certainly in his favor this article will evaluate the factors that determine his success understanding the acquisition of envirostar on march th  an unknown investment firm symmetric capital llc purchased a  stake in envirostar the investment firms sole controller was a young  year old by the name of henry nahmad who was he and why would he takeover and manage a microcap dry cleaning company a little family history on the nahmads is due in  albert nahmad acquired a sleepy holdings company by the name of watsco nysewso for under us million in the late s albert began focusing on acquisitions in the heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration hvacr industry back then the hvacr industry was highly fragmented and in alberts own words theres no one out there consolidating in the industry except us slowly but steadily albert executed a buyandbuild strategy acquiring  of gemaire distributors for us million in   of heating  cooling supply inc in  for us million and many more the success of albert nahmad is clear watsco has a current market cap of us billion and is the industry leader albert nahmad is also the uncle of henry nahmad our current ceo of envirostar henrys cousin ie alberts son sits on the board of watsco along with his father the pieces of the puzzle start to fall in place with a little speculation to fill the pieces stuart wagner a former member of both envirostar and watscos boards may have connected henry to the steiners the former owners of envirostar as henry tries to follow in the footsteps of his uncle what we do know for sure is that in a similarly highlyfragmented cleaning equipment distribution industry henry nahmad intends to acquire and build an industry leader just as his uncle did with hvacr and watsco in the history section of their webpage envirostar proudly states that together henry m nahmad and michael s steiner executive vice president of the company are spearheading envirostars efforts to build a market leader through the execution of its buyandbuild strategy a quick introduction of the buyandbuild ie the rollup what is a rollup what does it offer to envirostar if it succeeds a rollup involves the consolidation of a large number of small companies in the same industry to create a market leader such industries tend to be highly fragmented the reason for such consolidation includes costs savings from reaping economies of scales and increasing revenue from an increase in market power apart from watsco some other examples include sysco corporation nyse syy in the food distribution industry and quest diagnostics nyse dgx in the clinical laboratory industry understanding the current state of envirostar envirostar operates two fully owned subsidiaries in slightly different market segments these two business units comprise the entirety of its sales first theres steineratlantic a laundrydry cleaningboiler equipment distribution business next we have dryclean usa which franchises and licenses dry cleaning stores though dryclean usa is arguably the more recognized of the two given its  stores internationally its revenue and profits are insignificant compared to steineratlantics from envirostars latest k dryclean usas franchising fees account for a paltry  of total revenues and  of profits in  the spike in  was from a oneoff sale of a master franchise in mexico it must hence be clarified that the market segment envirostar intends to begin its rollup in is in equipment distribution in the bb space rather than the bc of dry cleaning stores this is the same space that watsco succeeded in its acquisition strategy with hvacr envirostars competitors are not your familiar names like comet cleaners or lapels dry cleaning factors that govern success of rollup envirostar has yet to acquire any distributor since nahmads takeover despite the lack of data points in this regard there are factors that we can use to evaluate the success of envirostars strategy nahmads background first and most salient henry nahmads background certainly contributes to envirostars eventual success nahmad not just his family has had his fair share of experience with the buyandbuild strategy prior to his acquisition of envirostar he was watscos director of corporate development and executed and integrated multiple acquisitions of hvacr distributors ranging in size from mm to mm in enterprise value nahmad has had fair experience with management as well before envirostar he was ceo of chemstar corporation a company that specialized in food compliance with nahmads  stake in envirostar his incentives are clearly aligned with the company doing well nahmad may well prove to be a competent and committed ceo of course it would be foolish to depict nahmad as some sort of miracle worker it is undeniable he has zero experience with the dry cleaning industry this will inhibit successful integration of acquired companies however his inexperience in the industry is mitigated in part by the rest of management and the board michael steiner the current coo was the founder of steineratlantic and is a veteran in the industry he still retains an  stake in envirostar after the sale similarly experienced is current cfo venerando indelicato who has served in this position since  in the latest defa it is stated that mr michael steiner and mr robert steiner are … to vote all shares of the companys common stock owned by them at any time during the term of the stockholders agreement as directed by mr nahmad in other words nahmads  stake in the company effectively translates to  voting power despite talk of partnership with the steiners let there be no doubt that it is nahmad who holds the final say in the company i think this is key for nahmad to bring about a thorough strategic change in the company the state of the industry from envirostars latest k the commercial and industrial laundry drycleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented with over  fullline or partialline equipment distributors in the united states the companys management believes that no one distributor has a major share of the market substantially all distributors are independently owned and with the exception of several regional distributors distributors operate primarily in local markets as mentioned above such a highly fragmented industry is where a rollup typically occurs in order to analyze whether a consolidation play in this industry will be profitable i will employ the cs framework as detailed in the paper the cs a modern framework for consolidation of fragmented industries a set of five criteria are used in this process all of which seem to suggest the industry is suitable for consolidation they are capital access restricted cultures and regions compatible customers and competitors receptive change catalysts unlikely competitive advantage realizable for the consolidator  ceteris paribus a bigger company can receive cheaper capital than a smaller one simply because it is deemed more creditworthy with its larger amount of assets however the significance of cost of capital varies from industry to industry i would argue that it is extremely significant in the dry cleaning equipment distribution industry given how expensive the equipment is with prices ranging up to the hundreds of thousands per equipment a significant amount of capital is certainly needed for purchasing from manufacturers lower cost of capital in turn leads to higher profit margins  are distributors willing to sell their shares and lose some of their autonomy there is too little information available to conclusively answer this question however management of the existing regional distributors is generally pretty old and may be looking for an opportunity to cash out just as the steiners did with envirostar  due to the infrequent need for purchasing dry cleaning equipment customers have less of an inclination to frequent the same distributor because of the lack of interaction between customer and distributor the transaction becomes impersonal and highly based on costs as such it is unlikely the customer will have any negative perception of a consolidation so as long as their costs remain the same  there are unlikely to be any change catalysts affecting the industry the bc industry is getting disrupted by a slew of tech startups but the need for dry cleaning equipment remains the amount of clothes that need to be dry cleaned is unlikely to diminish as well manufacturers tend to use dry clean only labels as a cover all to protect themselves  there exist economies of scale upon consolidation distributors can have a central distribution point purchase specialist capital equipment and so forth the actual reaping of economies of scale will come from the integration of acquired companies so not much can be said here yet understanding the risks of the investment the state of the economy a recession may well bring envirostar down as with most acquisitive strategies the cost of capital will increase if stock is used to fund acquisitions the company needs to keep stock price up which is difficult in a market decline alternatively if acquisitions are funded by debt a decline in cash flow may lead to inability in meeting payments this is exacerbated by the nature of dry cleaning equipment being bigticket items in times of recession customers may hold back on replacing their existing equipment leading to sharp drop in profits a recession would likely lead to me exiting my position nahmad fails in executing the buyandbuild if nahmad fails to properly execute the buyandbuild for instance overpaying for acquisitions or is unable to reap economies of scale from integrating the company envirostar will fail there are many rollups that have suffered this fate though none from this particular industry and some of these have even gone bust i will be closely monitoring the stock and exiting if there are any signs of this nahmad doesnt execute the buyandbuild no known timeline has been given yet regarding its execution for all we know the actual execution may only be years in the future envirostar is not a shortterm play the market is already factoring in high growth with the stock having a pe of  even though earnings have been stagnant for the last  years the stock price wil fall if this occurs having said this the fundamental business of envirostar is extremely solid and the profits have been stable the company is in a very healthy financial position with over usd million in cash and zero debt envirostar has a relatively low down side given this concluding put a sleepy forgotten product an ambitious young ceo and an industry with much to gain for consolidation together and you might just have the ingredients necessary for explosive growth this has led me to open a small position in envirostar the dry cleaning market is worth usd billion and envirostar is poised to capture an increasing amount of it i will be closely monitoring envirostar and provide a more detailed valuation as the rollup begins disclosure i amwe are long evi i wrote
