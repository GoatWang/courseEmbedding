homeland defense systems inc title chief executive officer company spider investments title managing member edward k defeudiss experience title chief executive officer company homeland defense systems inc job details homeland defense systems inc has been created to manage the us consumers needs to personally combat  or have the ability to combat the very credible threat of bioterrorism as the war on terrorism progresses new threats and fears may emerge and continue to disrupt our lives homeland defense systems inc has established an infrastructure that will serve the us consumer with products and services which fall under the homeland defense umbrella currently the us government is providing for all homeland defense concerns but as we become more engrossed in the war on terrorism there may be a need for new legislation which could open the market to private corporations consumers throughout the us are unsure of the governments ability to respond to a major national bioterrorist threat homeland defense systems inc believes this fear will eventually force the us government to allow private corporations to respond to the needs of the public we believe there will be many areas of growth in this market for addressing consumer products needs including water testing kits air testing kits food testing kits biological selfdiagnostic kits disaster kits medical kits gas masks etc we also believe that there will be many private testing facilities that will be licensed to handle the massive influx of new patient testing and analysis title managing member company spider investments

shortly disclosed the artist device  may include some or all of the same components as the avdd  shown in fig  and described aboveoverall purchase logic is shown in fig  commencing at block  a user purchase order of an audioonly portion of audio video av such as an av entity such as an av object is received eg by a server such as the server  implementing an audio purchasing service aps the user request may in part be generated by a user clicking on the abovementioned cpl in the description area of a web page of an av object at block  the audio only is extracted from the av object and provided to the user at block as discussed further below when clicking on a cpl on an av web page the user may be redirected by means of a network address link underlying the cpl to an audio purchase shopping cart web page hosted by the aps server as part of the redirection the av page address consumer computer address and the identification of the selected av file may be provided to the aps server via the shopping cart web page using the shopping cart web page a consumer can pay for the audio portion of the av file responsive to successful payment the aps server may accesses the av web page to in turn access the selected av object fetch the av object and extract the audio portion of the selected av file using a system tool such as “ffmpeg” using the consumer computer address received as divulged above the service downloads the audioonly file to the consumer computer at block  preferably the audio file is sent to the data partition identified by the consumer computer as the consumers media libraryfig  shows example artist computer logic for enabling an artist to arrange to have his audio tracks purchased from av web sites at block  the artist computer establishes an account with the aps server typically before establishing the account in some example nonlimiting embodiments the artist may first have uploaded one or more av objects to one or more av web sites such as but not limited to youtube at block  the artists adds an audio purchase link such as the cpl to one or more of his av objects on the av web sites details of example ways to do this are given belowmore specifically and now referring to fig  in one example implementation at block  the aps server receives from an artists computer account information including a global account identification of the artist used in av page internet sites as a nonlimiting example artists typically use gmail ids when uploading av files to youtube and this same id is provided by user input at the artist computer to the artists account with the aps serverusing that id the aps server can then access the artists various av files on av web sites such as youtube at block  the links to the av files are thereby obtained using one or more application programming interfaces apis commonly provided by the av web site and a ui presented at block  by the aps server to the artist computer allowing the artist to select one or more av titles as audioonly purchase candidates the artist selections of candidates are received at block  by the aps server and at block  the aps server navigates to the av web sites to add an audio purchase link such as the cpl to the description areas of the selected candidate av files again typically using apis provided by the av web sitefig  shows such as ui  that may be presented on a display of an artist computer the artist enters his global id in the field  and after accessing the av sites with that id to obtain the links to the artists av files as mentioned above in describing block  of fig  the various av files are listed at  the list may be by file name or title and by a newlypopulated network link or address for each file that is unique for the respective file and that will be associated with the cpl once the cpl is appended to the av file on the av web site these newlypopulated network links or addresses include network paths that point to the aps server and that indicate the identity such as the file name of the respective av object such as a fileas mentioned above with respect to block  in fig  the artist may select individual selectors  for each av file in the list to designate it as a candidate for audioonly purchase or the artist may select an “all” selector  to select all of the av files on the list as candidates as alluded to above with respect to block  in fig  the artist may then select an “apply” selector  which causes the aps server to access the av web sites and append or otherwise add an audio purchase link such as the cpl to the description areas of the artistselected candidate av fileshaving described how an artist can arrange to sell audioonly files from the av files he or she has uploaded to av web sites such as youtube attention is now drawn to figs  and  to explain details of an example purchase process using the audio purchase links on the av file pages at block  the aps server receives a message or other indication that a user has selected the belowdescribed “buy audio” selector referred to above as the audio purchase link such as a cpl on the web page of one of the artists av files it will readily be appreciated that since the audio purchase link is associated with the aps server the user computer in clicking the audio purchase link is redirected to the aps server and establishes communication with the aps server it will also be appreciated that since the audio purchase link was generated with an indication of the associated av object to which it was appended the aps server knows what av file equivalently what av web page hosting the file the user evinced a desire to purchase the audio fromat decision diamond  the aps server determines whether the audio from the av file identified in the redirect link is stored on an aps server data storage to do this it looks up by av file name the av files in its data storage and if the av file name is not found the aps server logic moves to block  to access the av file on the av web site from which the user computer was redirected at block  the audio portion of the av object is extracted and a copy is stored on the data storage of the aps server the video portion is not stored by the aps serverin extracting the audio only the aps server uses a tool such as a linux tool such as “ffmpeg” mentioned above to extract audioformatted data from an av object in an example audioformatted data can be identified by a file extension such as but not limited “aac” indicating that file is an audioformatted file after extraction the audio portion may be transcoded to for example mp formatin any case as consumers purchase the audioonly portions of av files each audioonly portion is stored by the aps service on its server furthermore as part of storing the audioonly files the aps service labels each audio file with a unique identifier which is some embodiments may include the address of the av page hosting the combined av file a unique subscript and the identification of the combined av file itself therefore for subsequent audio fileonly purchases the service can first search its own server storage by the identification of the combined av file associated with the desired audio file and if found on its own server download the audio file to the subsequent purchasing consumer the service thus need access combined av files and extract audio therefrom only for the initial purchase of any particular audio file eg only for the initial purchase of a song otherwise directly accessing the audio file eg song on its own storagefrom block  or from decision diamond  when it is determined that the requested audio already resides on the data storage of the aps server the logic moves to block  to provide to the user computer a purchase ui the purchase ui typically includes fields into which the user can enter credit card or other accounting information along with a delivery address either physical or more typically a user device network address if the purchase is not successfully completed at decision diamond  the logic may end at state  but otherwise the logic moves to block  to provide a download page to the user computer that the user can employ to select to download the purchased audio at decision diamond  selection to download results in the audio being streamed to the designated user computer address at block  with the audio being automatically sent to the user computer audio library typically under the direction of the operating system of the user computer and if desired automatically played on the user computer as well the entity affiliated with the aps server may be remunerated a percentage of the sales price of each purchased audiofig  shows an example ui  that may be presented on a user computer by an av web site such as youtube video may be presented in a video window  while accompanying audio is played on the speakers of the user computer an informational message  may indicate the artist name and av file title a “buy audio” selector  referred to above as an audio purchase selector or cpl may be selected by the user to initiate the logic of fig  starting at block figs  and  show alternate logic to set up the artists account on the audio purchase website note that in the logic of these figures the artist owning av files gives approval to the aps to share the av files of the artist and then the aps extracts the audio associated with the av files of the artist thus as described further below when an artist is shown the selection screen mentioned previously showing links to the artists av files on an av site and selects the audio from those av files he wants to sell the artists gives an authorization to share his av files with the aps which then stores only the audio files in its database the aps also pushes the audio purchase links to the av sites where fans of the artists can select to purchase the audio thus in the embodiments below it is not the purchaser fan causing the download and storage of the song on the aps but rather it is the artist causing the sharing and downloading of the song with the aps when the song resides in the aps database then it is available for purchase by the fans actionin fig  blocks  are analogous to blocks  in fig  with some differences noted below thus at block  the aps server receives from an artists computer account information including a global account identification of the artist used in av page internet sites as well as the network address of the artists personal computer on which the artists songs reside by eg artist input or if the artist is using the same computer to contact the aps by the network address that accompanies the artists contactusing the id the aps server can then access the artists various av files on av web sites such as youtube at block  the links to the av files are thereby obtained using one or more application programming interfaces apis commonly provided by the av web site and a ui presented at block  by the aps server to the artist computer allowing the artist to select one or more av titles as audioonly purchase candidates the artist selections of candidates are received by the aps serveronce the aps server has received the artist selections the aps server may present a query ui at block  to the artist computer seeking permission to obtain the audio files associated with the selected av files from the artists computer this may be done once for a global authorization or on a track by track basis for each selection by the artist that the artist has also authorized access on his personal computer to obtain the logic executes blocks  to access the artist computer on which the audio resides using the artist computer idnetwork address received at block with more specificity at block  a sample of the audio is obtained from the associated av object on the av website from which the links were obtained at block  this may be done by selecting the associated av object for play and recording a portion of the audio the portion may be eg a ten second clip of the audio or other fraction of the entire audio filemoving to block  the sample portion is used as entering argument in accessing the audio files on the artist computer which can be played by the aps server and compared against the sample portion to identify which audio file on the artist computer matches the portion an audio fingerprint engine such as “shazam” may be used for this comparison when a match is found at block  the entire matching song on the artist computer is copied by the aps server and stored in the aps server database and the aps server navigates to the av web sites to add an audio purchase link such as the cpl to the description areas of the selected candidate av files block  simply indicates that since the audio files are preloaded onto the aps server database tests at decision diamond  in fig  during subsequent buyer purchases from the av sites typically will return “yes” alternatively the test at decision diamond  in fig  may be omitted along with states  and  and the logic of fig  may instead proceed directly from block  to block  the audio files having already been obtained by the aps server in fig fig  shows alternate logic to set up the artists account on the audio purchase website blocks  are analogous to blocks  in fig  with some differences noted below thus at block  the aps server receives from an artists computer account information including a global account identification of the artist used in av page internet sitesusing the id the aps server can then access the artists various av files on av web sites such as youtube at block  the links to the av files are thereby obtained using one or more application programming interfaces apis commonly provided by the av web site and a ui presented at block  by the aps server to the artist computer allowing the artist to select one or more av titles as audioonly purchase candidates the artist selections of candidates are received by the aps serverin the embodiment shown in fig  the aps server may present to the artist computer a selector to indicate whether the artist accepts or not terms and conditions that may be delineated by the aps on the ui if the artist accepts a “move” selector an example of which is discussed further below in reference to fig  may be presented at block  for the artist to select to cause the aps to in response at block  receive the selection and in response to that move to block  to access the selected av files from the av websites at block  the audio is extracted from the av objects as described previously and stored on the aps database incidentally meaning that tests during subsequent purchases at decision diamond  of fig  typically will result in “yes” alternatively the test at decision diamond  in fig  may be omitted along with states  and  and the logic of fig  may instead proceed directly from block  to block  the audio files having already been obtained by the aps server in fig if desired the aps may present a ui at block  such as the ui shown in fig  informing the artist that the artist has successfully caused his audio content to by stored on a database of the aps service an “ok” selector may be provided in some examples responsive to the artist acknowledging the message or immediately with the message if no “ok” selector is presented a “monetize” or “sell” selector may be presented at block  which if selected by the artist and received at block  causes the aps to add the audio purchase links to the av sites as described previously so that fans of the artist can purchase the audiofig  shows an artist selection ui similar to the ui shown in fig  but with the abovedescribed “move” selector  which must be selected to precipitate copying the audio files from the av sites note that the move selector  may not be enabled until the artist selects a “yes” selector  indicating acceptance of terms and conditionsfig  shows a ui  that may be presented once the audio files have been successfully moved from the av sites to the aps with a “successful move” message  to cause the aps to populate the av sites with the audio purchase links as described above a monetize selector  may be presented which can be selected by the artist to precipitate the logic at block  of fig while the particular audioonly file provisioning from internet video is herein shown and described in detail it is to be understood that the subject matter which is encompassed by the
