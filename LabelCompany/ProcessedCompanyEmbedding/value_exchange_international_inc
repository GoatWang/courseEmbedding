corporate action  advisory nonbinding vote to approve executive compensation the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  allows our stockholders to vote to approve on an advisory and nonbinding basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this information statement and other filings with the securities and exchange commission or sec or commission and in accordance with the secs rules specifically section aa of the exchange act requires the company to seek i a nonbinding advisory shareholder vote commonly referred to as sayonpay vote on its executive compensation program as it is described below in the executive compensation section of this information statement and ii a nonbinding advisory shareholder vote on whether the sayonpay vote should occur every one two or three years  the board of directors recommended a threeyear frequency to its stockholders our executive compensation is designed to attract motivate and retain our named executive officers who are critical to our success our named executive officers are rewarded by salary for the achievement of specific annual longterm and strategic goals business unit goals corporate goals and the realization of increased stockholder value   while cash compensation in the form of base salary is the primary component of our compensation program as of the date of this information statement the company will evaluate the adoption of a comprehensive stock option and incentive plan from time to time and will consider adoption of such a plan when the company has reached a level of business and financial performance where appreciation in the public market price of the common stock based on the performance of the company and its management is deemed to be possible the company does not anticipate considering additional forms of compensation including incentive compensation until  our board of directors reviews the compensation for our named executive officers to ensure such compensation achieves the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our stockholders interests and current market practices stockholder approval is for our named executive officer compensation as described in the compensation section and related compensation tables below this vote commonly known as a sayonpay proposal gives our equity holders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers compensation this vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy policies and practices described in this information statement the company has not created a compensation committee of the board of directors as of the date of this information statement the board of directors intends to address creation of such a committee prior to the end of  the sayonpay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the company or our board of directors our board or directors values the opinions of stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the approval the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this information statement they will consider our stockholders concerns and the board of directors will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns corporate action advisory nonbinding vote on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation as part of our board of directors commitment to improved corporate governance and as required by section aa of the exchange act the board of directors provided stockholders with an opportunity to provide an advisory vote to determine whether the shareholder vote on named executive officer compensation or the sayonpay vote should occur every one two or three years after careful consideration the board of directors determined that a sayonpay vote that occurs every third year is the most appropriate alternative for our company as a small reporting company with a limited compensation program  therefore our board of directors recommended a frequency of every three years on holding future sayonpay votes in reaching its recommendation and since the compensation of the management has not significantly changed over the past few years the board of directors believes that every three years sayonpay vote will allow stockholders to provide stockholders with sufficiently meaningful input on our executive compensation philosophy policies and programs especially in light of the limited number of stockholders and the limited turnover in our stockholder base the options presented for stockholders approval were one year two years or three years for frequency of vote on sayonpay the threeyear frequency was approved by sufficient written consents of stockholders received as of august    corporate action amend articles of incorporation to change corporate name stockholders should not destroy any stock certificates and should not submit any stock certificates until requested to do so approval   our board of directors approved a resolution at the august   board meeting to change our corporate name from sino payments inc to value exchange international inc our board of directors believes that the new corporate name will more accurately reflect our current business activities in the area of information technology and computer software and systems development and will conform the company name to a name that is similar to its operating subsidiaries corporate names being value exchange international the board of directors believes that a common corporate name will allow more efficient and consistent promotion and marketing of the companys services and products and will enhance marketplace recognition of our company and its various services and products offered by the operating subsidiaries effectiveness of the name change and trading symbol   for state law purposes the change in our corporate name will become effective upon the filing of an amendment to the articles of incorporation with the secretary of state of nevada amendment we intend to file the amendment as soon as practicable after the filing of this information statement with the commission the name change also requires that we will also will file a submission to financial industry regulatory authority inc finra for the change of name and in order to receive a new stock trading symbol for our common stock  the request for a new trading symbol is voluntary and sought by the company to have a trading symbol that is similar to its new corporate name  while finra is not obligated to grant a request by our company for a specific trading symbol the company will seek approval of veii as the new trading symbol for our common stock finra approval which is not a certainty will take an estimated two to four weeks  finra may select the new trading symbol and is not obligated to approve our requested trading symbol the anticipated date of the filing of the finra application is september   the company anticipates that the change in corporate name and trading symbol will be effective on or before october   stockholder rights  changing the name of our company or trading symbol for our common stock will not effect the rights of existing stockholders  the proposed name change and proposed trading symbol change will not affect the validity or transferability of currently outstanding stock certificates of the common stock and stockholders will not be requested to surrender for exchange any stock certificates they hold stock certificates issued after the name change is effective will show the new corporate name companys stock transfer agent will charge its usual and customary fees for any stockholder transaction requiring or requesting issuance of new stock certificates showing the new corporate name exchange act registration  we will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act  our common stock is currently registered pursuant to section g of the exchange act and as a result we are subject to periodic reporting and other requirements  the corporate name change and change in trading symbol will not affect the registration of our common stock or reporting requirements pursuant to the exchange act accounting consequences  there will be no accounting consequences to our common stock upon the effect of our corporate name change and trading symbol change no going private transaction  the board of directors does not intend for the corporate name change or trading symbol change to be the first step in a series of plans or proposals of a going private transaction within the meaning of rule e as promulgated under the exchange act corporate action pursuit of proposed tsi stock acquisition on january   the company initiated efforts to reach an agreement to acquire  shares of the tsi capital stock for cash which tsi shares represent  of the issued and outstanding shares of tsi capital stock in order to acquire tsi as a whollyowned subsidiary and to expand company business into the philippines the companys operating subsidiaries provide as a service provider management and consulting services to tsi  the company believes that the provision of such services to tsi is made on an at arms length fair market basis as previously reported in filings with the commission the company deposited us with tsi in january  as a future subscription conditional deposit on the proposed purchase of the tsi stock and under an agreement in principle the deposit is refundable in full to the company if the proposed tsi stock acquisition is not consummated  as of the date of this information statement tsi and the company have not reached final mutually acceptable terms and conditions for or a signed definitive agreement for the proposed tsi stock acquisition and a condition to preceding with further efforts to consummate the proposed tsi stock acquisition being the approval of the psec of the transaction has not been obtained and the company is not certain of when psec will render a decision on this matter  the previously reported agreement in principle is not legally binding on tsi and the company as such there is no legally binding obligation to consummate the proposed tsi stock acquisition and although the company intends to continue efforts to close this transaction the proposed tsi stock acquisition may not occur  besides psec approval and reaching final terms for and signing a definitive mutually acceptable agreement the proposed tsi stock acquisition will also require the approval of companys board of directors and tsis board of directors of any agreement for the proposed tsi stock acquisition as well as application of the us deposit towards the purchase price of the tsi stock  company stockholder approval of the transaction is not required under nevada law the board of directors approved the continued effort to consummate the proposed tsi stock acquisition at the august   board meeting and sought stockholder ratification of the pursuit of the proposed tsi stock acquisition because of  the delay in seeking closure of the transaction and  to ascertain the stockholders support for a companys intention to expand its business and companys geographical market reach by acquisitions like the proposed tsi stock acquisition and b stockholders support for the continued effort to close the proposed tsi stock acquisition the delay in seeking closure of this transaction is the result of a combination of circumstances including changes in company management company managements attention being diverted to filing stabilizing and enhancing the business and financial condition of the company and its compliance with filing requirements under the exchange act and the pending psec review of the proposed tsi stock acquisition there can be no assurance that the company and tsi will reach agreement on and consummate the proposed tsi stock acquisition stockholders approved the continued pursuit of the proposed tsi stock acquisition by written consents received by august   and representing  shares of common stock or  of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock eligible to vote on this corporate action based on  shares of common stock being issued and outstanding as of the record date tsis business line in the philippines is substantially the same as the companys business line as performed by the companys operating subsidiaries which business line is the provision of computer hardware software devices sales terminals and other equipment collectively the products made by third parties and mostly used in the retail or ecommerce business and to own lease sell design install integrate maintain repair manage or otherwise commercially exploit the products or otherwise provide related information technology or
