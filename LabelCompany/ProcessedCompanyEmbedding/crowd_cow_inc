hooves says crowd cow cofounder joe heitzeberg but i’ve been asked for hooves”founded in  the startup works with a dozen independent ranchers to help sell their cattle directly to consumers historically traditional cattle ranchers have sold their beef through public auctions small butchers or specialty restaurants crowd cow changes up the model by connecting the rancher more directly with the consumeronce the startup purchases a cow it takes on the marketing packaging and shipping on behalf of the farmer the key to ensuring this doesn’t become a logistical headache technology“it’s

also nice that they give you no limits on disk space or transfers initial set up was very easy as well low start up cost makes this a good value for the money if you are just starting out website set up is almost instant so you can get started right away on site building there are many positives to this hosting service what do you dislikeunfortunately i have found that they are very slow to run wordpress sites which is what i normally use other hosting companies can run them much better and a lot faster i also found customer service to be lacking i had issue with one of my wordpress sites and found that they had shut them all down it was a simple issue to fix yet i spend hours and hours one the phone with a service rep my sites were down for almost a whole day which in the world of online retail is entirely too long recommendations to others considering the producti would be careful if you are using wordpress sites and if you are setting up more than one site get one up and running first and make sure the speed is up to par with what you need you dont want to find yourself having to redo more than one siteread moreshare on of  found this helpfulhelpfulyesno commentsadd a

reliable with a decent feature set but needs to be more competitively priced overallupdated on june  validated reviewwhat do you like bestthe uptime that fatcow can boast is absolutely amazing i never once personally experienced the server that our site was on being down or having issues that prevented access to our company site or custom domain email this was essential in our initial reasoning behind choosing fatcow downtime equals lost sales missed customers and missed opportunitieswhat do you dislikethe price the price is low at first and is touted as being a cheap and economical host once the trial period runs out though the price jumps up and loses this factor the price after the trial period when compared to the services you get is easily outdone by other major hosting providers the features at the new price point felt lacking and the support to help with the existing features was delayed and lackluster although it did exist and the actual support representatives themselves were very friendlyrecommendations to others considering the productfatcow is great for an initial startup period to get your domain registered and get a website going once the trial cost period ends or if you need more advanced features with quickefficient support then it may be time to look at other hosting options unless fatcow starts relying more on competitive pricingfeatures and less on rank optimization and affiliate marketing for growing their customer basewhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedi utilized fatcow for the domain and web hosting services they provided my startup at the time needed marketing visibility and consumer trust to be successful  and those can all be provided with a solid custom domain to match your company name a reliable company site to promote visibility and the primary web presence to generate your leads to i was satisfied with the services until i decided i wanted a new domain and looked closer at their services and out of trial period costs at which point i realized their were alternatives that were more economical and feature rich  while maintaining a satisfactory enough uptime ratio they still have their niche in the hosting world and as for uptime  cant be beat in my opinion so i always keep a look out for promotions and changes in their pricing structureread moreshare on of  found

has diminished over the yearsupdated on april  validated reviewwhat do you like bestfatcow is a hosting provider and gets the job done if you need to buy a domain and host your website it is a quick solution for anyone who wants something minimal and something live quickly since fatcow is a pretty wellknown hosting provider they try their best to offer the best service to their customerswhat do you dislikehaving been a fatcow customer for a long period of time it feels like the customer service at fatcow has diminished over the years i have had a website hosted on fatcow for about  years before i decided to make the move to a better provider in my opinion and never needed much assistance with anything  as most of the documentation was fairly easy to understand however when i did need some technical customer service support there were a few things that were red alarms   their response time was pretty slow  hours  unapologetic  the tone of the representatives i spoke with was rude and harsh  the pricing actually almost doubled in the last  years of my service with them it is disappointing to know that being a longtime customer i was not given a good customer service experience when i needed itrecommendations to others considering the producti recommend hiring or at least training your customer service representatives to have more soft skills for interacting with their customers it is crucial to any business to hire the best people  as those people who talk to your clients are the face of your companywhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedi am a web developer looking for a place to host my own website and any client websites that i need to for my freelance job the benefits i have realized for fatcow is that it is easy to set up and get a website up and running within a few hours this is beneficial to anyone in a time crunch or is looking to meet a deadline for a client without having to go through loopholes

have a number of webdomains at fatcow and they have been pretty good it does cost more each year but not as bad as some of the other i would recommend this if you are doing wordpress onlywhat do you dislikethere are times they take things down for maintenance sometimes they get viruses some extra features that you want are extra money and they dont do backups for free make sure you keep your own backups as either you pay a lot for backups or they dont do them they also can block your contact if it gets a virus probably from shared area or wordpress flawrecommendations to others considering the producttry it out for noncritical hosting like your own blog or personal site look for discounts and search from different browsers link from different browsers different times of day as different people will get different prices and different promo codes try it for yourself for a small site with the cheapest one month value and then decide dont get a full year unless you can get it for  a

went to an upscale grocery store to pick up some steaks and found himself wondering where the meat was from and why it cost so much in talking to his friend joe they discovered that many of their friends had purchased beef directly from local farms and had bragged about how great the meat was but the trouble of finding a good ranch coordinating payment and pickup and the idea of having to purchase and store up to a years worth of beef at once was too much there had to be a better way ethan suggested they “crowdfund a cow” so that  people could each buy a tiny amount of beef directly from a local farm after a couple of weekends visiting ranches and building a website crowd cow was launched and the first cow was sold in  hours mission crowd cow’s mission is to allow everyone to

consumers its not just customers that are benefitting crowd cow also empowers their farmers by removing any flash or superfluous branding from what consumers receive in the mail so the focus is squarely on the product as scott meyers a lopez island farmer who uses crowd cow to sell the wagyu beef that he produces on his washington ranch says “they’re transparent — they sell our product as our product” crowd cow currently delivers overnight to the west coast and southwest but as demand increases the company plans to expand to the east coast as well although crowd cow isn’t the first
