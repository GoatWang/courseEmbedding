herehome vendor to watch repairtech inc hatched by entrepreneurial college students this it management software vendor makes an affordable entrylevel rmm solution for managed service newcomers by rich freeman tweet it’s only a little misleading to say that repairtech inc was brought into being by the lure of free pizza a more accurate telling of the san jose califbased software maker’s story would begin when a teenager named ian alexander got a job fixing pcs he loved working with technology but hated running multiple diagnostic tools one after the other and dreamed of creating a solution that would combine and automate all those processes a few years later and in college alexander saw a flyer on campus promoting the kickoff meeting for a product invention contest with a  first prize there would be free pizza on hand so he went to the meeting submitted his computer repair automation idea rounded up some collaborators and created his dream solution and then won the contest repairtech inclocation san jose calif website repairtechsolutionscom description this it management software vendor makes an affordable entrylevel rmm solution for managed service newcomers roughly a year later in october  repairtech officially opened its doors alexander became its ceo and that contestwinning product went on sale under the name techsuite today repairtech offers a second solution named kabuto which originated as a local monitoring agent that technicians can install on the pcs they service if a virus strikes or hard drive begins failing the system alerts the owner and reminds them who to call for assistance “it puts their brand in front of a customer when they need it the most” alexander says over time repairtech added remote monitoring patch management and antivirus capabilities turning what began as a sort of leadgeneration tool into a lightweight rmm solution less configurable than betterknown offerings it’s also less expensive making it an attractive option for managed service newcomers “kabuto at its core is designed to be plugandplay” alexander says “you don’t have to spend six months getting trained on how to use it” the system integrates with related thirdparty products including mhelpdesk and pc repair tracker as well as autotask connectwise and a psa solution for computer breakfix specialists named repairshopr it’s gaining new capabilities all the time too backup functionality is coming soon for example with more to follow this year “we’re going to be adding tons of stuff that’s going to bring more feature parity” with the industry leaders says alexander who now heads a fastgrowing company with more than  customers “it’s been a fun journey” he says images tags vendor to watchrepairtech inctechsuitekabuto related features vendor to watch
