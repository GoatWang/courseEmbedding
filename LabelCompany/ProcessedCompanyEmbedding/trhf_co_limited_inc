were shareholders of trhf prior to the change of control event described in trhfs form k filed on june   wang bo the shareholders and their affiliates had no interaction with trhf other than the negotiation    on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding equity of hpil   on september   hpil entered into agreements with shenzhen tian rui hui feng agriculture co ltd formerly known as shenzhen branch innovation and technology company limited“sztrhf” its shareholders shenzhen city hai zhuo tian rui investment company limited and wang jing whereby the company through hpil controls

these series of contractual arrangements without transferring legal ownership in sztrhf as a result sztrhf became a variable interest entity “vie” and accordingly its financial position and results of

“prc” the sztrhf is in the business of design and distribution of close caption television and monitoring products for application in the agricultural sector the company is owned by shenzhen city hai

detailed above sztrhf has been accounted for a wholly owned subsidiary of the company   this current report contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this current report these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following           additional financing requirements   from time to time in order to expand operations to meet customer demand the company will need to incur additional capital expenditures these capital expenditures are intended to be funded from third party sources including the incurring of debt andor the sale of additional equity securities in addition to requiring additional financing to fund capital expenditures the company may require additional financing to fund working capital research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenditures and operating losses the incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of the company’s operations the sale of additional equity securities will be dilutive to the interests of current equity holders in addition there can be no assurance that such additional financing whether debt or equity will be available to the company or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms any inability to secure such additional financing on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business financial condition and operating results of the company   reliance on key personnel   our success depends to a large extent on the efforts of our key personnel including our executive directors senior management and key employees there is no assurance that these key personnel will not voluntarily terminate their employment with our group the loss of any of our key personnel could be detrimental to our ongoing operations our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in order to manage our existing operations as well as our future growth   business combinations   the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of other complementary businesses the company may also pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage its core products and industry experience to expand its product offerings and geographic presence the company has limited experience with respect to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to forming collaborations strategic alliances and joint ventures if the company were to make any acquisitions it may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities any future acquisitions the company makes could also result in large and immediate writeoffs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities any of which could harm the company’s operating results integrating an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of the company’s existing business   competition and market share   the chinese tea market in which the company operates could be considered as highly competitive and fragmented and the competition is expected to continually increase many of the company’s competitors sell products that are similar to the company’s products and the company’s ability to compete against them is significantly dependent on its ability to distinguish its products from those of its competitors and demonstrate product quality in addition consumer preferences and needs may change quickly and frequently creating opportunities for new competitors to enter the market and for existing competitors to take away the market share of the company   global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations   our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions which historically is cyclical in character the us has largely worked its way out of an economic recession while other key international economies continue to be impacted by a recession characterized by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit going concern threats to financial institutions major multinational companies and medium and small businesses poor liquidity declining asset values reduced corporate profitability extreme volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies in markets where our sales occur and which become depressed these conditions affect the rate of spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products and delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions all of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition in a weakened economy companies that have competing products may reduce prices which could also reduce our average selling prices and harm our operating results           risks related to our capital stock   the public market for our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in the recent past stocks specifically those traded on the overthe counter “otc” markets generally have experienced high levels of volatility our common stock is traded on the otc market under the symbol “trhf” and is not eligible for trading on any national or regional securities exchange or the nasdaq national market while that status is the company’s longer term objective a more active trading market for our common stock may never develop or if such a market develops it may not be sustained   in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business   the securities and exchange commission “sec” has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to specific exemptions the market price of our common stock is less than  per share and therefore is a “penny stock” and is subject to the “penny stock” rules of the sec the trading market in our securities is currently limited and relatively illiquid which status makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock brokers and dealers effecting transactions in “penny stock” must disclose certain information concerning the transaction obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities these rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to sell shares   we have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures   federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics the company has not adopted exchangemandated corporate governance measures and since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange we are not required to do so it is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct for example in the absence of audit nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions   we may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal control over financial reporting   as directed by section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  “sox ” the sec has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companys internal control over financial reporting in its annual reports while we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by sox  there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby at present there is no precedent available with which to measure compliance adequately in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing could suffer           the company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future   the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future the company instead intends to retain earnings if any to develop and expand its business   provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent takeover which may not be in the best interests of our shareholders   provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have antitakeover effects which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called and may delay defer or prevent a takeover attempt in addition certain provisions of the nevada revised statutes also may be deemed to have certain antitakeover effects which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporations disinterested stockholders   any investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk   investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described above and all other information in this form k and in any reports hereafter filed with the sec before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business the occurrence of any of the risks described in this form k could harm our business the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and investors may lose part or all of their investment   section   financial information   item  completion of acquisition or disposition of assets   as previously reported in form k filed on july

and cash equivalents trade receivables prepaid expenses payables and accrued expenses fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision we consider the carrying values of

accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided for using straightline methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets usually three to seven years   valuation of longlived assets   we periodically evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value a writedown would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value we do

in an accumulated deficit of  as of december   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business accordingly there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a

makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years these accounts and estimates include but are not limited to the estimation on useful lives of property plant and equipment actual results could differ from those estimates   c cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less as of december   cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in usd in hong kong   d accounting for impairment of longlived assets   the company adopts accounting standards codification “asc”  “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlive assets” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with asc  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets   the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets   if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell during the reporting periods there was no impairment loss   e general  administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses include audit fee and legal and professional fee     f     health plus international limited notes to financial statements as of and for

assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin ” included in the codification as asc  income taxes the topic addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under asc  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement asc  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures   g fair value of financial instruments   for certain of the company’s financial instruments including cash and equivalents accounts and other receivables accounts and other payables accrued liabilities and shortterm debt the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the company asc topic  “financial instruments” defines fair value and establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   the company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under asc  “distinguishing liabilities from equity” and asc    the companys financial instruments include cash and equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable cash and cash equivalents consist deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less management estimates the carrying amounts of the nonrelated party

transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards the guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic  revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and

impact on the company’s financial statements   in august  the fasb issued asu no  “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” “asu ” which requires

financial statement     f     health plus international limited notes to financial statements as of and for the period ended december     i contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed

    health plus international limited notes to financial statements as of and for sixmonth periods ended june   and december      b use of estimates   in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years these accounts and estimates include but are not limited to the estimation on useful lives of property plant and equipment actual results could differ from those estimates   c cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less as of june   cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in usd in hong kong   d accounting for impairment of longlived assets   the company adopts accounting standards codification “asc”  “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlive assets” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets to be held and used in accordance with asc  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts in that event a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the longlived assets   the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets   if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell

financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin ” included in the codification as asc  income taxes the topic addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under asc  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement asc  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures     g fair value of financial instruments   for certain of the company’s financial instruments including cash and equivalents accounts and other receivables accounts and other payables accrued liabilities and shortterm debt the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the company asc topic  “financial instruments” defines fair value and establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument   · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   the company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under asc  “distinguishing liabilities from equity” and asc    the companys financial instruments include cash and equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable cash and cash equivalents consist deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less management estimates the carrying amounts of the nonrelated party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their shortterm nature     f     health plus international limited notes to financial statements as of and for sixmonth periods ended june   and december     h recent accounting pronouncements   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “income statement— extraordinary and unusual items subtopic ”this update eliminates from gaap the concept of extraordinary items subtopic  income statement—extraordinary and unusual items required that an entity separately classify present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions presently an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item paragraph  contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification    unusual nature the underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity taking into account the environment in which the entity operates  infrequency of occurrence the underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future taking into account the environment in which the entity operates   if an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement net of tax after income from continuing operations the entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earningspershare data applicable to the extraordinary item   the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim

a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed   j unaudited interim financial information  these unaudited interim condensed financial
