donate share thisfacebooktwittergoogleredditpinterestlinkedinprintmoreemailtumblrpocket fire letter to president john l lahey by admin september   september   president john l lahey quinnipiac university  mount carmel avenue hamden connecticut  sent via us mail and facsimile  dear president lahey as you can see from our list of directors and board of advisors the foundation for individual rights in education fire unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders scholars journalists and public intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of liberty legal equality academic freedom due process freedom of speech freedom of conscience and as in this case freedom of association on america’s college campuses our website wwwthefireorg will give you a greater sense of our identity and activities fire is gravely concerned about the threat to freedom of speech and freedom of association presented by the content of a recent letter sent from a qunnipiac university qu administrator to jaclyn hirsch of qu’s chapter of the society of professional journalists this is our understanding of the facts please inform us if you believe we are in error over the course of the – academic year the quinnipiac chronicle qu’s student newspaper disagreed with the qu administration over various policies that restricted the activity and autonomy of the newspaper for instance qu mandated that the paper’s content could only be posted on the web simultaneously with the publishing of the print version and in may  qu asserted unprecedented control over the selection of the paper’s leaders ultimately a number of chronicle staff members and applicants for chronicle positions founded an independent online news publication the quad news early this academic year students in the quinnipiac university chapter of the society of professional journalists spj and student members of the quad news jointly participated in activities held on campus according to a quad news statement issued on september   the publication had reserved meeting space at qu for weekly meetings and the reservations had been approved on august   by esther deangelis secretary for the campus reservation and information center in response to the interactions between spj and the quad news on september   in a letter erroneously dated september  daniel w brown director of qu’s student center and student leadership development wrote to jaclyn hirsch who is both spj president and managing editor of the quad news brown’s letter stated that “any further interaction or endorsements with the quad news sic could result in the quinnipiac university chapter of the society of professional journalists losing its recognition status” while it is true that qu’s – student handbook states that independent organizations such as the quad news may not “operate on campus” brown’s letter goes so far as to ban spj’s “interaction” with such a group notwithstanding the strange circumstance of someone like hirsch not being allowed to “interact” with herself at any public university brown’s restriction would be a clear violation of the group’s first amendment right to freedom of association as the united states supreme court has held “it is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ‘liberty’ assured by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment which embraces freedom of speech” naacp v ala ex rel patterson  us    we recognize that qu is a private university that may choose to prize certain values higher than those of freedom of expression and freedom of association we are curious however what value brown is expressing when he bans interaction with an independent student newspaper that has been at odds with qu is brown promoting the value of squelching criticism of the university such a value would seem to betray the spirit of debate that should characterize a free marketplace of ideas and a university such as qu which advertises itself as a “spirited welcoming campus” how can students in the core curriculum course qu  learn about “the rights and responsibilities of citizenship” when the rights they enjoy as citizens off campus are abruptly eliminated when they step foot onto campus the supreme court famously observed that “the college classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas” healy v james  us    we would hope that qu would honor the special role of freedom of expression and association in a modern liberal education rather than seek to restrict and censor student interaction and initiative qu’s hostility towards a free and independent press borders on the bizarre the chronicle reported on december   that you had made the following statements at a student government association meeting the previous wednesday so i guess the challenge for us now is how in today’s world we can really have a good discussion with the students about important topics but not have it be a press conference to the world where i have absolutely no control why should i come to a meeting like this to discuss with the students sensitive topics such as diversity that are appropriate to discuss but run the risk of that being reported maybe accurately or not accurately in addition the september  memo from vice president for public affairs lynn bushnell which claims that a recent yale daily news editorial “abused” the “power of the press” by criticizing qu’s behavior in this situation only provides more evidence of an unhealthy preference among qu administrators for censorship and silence rather than free and open debate if quinnipiac university wishes to be a place where even the most fundamental american rights are subordinated to repressive university policies or the beliefs and preferences of university administrators the university should explicitly state as much in its policies and literature so that students faculty members and the public understand that qu places these values above those enshrined in the us constitution since qu has not done so however fire requests that you clarify to spj that its members may interact with outside groups in ways that do not violate qu policy with impunity doing so will go a long way toward restoring the good name and reputation of quinnipiac university fire hopes that this matter can be resolved amicably and swiftly with fairness and common sense we request a response by october   sincerely adam kissel director individual rights defense program cc mark thompson senior vice president for academic and student affairs manuel carreiro vice president and dean of students lynn bushnell vice president for public affairs

before quinnipiac university’s commencement in may  file photo — new haven register by ed stannard new haven register posted   pm est  updated on   comments quinnipiac university president john l lahey earned almost  million in  the secondhighest compensation of any private us university president according to the chronicle of higher education most of that income  million was the result of lahey’s becoming fully vested in his retirement plan after  years leading the growing university in hamden according to quinnipiac spokeswoman lynn bushnell his base pay was   more than in  the chronicle reported lahey’s  earnings as reported on internal revenue service form  were exceeded only by those of shirley ann jackson president of rensselaer polytechnic institute who earned  million the median pay was just under  for  current and former presidents reported the chronicle based in washington dc “in  after completing  years as president dr lahey became fully vested in his retirement plan” bushnell said in an emailed statement “in keeping with irs rules he was required to report the full amount and pay the full tax on a retirement plan that will be paid out over  or more years after his retirement the university has never deferred compensation for any of its executives including the president” advertisement the chronicle did not include deferred compensation in its totals but listed an additional  in deferred pay for lahey told of the chronicle’s figures bushnell maintained that quinnipiac does not award deferred compensation a request for an interview with lahey was denied “the university adheres to the highest standards of corporate governance in establishing executive compensation for all seniorlevel officers” bushnell wrote “compensation levels are set by the personnel committee of the board of trustees and are determined after reviewing compensation levels at comparable institutions an independent compensation firm validates the list of appropriate peer institutions the personnel committee sets salaries with an eye to attracting and retaining highly qualified and highly motivated executives based on an annual review of agreedupon goals” according to the chronicle lahey was paid  million more than the next highestpaid president of a similar university paul g gaffney ii of monmouth university in new jersey former yale president richard c levin earned more than  million in  the last year figures were available to place him th on the list the full list can be found at httpchroniclecomcompensation jack stripling senior reporter of the chronicle said lahey’s  earnings were a oneyear “anomalous payout” and not representative of his annual salary lahey’s total compensation in  was  million and his base pay has risen from  in  to ’s  formerly a vice president at marist college lahey has overseen a massive expansion at quinnipiac since he was named president in  the university has added schools of law medicine and social work and added campuses on york hill in hamden and in north haven to its original mount carmel campus while many universities have expanded over the last  years as have their executive salaries stripling said it’s unusual for one president to stay in office that long “i think longevity makes a difference he’s well outside of the norm in that regard” stripling said tuition at quinnipiac is  and lahey’s ratio of pay to tuition is “way out on the edge of the norm relative to this measure” stripling said it takes  students paying full tuition to pay lahey’s  compensation a ratio in the th percentile of university and college presidents lahey’s compensation is also high when compared with quinnipiac’s  million in expenses according to the chronicle however stripling said “in my experience compensation for college presidents can be a very significant symbolic issue but when looked at in the context of a college’s budget there’s not much evidence to suggest that  tuition rates are driven by the compensation of the college president” lahey’s base pay of  was  times that of full professors’ median salary of  ranking in the th percentile three other quinnipiac officials earned more than  in  according to the chronicle’s report patrick healy senior vice president for finance mark thompson senior vice president for academic and student affairs and donald weinbach vice president for

great hunger museum in hamden connecticut this fridaygale zucker the crisis moment in our collective history the year zero through which our past and our present must always travel is  now quinnipiac university in hamden connecticut is set to unveil the first great hunger museum which shows the history of that terrible erathrough art and artifacts the legacy of black  as it came to be called is still being felt in myriad of ways inirish society and culture and its shadow has played out in our history in ways that we are still only beginning to apprehend growing up in the bronx quinnipiac university president dr john lahey  first heard about the irish faminethe way most people still do in the united states – by word of mouth as a boy in the irish section of riverdale he was told that the irish had been lazy and foolish to have allowed themselves to become so dependent on one crop the potato what he didn’t know at the time was that this version of events was nonsense the truth was that there were plenty of crops and alternative food supplies in ireland during the famine and that it was the economic policies of the ruling british government of the period that led to the mass starvations when he was invited to become grand marshal of the st patrick’s day parade in new york city in  lahey took the opportunity to research the famine in detail what he discovered changed his life and his whole outlook on irish history “my awakening with respect to ireland’s great hunger came in  when i read christine kinealy’s this great calamity” he tells the irish voice “i grew up in riverdale my father’s father was born in ireland and left as a kid growing up i heard references to the potato famine as it was called back then but my family didn’t talk about it other than in vague ways as a dark period in ireland’s history” the famine was the reason why there were so many irish in america he discovered  but in his home it wasn’t spoken of at all “i had the sense that irish americans were embarrassed by it they had possibly internalized some guilt associated with it it was not until i read kinealy’s book that i began to engage” laheyrecalls “coincidentally around the same time i was approached by the st patrick’s day parade committee to be grand marshal in  that was also the th anniversary of the famine by that time the irish government andirish americanshere were finally starting to acknowledge the tragedy it’s causes and consequences and memorials were being commissioned and new historical studies were being released” the time was finally right so lahey set about researching the calamity what he discovered was that anglo irish historians had written the story of the great hunger in its immediate aftermath and they had decided where to pin the blame in the process they played down their own responsibility and vowed they’d done all they could to alleviate the suffering “well it turns out that the anglo irish quite consciously took advantage of the crisis to enact land reform and to tighten their grip on ireland the takeaway for me from christine’s book was that i had a greater sense of the consequences and the magnitude of what had happened in ireland” lahey says “this was an avoidable tragedy more than one million people didn’t have to die two million didn’t have to emigrate” what lahey discovered was that there had been a potato crop failure the irish were certainly dependent on the crop but the root causes of their dependency went further back to the cromwellian period and their forcible removal from land in the northeast in particular by  the irish population was cut in half by  they were cut in three quarters during the famine the british government never closed the ports or reduced the tariffs instead they shipped out food that could have saved the starving they used none of the resources of the then wealthiest nation on earth to come to ireland’s aid “when i was asked to be grand marshal i discovered that most of the previous ones had been born in ireland and had talked about their times there i guess it was the combination of the educator in me and the fact that i was second generation irish that i decided to make the theme of that year’s parade the great hunger” lahey recalls the easiest thing about being grand marshallahey says is leading the parade up fifth avenue the more challenging task was that every irish organization in new york from january  onward wanted him to come to their dinner dance all the way to march  “i attended about  or so to talk about the great hunger then for the first time ever at noon we stopped the parade for a minute’s silence to commemorate those lives impacted” lahey says the famine held back ireland for  years lahey says the country made little progress from the great hunger and the agrarian undeveloped country it was it missed almost the entire industrial revolution it really didn’t begin to emerge as a growing country with a growing economy until the s and ‘s with the electronic age “the effect on ireland was not just thegreat hunger years from  to  thereafter anyone with ambition and talent knew they had to leave to achieve their goals” lahey says “there was a psychological aspect to it too i think the irish internalized the experience many of them accepted the narrative the british government told them  they were lazy they reproduced too much they drank and they were irresponsible i had no idea of the true magnitude of the famine how it set back the country’s growth in all areas” with the new museum at quinnipiac his ambition is clear “i hope to educate people about the high quality of irish art i strongly think the irish haven’t been given their due in the field of the visual arts they have in theater literature and music but they also had some great artists in the th and th centuries” lahey feels principled truth tellers aren’t always welcomed with open arms anywhere especially if they have come to tell hard truths which the famine museum necessitates the irish have always known this and the british have always monitored our statements for centuries “when i was announced as grand marshal in december  the ambassador from london took a few shots at me saying that i was trying to rewrite history” laheyreveals “parade officials also had some discussions with me to ask if we really wanted the great hunger to be the theme of the parade since it was controversial but they got on board quickly” lahey had terrific support along the way he adds “the real vision and drive behind this museum i’m delighted to say comes from the son of jewish immigrants from poland” lahey reveals murray lender chairman of quinnipiac’s board of trustees who sadly passed away in march heard lahey give talks on the great hunger while he was grand marshal and told laheyhe wanted to give the university a gift to provide a special room in the library at quinnipiac dedicated to the great hunger “he told me ‘i grew up in new haven and i had a lot of irish friends and i never heard a word about the famine’ he was very forceful about saying it needed to be told and he underwrote it” the famine was an avoidable tragedy lahey concludes the potato crop failure was not the fault of the british government and there would have been some deaths from it but it didn’t have to become a great calamity the new museum will record that underline and commemorate it “a lot of irish and irish americanartists and supporters helped to make this day possible but without the support of a son of a jewish immigrant from poland who saw parallels in our experience we wouldn’t be there on friday to dedicate this new facility that’s a proof of how important this story is to all immigrants” laheysays   shares  comments most popular most recent politics

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
