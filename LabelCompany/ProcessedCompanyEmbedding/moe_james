and a cofounder of oligomerix “we’re using cdd vault as a way of storing our chemical structures as a way of searching them as a way of storing all of our assay data we’re also using it for doing calculations for analyzing our data for creating reports and communicating the data to others and then also very importantly for working securely with collaborators so it’s been instrumental for all of those purposes” james moe president ceo and a cofounder of oligomerix dr moe has  years industrial experience having held senior management positions in product development working on international teams in both early and late stage diagnostic biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies including genetrakamoco technology venturesvysis biomerieux and mosaic technologies prior to founding oligomerix he was director of product development at pyrosequencing senior molecular biologist at spire biomedical and director of product development at qrna inc dr moe received his phd degree in molecular biologymolecular biophysics from wesleyan university did his postdoctoral studies at vanderbilt university in the center for molecular toxicology where he was jointly appointed in the biochemistry department in the medical school and the chemistry department in the college of arts and sciences and has an mba degree with a concentration in entrepreneurial studies from boston university interviewed by shirley louisemay collaborative drug discovery inc i’m here with james moe president and ceo and a cofounder of oligomerix oligomerix is a small biotech company primarily interested in addressing tauopathies tau is a protein in the central nervous system cns that has been implicated in neurodegeneration if there are problems with the pathways downstream or upstream of tau james could you introduce us to the nature of oligomerix’s research sure i’m james moe president and ceo of oligomerix we’re a company that’s focused on tau as a therapeutic target of neurodegeneration for alzheimer’s disease ad but the work that we’re doing also applies to numerous other diseases in fact there’s about twenty different tauopathies that are known to date alzheimer’s disease ad is a dementia that is characterized by the pathological hallmarks plaques and tangles composed primarily of aggregated amyloid beta or tau protein respectively when we embarked on this project we chose to go after tau as a target based on the reproducible pattern of the development and spread of tau pathology during the course of ad and because it was a differentiated approach from most other programs that were targeting the amyloid pathway we also decided to further differentiate ourselves by targeting the oligomeric aggregates of tau rather than the larger and more inert fibril aggregates of tau now after having embarked on this path about eleven years ago or so most of the drug candidates developed against the amyloid target have failed in late stage clinical trials so increasingly there’s a lot of interest in tau as a target and we have a pretty decent head start there we’ve always believed that it’s an important target for ad so we’re trying to discover drugs that prevent tau from aggregating and developing its neurotoxic function   very nice now that you’ve told me about the nature of your research i’d like to hear more details of your approach like what is the end goal and what are either your modest or the more audacious goals of your programs at oligomerix we’re developing proximitybased screening assays for identifying inhibitors that prevent tau from selfassociating at the beginning of the aggregation process our end goal would be to identify compounds that we could take into clinical studies – that is the ultimate end goal – and that would require us to bring a partner on board and to get to ind enabling studies right now we are in the candidate lead optimization stage for the project   so how did you come up with the active compounds that you’ve found so far up until this point have you only used the biology as a guide have you been screening library compounds without medicinal chemistry support no we’ve used both supports on the biology side initially when we decided to embark on a program to screen against tau as a target we wanted a solid foundation for the research so we decided not to use the fibrillation type of assays that people were using because they are not physiological that was our departure from the norm secondly most other researchers in the field didn’t use full length tau for technical reasons third most everybody else was using tau sequences with mutations that are not present in ad finally they were using aggregation enhancers or facilitators in their assays we decided since we’re trying to prevent tautau interaction by development of a proximity assay that we needed to work with full length tau because – importantly – if we prevent tau from aggregating we would want to have normal tau that could still be functional or would be able to undergo normal clearance in choosing this path we were able to discover for the first time tau’s ability to selftruncate once it forms these types of aggregates other people missed that because they were using already truncated tau initially our medicinal chemistry was internal and basic – looking through our hits and then designing new structures when our medicinal chemist left at the time we thought it would be a very temporary solution we decided to do our chemistry through a cro we still work with a third party who does all our medicinal chemistry but have now brought on a consultant medicinal chemist and intend to bring this function inhouse ultimately our end goal is to enable a large pharma to more rapidly bring candidates into the clinic we as a small entity would not be able to do that on our own or in a timely manner to bring the funding along to do that or to have the expertise for the full ride however we would like to enable our strategic partner to do that to enable our global common audacious goal of finding effective therapeutics for ad   ok at oligomerix what are the means to the end however you interpret that question so the means are – my interpretation – how do you get there so that’s the money question that’s how i interpret it well we started this project with two scientists plus myself and got oligomerix started by writing an nih grant – an sbir that’s how we got the company off the ground nih has been a very good partner we’ve raised our own money too actually half of the money we’ve raised comes from nih grants and the other half from investors most of our investors are individual investors although we have one institutional investor right now wheatley partners ultimately it’s the investment dollars that come in that enable this program so that’s what i would interpret as the means but also to be in this business you need to have novel technology in terms of oligomerix the majority of the technology we are using we’ve developed inside the company so in other words we created it we’re not inlicensing our novel methods from an academic institution i think that sets us apart as a small company in this field   in the area of tauopathies what new techniques or information have you found particularly interesting well as an example of one of the interesting things because we were working with full length tau we found that tau was selftruncating and the question is ‘what is the purpose of that function’ specifically tau has an intrinsic proteolytic function so that when it forms certain types of aggregates it selftruncates so the real question is whether the function is pathological or protective in trying to understand why this function may have developed in tau we noted that tau is a protein that stabilizes microtubules so why would it have an intrinsic proteolytic function well it also turns out that tau is involved in the stress response system work in other labs has shown that if you treat cells in culture with oxidative conditions tau goes into the nucleus and somehow reduces the number of double strand breaks in the dna i speculate that this novel function may be involved in that process and that maybe this function is going awry in the rest of the neuron in ad this is consistent with our finding that expression of some of these truncated fragments of tau is toxic from a purely scientific perspective tau is a fascinating protein to be working on as its normal and diseaserelated functions are still being unraveled inside and outside of neurons   so can i just ask a clarification – is tau’s proteolytic function something that you believe should be only functional in the nucleus and in a disease state it’s happening outside the nucleus yes however there may be other normal functions for tau proteolytic activity as well both inside and outside of cells that we have not considered   ok so how does oligomerix use cdd vault and why did you choose cdd vault one of the reasons why we chose cdd vault over other packages that we were looking at was that we felt that cdd fit well given that we’re a smaller entity and we didn’t want to choose packages where we thought that big pharma was going to be able to muscle away the attention of the provider so we thought that they fit well with our size and they had all the features that we needed indeed their customer service has been exemplary how are we using it well we’re using cdd vault as a way of storing our chemical structures as a way of searching them as a way of storing all of our assay data we’re also using it for doing calculations for analyzing our data for creating reports and communicating the data to others and then also very importantly for working securely with collaborators so it’s been instrumental for all of those purposes and when we get into a partnership we are looking forward to both ourselves and our partnering company being able to access some of the same data and contributing data into the same database cdd vault is very functional for that another primary concern is having a database where we have better security over our molecules   and you believe that you have better security with a cloudhosted solution like cdd vault than you might have had inhouse i think so yes   and in securely exchanging data with partners yes   so i have to ask if you’ve ever gone the dropbox option we need more powerful drug discovery capabilities than merely a file exchange folder provides however we now use dropbox for standard documents as well   but it has no functionality yeah basically we are also using merrill database for data sharing and have a lot of other types of data that we put in the merrill database we just keep it open all the time because it’s pretty cost effective given the amount of data we have relative to say a larger company you know those are the two kinds of cloudbased type hosted solutions we use at oligomerix cdd vault and merrill then there’s still a lot we’re doing internally we are looking for more ways to leverage using the cloud but at the same time we want to be smart about doing it so we’re sort of being careful in how we implement it and only use providers with trusted track records like cdd which has been securely hosting sensitive data for a longtime   so how long you’ve been using cdd vault if you want to can you enumerate some of the things that you like about it and some of the things that you hope will either be coming in future upgrades or things that you think would if they were addressed make the product even better yes i can easily think of two or three things we like about it i think the search functionalities have been very useful we’ve been happy with those and also the reports that we create also being able to easily update protocols it’s been very good too as we develop new assays then to design them so that we can use them to calculate ic’s and derived parameters like that i also really like that the physicochemical properties are present so you can if you’re making a report check off the ones you want and that sort of thing   how long have you been using cdd vault let’s see i’m trying to think exactly we are in our third year now using cdd vault   right and you do mostly compoundcentric searches or assaycentric searches i mean what kind of searches do you most commonly use we have many of both compound and assaycentric searches one thing we haven’t done is put a lot of the imaging data into cdd vault but that’s something i’d like to do in the future we do have that kind of data you know but right now people maintain that separately one issue that i already talked to charlie weatherall about is in the graphing of curves when you have outliers on your plots you can sequester the outliers but it doesn’t automatically change the axis of the plot we haven’t yet figured out how to change the axis automatically but it seems there must be a way so that part i think is one little area that could be improved however the good news is that you can manually remove outliers but these are little things that could be addressed as we don’t get that many outliers i was telling one of my technicians ‘just don’t have outliers and we won’t have to worry about it’   sure i bet he loved that all right can you also describe the reports that you generate are they primarily for internal use yes internally or with our cro we selectively and securely share our cdd vault also with our cro but we create our reports with password protection so a little different than what others do the good news is with cdd vault you can provide different levels of access privileges to different projects so when we create an excel file then if it has structures we save it as a passwordprotected file and then when we send it to our cro’s that way then in a separate email we send them the password that we feel gives us some level of security that somebody won’t intercept both messages and get sensitive information we just want to be cognizant that we’re protecting our structural information more than anything   all right so why don’t you describe a memorable interaction you’ve recently had with another brilliant scientist well when i was at the alzheimer’s international conference this year there was a lot of talk about tau pet ligands as some people who work in the field know over the last few years there has been a lot of advancement in amyloid research because of amyloid imaging capability now finally tau pet ligands are available and are being validated what was fascinating was when you look at amyloid and tau imaging patterns in the same brains you might have both amyloid pathology and tau pathology and if you look at where the two pathologies are overlapping you see regions of hypoconnectivity so in other words because of this hypoconnectivity or concentrated protein aggregation there is the potential for loss of function in those regions nobody really has demonstrated that but when i was talking to the chief scientist of advent and he pointed those regions out to me i thought that was very fascinating because it implies that there’s a lot of neuronal loss occurring in the places where the two pathologies are occurring in the same region and i think that’s saying something about the disease mechanism that maybe both pathologies are necessary for synaptic loss i think it’s fascinating because for so many years researchers have been struggling to understand what the relationship between these two pathologies so i think we’re finally starting to get at that becoming clearer with this new imaging data what i found was amazing sitting in that hall that day seeing a lot of good presentations of tau imaging data that this is all new – it’s new to everybody in this room these are the world’s experts on tau imaging and to hear them sitting there seeing it at the same time with everyone else it felt like wow it’s almost like you’re looking up the road and you know these are the tools that are going to help us they’re going to help us find treatments that actually can cure or slow down or halt or arrest neurodegeneration and that’s really exciting what a treat as a scientist to be sitting in that room   what technologies do you use for your research and why when we embarked upon this project we developed a novel proximity screening assay where we were able to screen large chemical libraries and then used cellular assays as secondary screens then to demonstrate that our screening assays are selecting compounds that will work in vivo we conduct mouse studies yet the problem with doing mouse studies is that there isn’t any mouse model that really recapitulates alzheimer’s disease and so you’re only looking at a mechanistic piece of the disease in our case because tau was our target we were looking at the tauopathy models now nine out of ten of those models have frontal temporal dementia mutations that are completely irrelevant to alzheimer’s disease so that’s one of the shortcomings being a mechanistic piece of the disease and not the whole disease that’s another shortcoming but at the same time if you can show in one of these models that you’re engaging your target then it also becomes a way of convincing the other stakeholders that you’ve developed some valuable starting point for potential therapeutics that could go into clinical development so the in vivo studies are really a way of building confidence in potential partners a proof of a mechanism proof of validation that your screening assays are informative   so how do you work collaboratively within your group and you can tell me about any collaborations with others what works well what can be better well ad projects are so complicated that you have to work collaboratively because no one person has enough skill to do all of the different aspects of it we have had a number of academic collaborations though we’ve started to limit those and now we’re mainly collaborating with cros one issue with working with academic organizations is that they don’t want to work for fee for service and our investors don’t want to have to negotiate licenses for everything that we’re developing so that’s why we started to work more with cros we are anticipating very collaborative efforts with our partnering company and we intend to be doing most of the biology and some of the chemistry hopefully the right partner will be doing the majority of the chemistry or the chemistry will be done through their cro network it will be very appealing if we’re working with a major pharma and they’re doing the adme the pk and long term toxicity studies for us to be able to search through each other’s databases around any jointly developed ip so the way that i envision doing that is that we both use cdd vault with bigger projects so that’s definitely something that i’m sold on and that we’re looking forward to that in the future   is there any aspect of collaboration that you go outside of cdd vault for or you hope that they put into cdd vault in the future there’s not anything that i can think of right now but i certainly could ask my group to see if anybody else has any ideas from working in our cdd vault because they may have suggestions or some may become apparent when we get involved in a larger pharma collaboration there may be some features that they’re used to with their own databases that we don’t even know exists for instance but right now there’s nothing that comes to mind so its meeting our needs at this stage very well   can i ask have you had anything customized for you to date have you said ‘if we could have it done this way’ and cdd vault has risen to the occasion i don’t think we necessarily had things customized but i think charlie weatherall has helped us out a lot in terms of determining how to best set up our cdd vault how to import our data and do our calculations automatically off of the raw data given the way that we’re running our experiments that requires a certain amount of back and forth to get it just right so i think he’s been very receptive to anything that we needed to do and that’s been good we’re not heavily into computational modeling approaches at this time however this is something we may put more emphasis on in the future we have gotten to the point where we have standardized a lot of our methods and now we’re enforcing best practices so that people don’t change the methods in other words we have sop’s that are signed off on and you have to use those when you run the assay which helps when you are looking at these parameters across many different compounds so once you develop and fully validate an assay you don’t have to worry about it changing over time this is just a question but would there be value for companies like us who didn’t need to have a merrill database because they can get everything in one database with cdd vault with versioning and an audit trail i mean that’s something to think about but for future upgrades   so more of an iplike module yes a module where you could put in all of your documents all of your sops you know all of your reports all of your collaborators reports things like that i mean in the merrill database we have a writeup around our experiment and we have notebook references and we have conclusions you know so they don’t take up a lot of physical space in the sense that these aren’t very big files some of the imaging files probably are pretty big but in general they are not very big files so it’s something that if cdd vault were to build in that functionality then a company like us wouldn’t need to have a merrill database   how far would an electronic laboratory notebook go towards that yes that’s what i think will be the solution right now our notebooks are physical notebooks but they’re all scanned for instance so we are evaluating electronic laboratory notebooks at this time but we haven’t decided to adopt one yet   you know that in  cdd is developing a fully functional electronic notebook yes we’d like to think that we will certainly get to evaluate it i think we know we have to migrate to an electronic format because at some point when we start to work with the large pharmas it’s going to be easier for them to interface with us we don’t want a situation where we have apples and oranges when we’re trying to compare things and creating resistance to collaboration just by virtue of the way they are or we are handling information so that’s important i have seen also that even the scanned notebooks have been extremely helpful because you know it’s a lot easier to access information electronically than going to the filing drawer pulling out the notebook and finding the page so we’re modernizing in those ways and would be interested to see the cdd vault eln that when it gets rolled out   all right so i have a few questions about the process of who in your company uses cdd who logs on about how often they log on who does the searches do you have people in different functions using cdd vault in different ways like you have your biologists who are calculating curves you have your medicinal chemists doing their sar mining… what are the diverse roles or ways that people in your company are using cdd our biologists perform screening assays and import the data to cdd vault and our medicinal chemist and scientists search and analyze the data we also have a regular meeting that cycles through all of the functional areas when we have those we use cdd vault to generate reports that are used to communicate the project status to the whole team so we’re kind of using it both for internal reporting and then also for a little bit with the external reporting as well   and then how do they securely get the information to you they send us encrypted files with the smiles codes and then we incorporate it into our cdd vault it’s working out really well we are working with allen reitz from foxchase chemical diversity center he’s a highly respected medicinal chemist   are you using the new visualization module in cdd vault cdd vision yes we have started to use it to make these four dimensional plots and they’ve actually been very good for communicating our chemical space in fact we had a poster at the alzheimer’s association international conference where we included a colorful plot in the poster directly from cdd vault i think it was a really good communication tool and some of the people coming up were big pharma med chemisttype guys and they were very interested in the plots so it was a useful way to communicate to them what our series looks like across multiparameters that are related to being druglike we’d like to expand off of those early analyses because of course we were very novice at using it i saw today in charlie’s presentation that there are multiple ways that we can enhance our use of it given how powerful the new visualization module really is now the modeling feature is very interesting we did go through that and do one model just to see how it worked i can’t give you an answer as to whether it was predictive i can’t tell you whether the model was effective at finding hits because i think we built such a limited model for the first time that we tried it out that whether the model was functional or not wasn’t that important it was more like a proofofconcept for the experience of building the model but what i would like to do is to try to build a model to use as a way of separating real trends from outlier singletons we have many singletons from our assays that are interesting and we’ve done work around three of them we’ve focused mostly on one series because when you have a series you have more confidence in the underlying signal when we performed a large screen of a hundred thousand compounds some of our series had quite a large number of hits in them and so if you’re getting thirty or forty hits all of the same structural chemotype it easier to focus there but we have also found some success from the limited work that we’ve done on the singletons so the question is instead of trying to do synthesis around many singletons could we do some virtual screening using a cdd built model and would some of those singletons come up more interesting than others and maybe help us to prioritize them so i’d like to see if that works another thing is now that we have a lead series we’re in discussion with some pharmas about whether we could go into their database and pull out similar structures that we can then test so one of the first things that i would love to do is to run a validated cdd model on those structures to see if any hits come up then the real proof in the pudding is as you know do any of them work in the assay so that’s really where you see the potential uses of the model what would make the model valid is its ability to be predictive but it doesn’t mean that it has to predict everything if it’s predicting a subset and it’s pointing you in a direction that would make it useful even if it’s not predicting everything perfectly because we use multiple approaches to solving these hard questions in searching for druglike chemical series for alzheimer’s disease so again i think around the singletons which tend to get ignored anyway that would be one area that i’d like to try to use the modeling more of course you know my background is in molecular biophysics which makes me not afraid of or hesitant to use the modeling functionality   have your research efforts benefitted from your use of cdd vault absolutely our research efforts have benefited using cdd vault it has been a very useful and enabling experience and i recommend it highly to potential users also i am looking forward to seeing some of the other modules you are planning to roll out including the electronic laboratory notebook also i want to take this time to thank you and barry for the opportunity for me and oligomerix to participate in the spotlight this blog is authored by members of the

cdd spotlight interview cdd spotlight interview with james moe – president ceo and a cofounder of oligomerix “we’re using cdd vault as a way of storing our chemical structures as a way of searching them as a way of storing all of our assay data we’re also using it for doing calculations for analyzing our data for creating reports and communicating the data to others and then also very importantly for working securely with collaborators so it’s been instrumental for all of those purposes” james moe president ceo and a cofounder of oligomerix dr moe has  years industrial experience having held senior management positions in product development working on international teams in both early and late stage diagnostic biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies including genetrakamoco technology venturesvysis biomerieux and mosaic technologies prior to founding oligomerix he was director of product development at pyrosequencing senior molecular biologist at spire biomedical and director of product development at qrna inc dr moe received his phd degree in molecular biologymolecular biophysics from wesleyan university did his postdoctoral studies at vanderbilt university in the center for molecular toxicology where he was jointly appointed in the biochemistry department in the medical school and the chemistry department in the college of arts and sciences and has an mba degree with a concentration in entrepreneurial studies from boston university interviewed by shirley louisemay collaborative drug discovery inc i’m here with james moe president and ceo and a cofounder of oligomerix oligomerix is a small biotech company primarily interested in addressing tauopathies tau is a protein in the central nervous system cns that has been implicated in neurodegeneration if there are problems with the pathways downstream or upstream of tau james could you introduce us to the nature of oligomerix’s research sure i’m james moe president and ceo of oligomerix we’re a company that’s focused on tau as a therapeutic target of neurodegeneration for alzheimer’s disease ad but the work that we’re doing also applies to numerous other diseases in fact there’s about twenty different tauopathies that are known to date alzheimer’s disease ad is a dementia that is characterized by the pathological hallmarks plaques and tangles composed primarily of aggregated amyloid beta or tau protein respectively when we embarked on this project we chose to go after tau as a target based on the reproducible pattern of the development and spread of tau pathology during the course of ad and because it was a differentiated approach from most other programs that were targeting the amyloid pathway we also decided to further differentiate ourselves by targeting the oligomeric aggregates of tau rather than the larger and more inert fibril aggregates of tau now after having embarked on this path about eleven years ago or so most of the drug candidates developed against the amyloid target have failed in late stage clinical trials so increasingly there’s a lot of interest in tau as a target and we have a pretty decent head start there we’ve always believed that it’s an important target for ad so we’re trying to discover drugs that prevent tau from aggregating and developing its neurotoxic function   very nice now that you’ve told me about the nature of your research i’d like to hear more details of your approach like what is the end goal and what are either your modest or the more audacious goals of your programs at oligomerix we’re developing proximitybased screening assays for identifying inhibitors that prevent tau from selfassociating at the beginning of the aggregation process our end goal would be to identify compounds that we could take into clinical studies – that is the ultimate end goal – and that would require us to bring a partner on board and to get to ind enabling studies right now we are in the candidate lead optimization stage for the project   so how did you come up with the active compounds that you’ve found so far up until this point have you only used the biology as a guide have you been screening library compounds without medicinal chemistry support no we’ve used both supports on the biology side initially when we decided to embark on a program to screen against tau as a target we wanted a solid foundation for the research so we decided not to use the fibrillation type of assays that people were using because they are not physiological that was our departure from the norm secondly most other researchers in the field didn’t use full length tau for technical reasons third most everybody else was using tau sequences with mutations that are not present in ad finally they were using aggregation enhancers or facilitators in their assays we decided since we’re trying to prevent tautau interaction by development of a proximity assay that we needed to work with full length tau because – importantly – if we prevent tau from aggregating we would want to have normal tau that could still be functional or would be able to undergo normal clearance in choosing this path we were able to discover for the first time tau’s ability to selftruncate once it forms these types of aggregates other people missed that because they were using already truncated tau initially our medicinal chemistry was internal and basic – looking through our hits and then designing new structures when our medicinal chemist left at the time we thought it would be a very temporary solution we decided to do our chemistry through a cro we still work with a third party who does all our medicinal chemistry but have now brought on a consultant medicinal chemist and intend to bring this function inhouse ultimately our end goal is to enable a large pharma to more rapidly bring candidates into the clinic we as a small entity would not be able to do that on our own or in a timely manner to bring the funding along to do that or to have the expertise for the full ride however we would like to enable our strategic partner to do that to enable our global common audacious goal of finding effective therapeutics for ad   ok at oligomerix what are the means to the end however you interpret that question so the means are – my interpretation – how do you get there so that’s the money question that’s how i interpret it well we started this project with two scientists plus myself and got oligomerix started by writing an nih grant – an sbir that’s how we got the company off the ground nih has been a very good partner we’ve raised our own money too actually half of the money we’ve raised comes from nih grants and the other half from investors most of our investors are individual investors although we have one institutional investor right now wheatley partners ultimately it’s the investment dollars that come in that enable this program so that’s what i would interpret as the means but also to be in this business you need to have novel technology in terms of oligomerix the majority of the technology we are using we’ve developed inside the company so in other words we created it we’re not inlicensing our novel methods from an academic institution i think that sets us apart as a small company in this field   in the area of tauopathies what new techniques or information have you found particularly interesting well as an example of one of the interesting things because we were working with full length tau we found that tau was selftruncating and the question is ‘what is the purpose of that function’ specifically tau has an intrinsic proteolytic function so that when it forms certain types of aggregates it selftruncates so the real question is whether the function is pathological or protective in trying to understand why this function may have developed in tau we noted that tau is a protein that stabilizes microtubules so why would it have an intrinsic proteolytic function well it also turns out that tau is involved in the stress response system work in other labs has shown that if you treat cells in culture with oxidative conditions tau goes into the nucleus and somehow reduces the number of double strand breaks in the dna i speculate that this novel function may be involved in that process and that maybe this function is going awry in the rest of the neuron in ad this is consistent with our finding that expression of some of these truncated fragments of tau is toxic from a purely scientific perspective tau is a fascinating protein to be working on as its normal and diseaserelated functions are still being unraveled inside and outside of neurons   so can i just ask a clarification – is tau’s proteolytic function something that you believe should be only functional in the nucleus and in a disease state it’s happening outside the nucleus yes however there may be other normal functions for tau proteolytic activity as well both inside and outside of cells that we have not considered   ok so how does oligomerix use cdd vault and why did you choose cdd vault one of the reasons why we chose cdd vault over other packages that we were looking at was that we felt that cdd fit well given that we’re a smaller entity and we didn’t want to choose packages where we thought that big pharma was going to be able to muscle away the attention of the provider so we thought that they fit well with our size and they had all the features that we needed indeed their customer service has been exemplary how are we using it well we’re using cdd vault as a way of storing our chemical structures as a way of searching them as a way of storing all of our assay data we’re also using it for doing calculations for analyzing our data for creating reports and communicating the data to others and then also very importantly for working securely with collaborators so it’s been instrumental for all of those purposes and when we get into a partnership we are looking forward to both ourselves and our partnering company being able to access some of the same data and contributing data into the same database cdd vault is very functional for that another primary concern is having a database where we have better security over our molecules   and you believe that you have better security with a cloudhosted solution like cdd vault than you might have had inhouse i think so yes   and in securely exchanging data with partners yes   so i have to ask if you’ve ever gone the dropbox option we need more powerful drug discovery capabilities than merely a file exchange folder provides however we now use dropbox for standard documents as well   but it has no functionality yeah basically we are also using merrill database for data sharing and have a lot of other types of data that we put in the merrill database we just keep it open all the time because it’s pretty cost effective given the amount of data we have relative to say a larger company you know those are the two kinds of cloudbased type hosted solutions we use at oligomerix cdd vault and merrill then there’s still a lot we’re doing internally we are looking for more ways to leverage using the cloud but at the same time we want to be smart about doing it so we’re sort of being careful in how we implement it and only use providers with trusted track records like cdd which has been securely hosting sensitive data for a longtime   so how long you’ve been using cdd vault if you want to can you enumerate some of the things that you like about it and some of the things that you hope will either be coming in future upgrades or things that you think would if they were addressed make the product even better yes i can easily think of two or three things we like about it i think the search functionalities have been very useful we’ve been happy with those and also the reports that we create also being able to easily update protocols it’s been very good too as we develop new assays then to design them so that we can use them to calculate ic’s and derived parameters like that i also really like that the physicochemical properties are present so you can if you’re making a report check off the ones you want and that sort of thing   how long have you been using cdd vault let’s see i’m trying to think exactly we are in our third year now using cdd vault   right and you do mostly compoundcentric searches or assaycentric searches i mean what kind of searches do you most commonly use we have many of both compound and assaycentric searches one thing we haven’t done is put a lot of the imaging data into cdd vault but that’s something i’d like to do in the future we do have that kind of data you know but right now people maintain that separately one issue that i already talked to charlie weatherall about is in the graphing of curves when you have outliers on your plots you can sequester the outliers but it doesn’t automatically change the axis of the plot we haven’t yet figured out how to change the axis automatically but it seems there must be a way so that part i think is one little area that could be improved however the good news is that you can manually remove outliers but these are little things that could be addressed as we don’t get that many outliers i was telling one of my technicians ‘just don’t have outliers and we won’t have to worry about it’   sure i bet he loved that all right can you also describe the reports that you generate are they primarily for internal use yes internally or with our cro we selectively and securely share our cdd vault also with our cro but we create our reports with password protection so a little different than what others do the good news is with cdd vault you can provide different levels of access privileges to different projects so when we create an excel file then if it has structures we save it as a passwordprotected file and then when we send it to our cro’s that way then in a separate email we send them the password that we feel gives us some level of security that somebody won’t intercept both messages and get sensitive information we just want to be cognizant that we’re protecting our structural information more than anything   all right so why don’t you describe a memorable interaction you’ve recently had with another brilliant scientist well when i was at the alzheimer’s international conference this year there was a lot of talk about tau pet ligands as some people who work in the field know over the last few years there has been a lot of advancement in amyloid research because of amyloid imaging capability now finally tau pet ligands are available and are being validated what was fascinating was when you look at amyloid and tau imaging patterns in the same brains you might have both amyloid pathology and tau pathology and if you look at where the two pathologies are overlapping you see regions of hypoconnectivity so in other words because of this hypoconnectivity or concentrated protein aggregation there is the potential for loss of function in those regions nobody really has demonstrated that but when i was talking to the chief scientist of advent and he pointed those regions out to me i thought that was very fascinating because it implies that there’s a lot of neuronal loss occurring in the places where the two pathologies are occurring in the same region and i think that’s saying something about the disease mechanism that maybe both pathologies are necessary for synaptic loss i think it’s fascinating because for so many years researchers have been struggling to understand what the relationship between these two pathologies so i think we’re finally starting to get at that becoming clearer with this new imaging data what i found was amazing sitting in that hall that day seeing a lot of good presentations of tau imaging data that this is all new – it’s new to everybody in this room these are the world’s experts on tau imaging and to hear them sitting there seeing it at the same time with everyone else it felt like wow it’s almost like you’re looking up the road and you know these are the tools that are going to help us they’re going to help us find treatments that actually can cure or slow down or halt or arrest neurodegeneration and that’s really exciting what a treat as a scientist to be sitting in that room   what technologies do you use for your research and why when we embarked upon this project we developed a novel proximity screening assay where we were able to screen large chemical libraries and then used cellular assays as secondary screens then to demonstrate that our screening assays are selecting compounds that will work in vivo we conduct mouse studies yet the problem with doing mouse studies is that there isn’t any mouse model that really recapitulates alzheimer’s disease and so you’re only looking at a mechanistic piece of the disease in our case because tau was our target we were looking at the tauopathy models now nine out of ten of those models have frontal temporal dementia mutations that are completely irrelevant to alzheimer’s disease so that’s one of the shortcomings being a mechanistic piece of the disease and not the whole disease that’s another shortcoming but at the same time if you can show in one of these models that you’re engaging your target then it also becomes a way of convincing the other stakeholders that you’ve developed some valuable starting point for potential therapeutics that could go into clinical development so the in vivo studies are really a way of building confidence in potential partners a proof of a mechanism proof of validation that your screening assays are informative   so how do you work collaboratively within your group and you can tell me about any collaborations with others what works well what can be better well ad projects are so complicated that you have to work collaboratively because no one person has enough skill to do all of the different aspects of it we have had a number of academic collaborations though we’ve started to limit those and now we’re mainly collaborating with cros one issue with working with academic organizations is that they don’t want to work for fee for service and our investors don’t want to have to negotiate licenses for everything that we’re developing so that’s why we started to work more with cros we are anticipating very collaborative efforts with our partnering company and we intend to be doing most of the biology and some of the chemistry hopefully the right partner will be doing the majority of the chemistry or the chemistry will be done through their cro network it will be very appealing if we’re working with a major pharma and they’re doing the adme the pk and long term toxicity studies for us to be able to search through each other’s databases around any jointly developed ip so the way that i envision doing that is that we both use cdd vault with bigger projects so that’s definitely something that i’m sold on and that we’re looking forward to that in the future   is there any aspect of collaboration that you go outside of cdd vault for or you hope that they put into cdd vault in the future there’s not anything that i can think of right now but i certainly could ask my group to see if anybody else has any ideas from working in our cdd vault because they may have suggestions or some may become apparent when we get involved in a larger pharma collaboration there may be some features that they’re used to with their own databases that we don’t even know exists for instance but right now there’s nothing that comes to mind so its meeting our needs at this stage very well   can i ask have you had anything customized for you to date have you said ‘if we could have it done this way’ and cdd vault has risen to the occasion i don’t think we necessarily had things customized but i think charlie weatherall has helped us out a lot in terms of determining how to best set up our cdd vault how to import our data and do our calculations automatically off of the raw data given the way that we’re running our experiments that requires a certain amount of back and forth to get it just right so i think he’s been very receptive to anything that we needed to do and that’s been good we’re not heavily into computational modeling approaches at this time however this is something we may put more emphasis on in the future we have gotten to the point where we have standardized a lot of our methods and now we’re enforcing best practices so that people don’t change the methods in other words we have sop’s that are signed off on and you have to use those when you run the assay which helps when you are looking at these parameters across many different compounds so once you develop and fully validate an assay you don’t have to worry about it changing over time this is just a question but would there be value for companies like us who didn’t need to have a merrill database because they can get everything in one database with cdd vault with versioning and an audit trail i mean that’s something to think about but for future upgrades   so more of an iplike module yes a module where you could put in all of your documents all of your sops you know all of your reports all of your collaborators reports things like that i mean in the merrill database we have a writeup around our experiment and we have notebook references and we have conclusions you know so they don’t take up a lot of physical space in the sense that these aren’t very big files some of the imaging files probably are pretty big but in general they are not very big files so it’s something that if cdd vault were to build in that functionality then a company like us wouldn’t need to have a merrill database   how far would an electronic laboratory notebook go towards that yes that’s what i think will be the solution right now our notebooks are physical notebooks but they’re all scanned for instance so we are evaluating electronic laboratory notebooks at this time but we haven’t decided to adopt one yet   you know that in  cdd is developing a fully functional electronic notebook yes we’d like to think that we will certainly get to evaluate it i think we know we have to migrate to an electronic format because at some point when we start to work with the large pharmas it’s going to be easier for them to interface with us we don’t want a situation where we have apples and oranges when we’re trying to compare things and creating resistance to collaboration just by virtue of the way they are or we are handling information so that’s important i have seen also that even the scanned notebooks have been extremely helpful because you know it’s a lot easier to access information electronically than going to the filing drawer pulling out the notebook and finding the page so we’re modernizing in those ways and would be interested to see the cdd vault eln that when it gets rolled out   all right so i have a few questions about the process of who in your company uses cdd who logs on about how often they log on who does the searches do you have people in different functions using cdd vault in different ways like you have your biologists who are calculating curves you have your medicinal chemists doing their sar mining… what are the diverse roles or ways that people in your company are using cdd our biologists perform screening assays and import the data to cdd vault and our medicinal chemist and scientists search and analyze the data we also have a regular meeting that cycles through all of the functional areas when we have those we use cdd vault to generate reports that are used to communicate the project status to the whole team so we’re kind of using it both for internal reporting and then also for a little bit with the external reporting as well   and then how do they securely get the information to you they send us encrypted files with the smiles codes and then we incorporate it into our cdd vault it’s working out really well we are working with allen reitz from foxchase chemical diversity center he’s a highly respected medicinal chemist   are you using the new visualization module in cdd vault cdd vision yes we have started to use it to make these four dimensional plots and they’ve actually been very good for communicating our chemical space in fact we had a poster at the alzheimer’s association international conference where we included a colorful plot in the poster directly from cdd vault i think it was a really good communication tool and some of the people coming up were big pharma med chemisttype guys and they were very interested in the plots so it was a useful way to communicate to them what our series looks like across multiparameters that are related to being druglike we’d like to expand off of those early analyses because of course we were very novice at using it i saw today in charlie’s presentation that there are multiple ways that we can enhance our use of it given how powerful the new visualization module really is now the modeling feature is very interesting we did go through that and do one model just to see how it worked i can’t give you an answer as to whether it was predictive i can’t tell you whether the model was effective at finding hits because i think we built such a limited model for the first time that we tried it out that whether the model was functional or not wasn’t that important it was more like a proofofconcept for the experience of building the model but what i would like to do is to try to build a model to use as a way of separating real trends from outlier singletons we have many singletons from our assays that are interesting and we’ve done work around three of them we’ve focused mostly on one series because when you have a series you have more confidence in the underlying signal when we performed a large screen of a hundred thousand compounds some of our series had quite a large number of hits in them and so if you’re getting thirty or forty hits all of the same structural chemotype it easier to focus there but we have also found some success from the limited work that we’ve done on the singletons so the question is instead of trying to do synthesis around many singletons could we do some virtual screening using a cdd built model and would some of those singletons come up more interesting than others and maybe help us to prioritize them so i’d like to see if that works another thing is now that we have a lead series we’re in discussion with some pharmas about whether we could go into their database and pull out similar structures that we can then test so one of the first things that i would love to do is to run a validated cdd model on those structures to see if any hits come up then the real proof in the pudding is as you know do any of them work in the assay so that’s really where you see the potential uses of the model what would make the model valid is its ability to be predictive but it doesn’t mean that it has to predict everything if it’s predicting a subset and it’s pointing you in a direction that would make it useful even if it’s not predicting everything perfectly because we use multiple approaches to solving these hard questions in searching for druglike chemical series for alzheimer’s disease so again i think around the singletons which tend to get ignored anyway that would be one area that i’d like to try to use
