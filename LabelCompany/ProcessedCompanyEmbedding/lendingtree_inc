expenses simply outweigh your income and savings you may have taken a vacation that cost much more than you anticipated you need to pay for a few college classes to be more competitive for a promotion or you may be a teacher who is forced to spend hundreds of dollars of money on classroom supplies at the beginning of the year there are plenty of different situations where unexpected or needed expenses may arise and exceed the current amount of money in your bank account personal loans can fill the financial gap these loans can be used for just about anything and you can receive anywhere between  to  in a matter of a couple days while a loan that provides quick cash may be tempting here are four things you need to know first about how to get a personal loan will you qualify most likely yes anyone with decent credit can be approved for a personal loan quickly if you dont qualify on your first attempt at getting a personal loan take steps to improve your credit such as paying bills on time and monitoring your credit report to check for any errors or faults with your financial spending what you can use it for personal loans can be used for anything unless the lender sets guidelines on how it may be spent however that doesnt mean a personal loan should be used for anything the best way to use a personal loan is to integrate it into your overall financial plan if you are anticipating big expenses such as a house renovation or a college tuition payment getting a personal loan could benefit you in the long run because you are investing in something of longterm value a college education could help you or your child get a higherpaying job fixing up your house could significantly increase its value getting a personal loan also can help you pay off debts credit cards balances for example are highinterest loans as long as you carry a balance a personal debt consolidation loan will pay off a credit card and other highinterest debts leaving you with one more affordable payment what you shouldnt use it for be cautious about getting a personal loan to pay for expenses that wont benefit you financially in the longterm a lavish dream wedding for example may be fun for a few hours but will leave you with years of debt a clothing shopping spree may give you a great wardrobe but you may be paying off the personal loan years after the clothes are out of style when youre spending part of your monthly budget on a personal loan payment youre also robbing yourself of the opportunity to save money or invest in your retirement they come with interest rates and fees because personal loans generally are unsecured borrowers dont have to make a security deposit or provide collateral this increases the lenders risk which translates into higher interest rates than secured loans a borrowers credit score will also come into play so a high score may help you qualify for a low interest rate while getting a personal loan sometimes can be done without fees some lenders do charge origination or other fees for borrowing be wary of these vendors and be sure to check around for the best rates getting the best rate once youve decided to apply for a personal loan do your homework and shop among lenders for the best rates and lowest fees make sure the terms are favorable and consider a shortterm loan as youll pay less in interest fees than a longterm loan for the same amount get a personal loan  recent personal loan articles getting a loan ways to get a personal loan june   getting a loan where to get a personal loan april   is a secured loan right for you

process each month plus reduces the total amount you owe to your creditors related topics student loan consolidation home equity loans for debt consolidation credit card consolidation consolidate debt with a personal loan debt relief is debt consolidation right for you balance transfer cashout refinancing home equity loans personal loans student loan consolidation pros of balance transfers the interest rate can be very low average introductory rate for balance transfer cards is about  percent only one account to keep track of application and approval is quick and painless upfront fees are low cons of balance transfers you may not qualify for the advertised intro rate if your credit scores are not excellent there is typically a balance transfer fee the interest rate can spike if you’re  days late on your payment that rate could be much higher than the rates of the accounts you paid off the introductory rate is good for a limited time then increases pros of cashout refinancing because the loan is secured by your home the interest rate is much lower than that of debt like credit card balances the interest may be tax deductible check with a tax pro you can lower your monthly payment significantly because home mortgages can have much longer terms stretching out your credit card debt with a tento thirtyyear loan really lowers drops your payment you can get a better rate than that of your old mortgage cons of cashout refinancing the loan is secured by your home so if you can’t make the payment you could end up in foreclosure credit card debt can be discharged in a bankruptcy because it’s unsecured once that debt is secured by a home you can’t discharge it with chapter  filing credit card debt can be discharged in a bankruptcy because it’s unsecured once that debt is secured by a home you can’t discharge it with a chapter  filing cashout refinances take time there’s an application an appraisal a title search etc cashout refinancing has higher upfront costs than any other strategy it’s a good solution only if the new loan has better terms than the mortgage it replaces stretching out your repayment can increase your total interest expense even if the interest rate is lower this can be prevented by making extra principal payments to lower your balance pros of home equity loans because the loan is secured by your property the interest rate is lower the interest is most likely tax deductible replacing multiple accounts with variable rates like credit cards with a single fixed rate loan makes managing debt easier home equity loans have much lower costs than cashout refinances and can be processed much more quickly stretching out your debt repayment over more years can substantially lower your payment cons of home equity loans if you’re unable to make the payment you could end up in foreclosure debt moved from unsecured accounts to a mortgage which is what home equity debt is can no longer be discharged in bankruptcy if your finances are shaky a mortgage is probably not your safest choice stretching out your debt over a longer timeframe may increase the total interest cost even if the interest rate is lower this can be avoided by accelerating your repayment with extra principal payments pros of personal loans personal loans almost always have fixed interest rates making budgeting easier application and processing are very fast you can often get a personal loan in one day personal loan fees are much lower than those of home equity loans or cashout refinances terms range from one to five years so you become debtfree faster personal loans can be discharged in a bankruptcy cons of personal loans personal loans are unsecured so their interest rates are higher than those of home equity loans or cashout refinances because terms are shorter payments are higher if your credit isn’t very good you may not be able to get a lower rate than you’re currently paying on your credit cards pros of student loan consolidation borrowers can lock in a lower interest rate make just one student loan payment each month rather than multiple pay less in interest overall assuming a lower rate and lower term more flexible terms means borrowers can extend their terms for a smaller monthly payment lock in a low fixed interest rate cons of student loan consolidation students who consolidate may no longer qualify for federal loan forgiveness programs the term may be longer making the total amount in interest paid higher borrowers with poor credit could get a worse interest rate than they have now switching from a fixed to a variable rate could mean you pay more down the line if interest rates go up debt consolidation calculator how to consolidate debt in  easy steps no matter what type of debt consolidation loan option

change this loan type home purchase home refinance home price  home price purchase when you get a mortgage to purchase a home the lender uses the lower of the agreedupon purchase price or the propertys appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount the loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loantovalue ratio or ltv that ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate if your ltv exceeds  percent youll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment if the property appraises for less than the agreedon purchase price you are not usually required to complete the purchase home value  home value refinance this is your estimate of the current value of your property when you refinance your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser the refinance loan amount divided by the propertys appraised value equals your loantovalue ratio ltv and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate to get an accurate refinance rate quote your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate down payment  down payment the down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount the higher your down payment the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan if your down payment is less than  percent of the purchase price youll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance which increases your monthly payment mortgage balance home type single family town house condo multifamily coop credit score  credit score your credit score is a number designed to measure your creditworthiness its based on a formula that combines many factors including your payment history

rates might rise today perhaps appreciably however those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day so a shallower rise a holding steady or even a fall all remain possible our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic political and geopolitical news that might affect the american and global economies including market skittishness as a twoday meeting of the federal reserve committee that determines many interest rates begins today while few expect a ratehike announcement tomorrow investors pay close attention to these events in addition the us treasury will be auctioning notes and bills in two auctions today and dc politics are less than calm if we were currently buying a home we would lock our rate now especially if we had to lock anyway in the next couple of weeks read on to discover why you might prefer to float average rates for year fixedrate mortgages held steady yesterday remaining at a low for july however they remain noticeably higher than at some times earlier in the year and a little above the levels seen toward the end of june rates could fall further but there is no guarantee of that what happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming days absent other factors good news tends to push mortgage rates up while bad news usually pulls them down many experts would urge you to lock now particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks others might suggest you continue to float providing you have time to ride out the coming nearinevitable ups and downs they perceive junes and early julys rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli to do with government bond markets in europe rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying us economy but neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility so either way you are taking a chance only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable mortgage rates in the news today further falls in mortgage rates may be on the cards today mortgage rates might fall today – maybe significantly potential for mortgage rates to move significantly today but which way mortgage rates look set to fall again today mortgage rates look likely to fall or hold steady today what does it mean to lock your mortgage locking your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan once your loan is locked thats the rate and price you get regardless of what happens in the financial markets if rates go up youre protected but if rates go down you wont benefit either  you close your loan at the rate youve locked and you can’t change it locks have expiration dates ranging from  to  days or more and the longer your lock period the more it costs if you dont close your loan on time you could end up paying a higher interest rate when should you lock you can lock in your loan at any time during the process until you lock your interest rate you are said to be floating your mortgage the only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance the decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice that’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know mortgage types the type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for see below for the most common types of mortgages and what

lendingtree inc tree donovan jones ipos tech alternative investments ceo venturedealcomventuredealsummarylendingtree has acquired financial comparison site magnifymoney for up to  million in cash and contingent considerationthe deal represents a continuation of trees diversification strategy away from just being a consumer finance marketplaceinvestors view the strategy as a positive and are pushing up the stock in response quick take online loan marketplace lendingtree tree has acquired financial services comparison site magnifymoney for  million in upfront and contingent consideration magnifymoney has created an information resource for consumers to compare various financial products and become more educated in the process with the deal lendingtree is continuing its diversification strategy away from being a pure lending marketplace and investors like the approach so far target company new yorkbased magnifymoney was founded in  to provide consumers with a resource to make sidebyside comparisons of credit and bankingbased products and generate product suggestions via its recommendation engine company founders were nick clements and brian karimzad clements had previously been a managing director at barclaycard uk consumer karimzad had been a vp at goldman sachs gs before cofounding the firm below is a brief demo video about magnifymoney’s service source magnifymoney magnifymoney makes the majority of its revenues from affiliate referrals from some of the products that it reviews management takes pains to state that it has complete editorial control over its reviews and does not receive payment from reviewed services to appear in their product recommendations the site also provides educational guides various calculators and other financial product categories such as credit monitoring and financial budgeting acquisition terms and rationale lendingtree is paying up to  million comprised of  million in upfront cash and  million in the form of restricted stock unit rsus awards based on achievement of certain agreedupon milestones in addition the two founders were awarded  rsus each for a total of  million in current value as of lendingtree’s march   q the company had  million in cash equivalents and restricted cash it had total liabilities of  million so appears to have ample resources to acquire magnifymoney without adverse financial effect the deal represents the second acquisition of financial comparison sites in recent months by lendingtree having acquired comparecards iron horse holdings in november  for up to  million in cash lendingtree is continuing to diversify its approach away from acting as a consumer loans marketplace and toward creating a consumer financial information media brand as lendingtree ceo doug lebda stated in the deal announcement the acquisition of magnifymoney is a continuation of lendingtrees disciplined acquisition strategy and accelerates our product and marketing channel diversification efforts the magnifymoney team has built a successful content platform by generating organic search traffic through unbiased editorial content a technique that complements lendingtrees core business and value proposition while engaging more consumers the successful integration weve achieved with the comparecards acquisition gives us increased confidence in further expanding our portfolio with the addition of magnifymoney and its seasoned team in a rising interest rate environment marketplace lenders and operator have felt the pinch as rates for their financing capabilities have increased additionally their vaunted ability to more accurately assess creditworthiness has come under some question so lendingtree’s diversification efforts continue and appear to be well received by stock market investors responding to the announcement tree was up  as investors are betting the diversification strategy will succeed since management has successfully integrated
