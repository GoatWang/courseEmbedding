investment objective   the fund seeks longterm capital growth   fees and expenses of the fund   this table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund   shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment maximum sales charge load imposed on purchases none maximum deferred sales charge load none   annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment management fees  distribution and service b fees none other expenses  acquired fund fees and expenses   total annual fund operating expenses     acquired fund fees and expenses are the indirect costs of investing in other investment companies the operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the fund’s financial highlights because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the fund   example   this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds   the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based upon these assumptions your costs would be    year  years  years  years       portfolio turnover   the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund’s performance during the most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies   the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in the equity securities common stocks preferred stocks and convertible securities of us companies investments will be made based on their potential for capital growth without limitation on issuer capitalization the fund is nondiversified which means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund       queens road funds     the fund’s investment advisor bragg financial advisors inc invests the fund’s assets by pursuing a valueoriented strategy the advisor’s strategy begins with a screening process that seeks to identify companies whose stocks sell at discounted pricetoearnings pe and pricetocash flow pcf multiples the advisor favors companies that maintain strong balance sheets and have experienced management generally the investment advisor attempts to identify situations where stock prices are undervalued by the market the advisor sells securities when it believes they are trading for more than their intrinsic value to generate tax losses to offset taxable gains or if additional cash is needed to fund redemptions   principal investment risks   as with all mutual funds there is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the fund many factors affect the fund’s net asset value and performance   equity risk   the prices of equity securities rise and fall daily these price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies industries or the securities market as a whole   diversification   because the fund is nondiversified economic political or other conditions that affect the issuers in which the fund may be heavily invested may result in greater fluctuation in the price of the fund’s shares than if the fund was more widely diversified   issuerspecific changes   the value of an individual security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently than the value of the market as a whole   portfolio strategy   the investment advisor’s skill in choosing appropriate investments for the fund will determine in part the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective   small and medium cap securities   the prices of securities of small and medium capitalization companies generally are more volatile less liquid and more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions than securities of larger companies small and medium size companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and they may be dependent upon a limited management group   stock market volatility   stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments   value investing   the value approach to investing involves the risk that those stocks may remain undervalued value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time   who may want to invest in the fund   queens road value fund is designed for investors who seek one or more of the following     • a stock fund with the longterm goal of growth of capital   • a fund to complement a portfolio of other investments   • are willing to accept significant changes up or down in the value of an investment   the fund is not appropriate for investors who     • want to avoid high volatility or possible losses   • want an investment that pursues market trends or focuses on particular sectors or industries   • are pursuing a shortterm goal or investing emergency reserve money   • are seeking a high level of regular income or preservation of capital       queens road funds     performance   the bar chart and performance table below show the variability of the fund’s returns which is some indication of the risks of investing in the fund the bar chart shows performance of the fund’s shares for each full calendar year since the fund’s inception the performance table compares the performance of the fund’s shares over time to the performance of a broadbased securities market index you should be aware that the fund’s past performance before and after taxes may not be an indication of how the fund will perform in the future   performance bar chart calendar years ended december      best quarter

citivalue      aftertax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rate and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes actual aftertax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from those shown the aftertax returns are not relevant if you hold your fund shares in taxdeferred arrangements such as k plans or individual retirement accounts “ira”   the sp citigroup value index is a marketcapitalizationweighted index developed by standard and poor’s consisting of those stocks within the sp  index that exhibit strong value characteristics the sp citigroup value index uses a numerical ranking system based on four value factors and three growth factors to determine the constituents and their weightings the value factors include book value to price ratio cash flow to price ratio sales to price ratio and dividend yield the growth factors include earnings per share growth rate sales per share growth rate and internal growth rate each measured over five years the index is an unmanaged benchmark that assumes reinvestment of all distributions and excludes the effect of taxes and fees individuals cannot invest directly in an index       queens road funds     investment advisor   bragg financial advisors inc   portfolio manager   steve scruggs cfa director of research and senior portfolio manager of the advisor has served the fund as portfolio manager since    purchase and sale of fund shares   the minimum initial investment in shares is  for regular accounts and  for retirement plans and the minimum subsequent investment is  for regular accounts and  for retirement plans you may purchase and redeem shares of the fund on any day that the new york stock exchange is open redemption requests may be made in writing by telephone or through a financial intermediary and will be paid by check or wire transfer   tax information   dividends and capital gain distributions you receive from the fund whether you reinvest your distributions in additional fund shares or receive them in cash are taxable to you at either ordinary income or capital gains tax rates unless you are investing through

reserves the right to invest in other securities which may include other types of stocks such as stocks of larger companies foreign companies growth companies or fixed income investments including investment grade bonds and high risk bonds often called junk bonds   principal investment risks   the risk descriptions below provide a more detailed explanation of the funds’ common principal investment risks except as noted that correspond to the risks described in each fund’s fund summary section of this prospectus   equity risk   the prices of equity securities rise and fall daily these price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies industries or the securities market as a whole individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry andor economic trends and developments the prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response in addition the equity market tends to move in cycles which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time       queens road funds     diversification   the funds are nondiversified therefore each may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of one issuer than diversified funds economic political or other conditions that affect the industries or issuers in which the funds may be heavily invested may result in greater fluctuation in the price of the funds’ shares than if the funds were more widely diversified however each fund does intend to meet certain tax diversification requirements   issuerspecific changes   the value of an individual security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently than the value of the market as a whole   portfolio strategy   the investment advisor’s skill in choosing appropriate investments for the funds will determine in part each fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective the advisor’s judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of a particular security in which a fund invests may prove to be inaccurate and may not produce the desired results additionally if the advisor overestimates the value or return potential of one or more securities the funds may underperform the equity market in general the market may not agree with the advisor’s determination that a stock is undervalued and the stock’s price may not increase to what the advisor believes is its full value it may even decrease in value during these periods relative performance may suffer   small and medium cap securities   medium cap securities risk not applicable to queens road small cap value fund   investing in the securities of small and medium capitalization companies involves special risks among other things the prices of securities of these companies generally are more volatile than those of larger companies the securities of small and medium capitalization companies generally are less liquid and smaller companies generally are more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions in addition it is anticipated that some of the funds’ portfolio securities may not be widely traded and that the funds’ position in such securities may be substantial in relation to the market for such securities accordingly it may be difficult for the fund to dispose of such securities quickly at prevailing market prices investments in securities of companies with small and medium market capitalizations are generally considered to offer greater opportunity for appreciation but also may involve greater risks than customarily are associated with more established companies the securities of smaller and medium companies may be subject to more abrupt fluctuations in market price than larger more established companies small companies have limited product lines markets or financial resources or they may be dependent upon a limited management group in addition to exhibiting greater volatility small cap stocks may to a degree fluctuate independently of larger cap stocks ie small cap stocks may decline in price as the prices of large cap stocks rise or vice versa   stock market volatility   while stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments different parts of the market can react differently to these developments   value investing   the value approach to investing involves the risk that those stocks may remain undervalued value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time while the market concentrates on “growth” stocks in addition a fund may forgo investments that show growth potential if they are inconsistent with its value investment strategy value funds often concentrate much of their investments in certain industries and thus will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers within that industry than would a more diversified portfolio of securities   temporary investments   to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions each fund may invest  of its total assets without limitation in highquality shortterm debt securities and money market instruments these shortterm debt securities and money market instruments include shares of money market mutual funds commercial paper certificates of deposit bankers’ acceptances us government securities and repurchase agreements while a fund is in a defensive position the opportunity to achieve its investment objective will be limited furthermore to the extent that a fund invests in money market mutual funds for cash positions there will be some duplication of expenses because the fund pays its prorata portion of such money market funds’ advisory fees and operational fees each fund may also invest a substantial portion of its assets in such instruments at any time to maintain liquidity or pending selection of investments in accordance with its policies       queens road funds     portfolio holding disclosure   a description of the

value of all portfolio securities cash other assets held by the fund and interest and dividends accrued and subtracting from that amount all liabilities including accrued expenses the net asset value of each fund is divided by the total number of shares outstanding to determine each fund’s nav the nav is calculated at the close of regular trading on the nyse on each business day the exchange is open if the exchange closes early the funds will calculate nav at that time   for purposes of computing nav each fund uses the last reported sales price or quotation for portfolio securities or if market quotations are not readily available fair value will be determined in good faith by the board of trustees if bfa believes in good faith that the market quotations provided do not accurately represent the value of a security the security will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith according to the fund’s pricing policy approved by the board of trustees       queens road funds

roth iras minimum initial investments may be waived if in the investment advisor’s opinion doing so would be in the interest of all shareholders for instance if a group or class of investors would agree to invest amounts on a regular basis such as in a k plan or if the investment advisor has reason to believe that waiving the minimum would allow the funds to attract more assets which would reduce the funds operating expenses for all shareholders once certain asset levels are reached   all orders are subject to acceptance and we may reject purchases to protect other shareholders

it is not reasonably practicable for a fund to fairly determine the value of its net assets or c for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of a fund in determining whether any of the conditions for suspension of redemption are in effect each fund will be guided by the rules regulations and pronouncements of the sec   due to the high cost of maintaining accounts each fund has the right to redeem upon not less than  days’ written notice all of your shares of the fund if through prior redemptions your account has a net asset value of less than  you will be given at least  days’ written notice prior to any involuntary redemption and during such period will be allowed to purchase additional shares to bring your account up to the applicable minimum balance before the redemption is processed   the funds have elected to be governed by rule f under the investment company act of  pursuant to which each fund is obligated during any  day period to redeem shares for any one shareholder of record solely in cash up to the lesser of  or  of the net asset value of the fund at the beginning of the period should a redemption exceed such limitation the fund may deliver in lieu of cash readily marketable securities from its portfolio the securities delivered will be selected at the sole discretion of the fund will not necessarily be representative of the entire portfolio and may be securities which the fund would otherwise sell the redeeming shareholder will usually incur brokerage costs in converting the securities to cash the

price is determined   frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares   the funds do not permit markettiming the funds are intended for longterm investors frequent trading of fund shares also known as “markettiming” is not permitted excessive trading into or out of a fund may harm the fund’s performance by disrupting portfolio management strategies and by increasing expenses accordingly if you engage in this type of activity a fund may suspend or terminate your trading privileges a fund may consider a shareholder’s history in any fund including trading history in other accounts under common ownership or control in determining whether to suspend or terminate your trading privileges all purchases are subject to acceptance by the funds the funds reserve the right to reject any purchases it suspects to be markettiming   in an attempt to deter market timing the funds will use methods including     • selective monitoring of trade activity   • broad authority to take discretionary action against market timers and against specific trades   • reliance on others transfer agents financial intermediaries etc market timing detection practices   each of the methods involves subjective judgments that are consistent with shareholder interests furthermore each of these methods involves some selectivity in their application while the funds will seek to take actions that will detect and prohibit market timing the funds do not represent that market timing can be completely eliminated in any fund for instance a fund may not be able to identify or reasonably detect or deter market timing transactions that may be facilitated by financial intermediaries or made difficult to identify through the use of omnibus accounts by those intermediaries that transmit orders to the fund on behalf of their customers who are beneficial owners to the extent that the funds have omnibus accounts the funds will ensure that brokers maintaining such accounts enter into an agreement with the funds to provide shareholder transaction information to the extent known to the broker to the funds upon request although the funds will take reasonable efforts to eliminate market timing transactions there can be no assurance that the systems and procedures of the funds the funds’ transfer agent and financial intermediaries which submit orders to the funds will be able to monitor all trading activity       queens road funds     distribution and taxes   in general selling shares of the fund and receiving distributions whether reinvested or taken in cash are taxable events depending on the
