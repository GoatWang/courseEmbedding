ginsberg by daniel g jacobs  am edt october    for errol ginsberg maintaining the culture of a company with more than  employees worldwide  particularly in the rapidly growing technology industry  is a particular challenge it’s not an easy task but you might expect a creative response from the president and ceo of ixia who named his company for a flower from his native south africa one way ginsberg he maintains the culture and makes sure employees stay focused and engaged is by showcasing their creativity on the company’s web site which features employee photos taken both on their travels and in their backyards his dedication to maintaining the company culture has paid off ixia a provider of performance test systems to ipbased infrastructure and services has gone from startup to  million in revenue in less than a decade smart business spoke with ginsberg about the importance of trusting your gut being flexible and knowing when to give up some of the control of your company focus on what you knowyou’ve got to have a very clear singular focus with very clear goals of what you are trying to achieve build sell etc that has to be very very clear very simple you have to go after that in an unwavering way as an entrepreneur you’re going to encounter all kinds of things where people will try to dislodge you or discourage you if you have a good vision and a good focus then you can stick with it then you can succeed move to new areas carefullyideally there will be somebody who is intimate with whatever that opportunity is who can help brief us on it you get together and review it and try to come to a consensus about pursuing that opportunity there’s a fair element of gut feel on these things you can do some analysis try to understand the market opportunity but a lot of these things don’t have that kind of data available you have to ask enough questions and at some point you make a decision a lot of times it’s based on prior experience which is really instinctive gut feel act sooner not lateryou don’t always realize you have a problem until it’s gone on for a while they become the bottleneck for the company they want to be involved in every decision every meeting they work  hours a day and it’s still not enough time they stifle the company’s growth you kind of know it when you’re having problems if you’re smart enough you hire people before you have those problems you think you’re doing ok but you’re missing deadlines on releases maybe the quality of your product isn’t where it should be you realize this isn’t working very well find natural leadersa person may have been a very good technical person was promoted to a position of management and failed miserably because they may do a poor job managing it could be because you didn’t give him the right skills or perhaps he just can’t get the respect of the people and the people don’t want to follow that person if people don’t believe in what you are saying and what you are telling them then you can’t lead anybody they have to believe in you to listen to you and follow you otherwise they are going to go around you make smart hiring decisionsat the end of the day you want to be careful about who you hire you want to hire the best people you can find the smartest people you can find and you don’t want to make a mistake  not just for the company but also for that person that person could be quitting another job and if we end up with the wrong hire it messes us up but it messes that person up too he’s in the wrong job it’s a mess for everybody be willing to change directiona company may run into difficulties along the way  market issues product issues the first thing is to recognize that change is needed once you know that you have to galvanize people explain the problem and set a goal that you can get people to believe in and then execute change is not always about building another product change can be somewhere within the company you may have organizational issues and you may have to deal with them acting on them quickly is a difficult thing sometimes you may have people that you’ve worked with for years and you start to realize that the company is outgrowing them you have to make a change that’s a difficult thing to do insist that employees use new systemsyou start off by saying we’d like to do this and use the system then we gave everybody training on the system you can’t just say ‘here’s the system go use it’ even though it’s relatively straightforward to use we trained the folks on it it still wasn’t effective what we had do is say then was ‘you will use this system’ at some point you have to be kind of forceful about it this is now an integral part of how we run this company once people started to understand they weren’t just entering things into a database that nobody cared about they started to take it seriously track salesfrom a sales standpoint we’ve actually done quite a lot we have a much more rigorous system for tracking sales opportunity we put in salesforcecom about two years ago we have gotten very effective in terms of how we use it they don’t like to be monitored in any way whatsoever that’s why they become salespeople they want that freedom of going about their day we don’t try to monitor their day but we do need to know what kind of opportunities they’re working on how to reach ixia   or

solutions events careers about help contact sitemap home  research  market insight movers  shakers interview with errol ginsberg ceo of ixia published  jun  errol ginsberg ceo of ixia by ganapathi subramanian research analyst and jessy cavazos industry analyst and sector leader of the communication test group over the past few years ixias foray into the communication test industry has been significant the company is recognized today as a leader in ip network testing being a key player in the gigabit and  gigabit ethernet testing arena over  ixia has broadened its product portfolio to not only address the needs of network equipment manufacturers such as cisco but also to satisfy the testing requirements of the private enterprise world ixia has risen to the top of the highly competitive communication test industry errol ginsberg its ceo accepted to share with us its view on the industry the company and its future jessy cavazos jc ixia is one of the leading vendors in the communication test  measurement industry from this vantage point what do you consider as the growingemerging opportunities in the communication test space errol ginsberg eg i think the growing opportunities are the ones weve been involved with already these would include  gigabit ethernet we have been doing very well in that area accounting for close to  percent of our revenues in q another opportunity would be security testing vpn devices and systems  definitely a hot area we have very strong products in this area and theres a lot of interest in it also voip is an important area voip has been around for some time but people are beginning to be taking it seriously now and rolling it out on a much larger scale another significant technology of course is wireless we have been relatively successful here with our ixchariot product and we see a fair amount of interest the deployment of wireless hot spots i think that streaming video is going to come into play over the next couple of years we have seen that already in asia mostly in korea and japan people now get high speed connections broadband connections to their homes at a very low cost for instance i was in japan last year in september and i learned that folks can get  megabits per second to their home for around  a month with this kind of speed you can do all sorts of things you couldnt do before the carriers there are rolling out video on demand over these broadband connections and we have been involved in the early testing in that area related to that is ipv there is a tremendous push for ipv coming primarily from japan and korea but also the us government has mandated ipv for all new networking hardware for  i believe ipv is a big area that is being driven by g cell phones essentially each cell phone has its own ip address and with the tremendous proliferation of phones and other internetconnected devices ipv is rapidly becoming obsolete content switches specifically in the webtesting arena is obviously another pretty significant area for us as well jc in your opinion what are some of the key technology trends in this industry and how do you think they will shape tomorrows communication testing industry eg i think i covered that earlier but certainly ipv is a significant emerging trend it is going to become more and more evident over the next year or two wireless is definitely a huge trend it looks like intel is putting a lot of muscle behind what they are calling wimax we will see if that really takes off or not but with intel pushing it it may have a really good chance of taking off also streaming video will definitely continue to grow in importance as increased bandwidth allows for the rapid deployment of converged technologies namely video audio and data jc the industry has been through the downturn over the past  years what are some of the initiatives ixia has put in place to adapt to this evolving marketplace eg early on even in the depths of the downturn we wanted to pretty much stay as we were in terms of people and the size of the company our revenue dipped and our profits dropped but we were still able to make money even with much lower sales we decided to continue with development and in fact continued to hire through the downturn mostly in the engineering area but also in sales and support we went direct in china and japan last year and that is certainly working out quite well especially in japan our approach has been to be somewhat conservative in hiring but we still continue to hire and grow and build new products because our belief is that without new technologies and new products a company is never going to be able to have future growth our rd investment represents around  percent of our revenues currently jc could you illustrate how ixias test solutions meet crucial endusers needs eg a large enterprise that has bought a fair amount of equipment from us is a company like morgan stanley traditionally we havent sold that much to the enterprises we have focused mainly on the nems and over the last year or so we started to sell more to enterprises they are using our products quite successfully now in evaluating networking equipment before they roll the equipment out in their network or before they spend millions and millions of dollars acquiring equipment ixia testing solutions give them the ability to accurately validate the traffic load on their network that comes from deploying new applications or upgrading existing applications adding network users installing new network equipment etc by testing these elements with ixia gear they can measure the impact on their network before they roll out the new applications that saves them a lot of money because they are able to verify that things are going to work the way they are expecting to ahead of time they have a large lab that they have built especially for this purpose to avoid downtime for a company like morgan stanley which is a large financial enterprise if their network goes down during trading time the cost to them is in the millions of millions of dollars a minute so it makes sense for them to invest dollars in test equipment that will save them exponentially in network downtime of course this is quite a high level general example if i look at the nems cisco is obviously our largest customer the equipment that they buy from us is really critical to their projects because when they roll out say a new generation switch or router or firewall or content switch they use our equipment as an integral part of testing their product in the lab before they release it to the field if they didnt use our purposebuilt test platforms they would have to spend tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands dollars on rooms and rooms full of pcs to try to emulate the number of users that the ixia equipment can it is just not a costeffective thing for them to do they can use our equipment in a much more costeffective way because it is much denser takes up less space takes up less power and it is much more manageable an ixia test platform is like having tens of thousand pcs in multiple buildings just in a few racks worth of equipment it is also very easy to maintain our equipment because you are not dealing with thousands of pcs that may have different versions of operating systems a mix of application versions and so on so the cost of maintenance is substantially lower ganapathi subramanian gs youve highlighted earlier ixias expansion across the world could you give us an idea of the distribution that you follow in your primary markets and what are the regions that you consider as key for future growth eg in the us and canada we are direct but we also have manufacturers reps in some geographic regions that are more widely dispersed our sales in japan are almost totally direct although we have a division of ntt that has actually signed ixia up to resell ixias products to other ntt divisions that is kind of a first for ntt to do because typically they will resell equipment like cisco or foundry but they have never sold test gear before as far as i know they found the ixia equipment was an integral part of the overall sale in china we also sell direct in the uk we have a team that covers europe and the middle east including israel in singapore taiwan and australia we typically have distributors but we also have direct people that are in some of those locations as well to help the distributors south america is not a strong point for us currently our hotspots are california the north east focused around boston japan china and taiwan are certainly strong areas including korea but from an asian market perspective japan would be the strongest area in terms of room for growth major growth opportunity i think should come out of china and also europe even though we have been there for a while we have had only a small team there and i think we are barely scratching the surface of europe at the moment obviously we are looking into beefing that up jc ixia has grown in the market place but what are some of the major challenges that are still here for the company and how do you plan to overcome them eg it is always a big challenge to get a costeffective product delivered to the market in time to test new technologies take wimax as an example you want to have the right product out at the right time for the developers to be able to test the products if there are complex protocols involved they can take sometimes months if not a year or more to develop and the trick here is to have close relationships with the development groups in addition to the test groups who are the ultimate users of our products to understand what new technologies are going to be coming down the pipeline that is always a tough challenge the other big challenge from the financial perspective is to grow the sales significantly without growing the expenses significantly basically grow the sales at a greater rate than the expenses to use a financial analyst term get more leverage from our model that is probably the biggest challenge we face  keep the expenses growing at a slower rate of growth than the sales jc talking about product development on average how long does it take you or the industry to develop a product and bring it in the market place eg there is a wide range because it could be as simple as a small software application developed by one or two people to developing a sophisticated product like a voip product which has a team of dozens of people on it so it is all over the map but certainly a reasonable range would be four or five months at the low end to a year or a year and a half at the higher end in the case of the voip product the folks had been working on that product for several years before even bringing it into the market jc how would you rate this performance compared to the competition eg it is hard to say how long our competitors take because we do not necessarily know when they started in general though we tend to come out with products at roughly the same time as our competitors although in some cases we have been a little bit earlier i would say on average our customers tell us they really like us because we are extremely responsive to what they are asking for jc what are some of the other strengths and core competencies of ixia eg i think that we have a tremendous hardware base and we are probably one of the only companies in this segment of the test business which is the iprelated test area that has all of the technologies on a single platform all of our competitors have essentially built their solutions out of a variety of acquisitions with incompatible products for the most part and they have been struggling over a period of several years to integrate these products together with the exception of our voip product which is very new all of our products run on one platform so from a customer standpoint this is very advantageous because they can take a single ixia chassis and by loading different software they can change the personality of the system and they do not have to go buy different chassis or different operating system with unrelated user interfaces and so on to perform different testing functions customers really like that gs when we look at ixia the first thing that comes to mind is that you are a player in the ip network testing market how would you like to project yourself in the future eg we want to be recognized for more than ip network testing we have to convey to both our existing customers and new markets that we have made a significant investment in the voice area and that is why we have started to build a plan to get more awareness in that area we certainly want to continue to be well recognized in the ip testing area we will probably end up doing a lot more work in the standard committees for example we have been working with standard committees for many years but we are going to put more focus into more visibility in some of these committees im referring to the typical standard committees such as the ietf and ieee there are also the industry forums where a combination of companies get together to pursue a specific technology we worked quite closely with the unhiol and the wifi forum for example our ixchariot product is part of the standard recommended procedure for testing interoperability with the wifi forum we have worked with the mpls forum for some time the gige alliance the rpr alliance the metro ethernet forum etc jc overall how would you rate your companys performance in  and what influenced this performance eg we are pretty happy with our performance in  we came at just under  million in revenues so far this year our revenue in q was just around  million so that put us in the excess of a  million run rate for  and we are pretty happy with that performance so far jc how would you rate yourself compared to other market participants eg i would say that our growth is probably higher than the others however sometimes it is difficult to assess the competitors revenue because their revenues that are derived directly from products that compete with ours are buried in larger numbers we know their overall revenues but how the division that is directly competing with us is doing what their exact revenue growth is we may not know that necessarily i think in general we seem to have achieved good recognition amongst our customers we are definitely one of the top companies in the ip network testing business jc what are the products that you have introduced or plan to introduce in the future and what are their advantages eg that comes back to the areas i mentioned earlier which are security voip wireless content switch testing and gig we are going to come up with additional products or significant advancements to existing products that address all of these areas jc actually you recently acquired gnova in the voip arena right eg yes interestingly enough we had some voiprelated test capability through our chariot acquisition which we did last year that allows companies to do predeployment testing over the network for voip basically it can generate voip traffic but it does not do the signaling aspect that is why the acquisition of gnova is so important this is a small earlystage company without a strong sales presence but they have tremendous voip testing technology so we are just starting to roll that out now the nice thing with this company is that we have a very significant development group based in romania we feel that this gives us a pretty good competitive advantage from a cost standpoint because we can expand that group significantly at a much lower cost than it would cost to do that in the united states as a result of this you will see a lot more products from us in the voip area gs how important would acquisitions be for ixia going forward eg very important we continue to look at companies all the time we have a pretty large engineering group but we cannot do it all so we continue to look at acquisitions the acquisitions we are looking for tend to be somewhat smaller the gnova size as opposed to a merger where you try to buy a lot of revenue we like to integrate it fairly completely into the company so we will continue to do that it is definitely a key strategy for us going forward jc since a lot of tm vendors are relatively optimistic for  they are all looking at the acquisition market what kind of consolidation do you see happening in the communication test industry eg there are a lot of smaller companies out there that are looking to get acquired investment banks approach us every day with names of companies they think may be useful to us a lot of these companies tend to be in the  to  million revenue range they are usually too small to do an ipo they typically are missing some product segments and so they start to feel that they are not going to survive easily and really grow so they are looking to get acquired most of them tend to be in the network monitoring network management related field when i say network management i dont mean hp openview kind of management i mean more like application monitoring jc who does ixia consider to be competition and how does the company differentiate itself eg our primary competitors that we see on a daytoday basis are spirent and agilent we see in some situations anritsu mostly internationally our competitors do a pretty good job at some areas but we feel we have very strong products in the areas that we cover our customers like our products because of the scope of testing they allow them to do some of our customers have much deeper testing needs and they feel they can only get that from our products sometimes it can be a kind of a disadvantage for us because the flexibility of what we offer will sometimes appear to new users as a little harder to use we encounter that at times but in general the depth of what we offer and the fast response we proved are what we think really makes us stand out jc are there any alliances or partnerships that you expect to make in the coming year eg i mentioned that we definitely keep on looking for additional acquisitions well probably make another couple over the next year were definitely much more active in talking to a number of companies where we think partnerships either marketing or sales make sense where we can improve or have a better offering for our customers by integrating some products not necessarily through an acquisition but through a technology partnership you will probably see some of that over the next  months as well jc what is your take on when the recovery will begin and what is likely to induce it do you think we have seen these signs in  so far eg i think some of these things are selffulfilling prophecies a lot of what people say about recovery is based on what they read in the newspapers if everybody says there is a recovery then everyone thinks there is a recovery you read that pc sales have picked up significantly that semiconductor vendors sales have picked up that they are making a lot more money reporting a lot more profits you read that a lot of the larger carriers plan to spend more on capital equipment over the next few years folks like verizon plan to spend billions of dollars on network upgrades the rate of rollout of dsl has caught up with cable modems now the big carriers intent on rolling out dsl services dont want to lose to the cable companies and i think it is a good thing for everybody because it lowers the cost of broadband connections more people have broadband connections which means more traffic on the internet which means more upgrades are needed it looks like the enterprises are starting to upgrade their networks for the first time in several years i think they are spending money on upgrading pcs my feeling in general about the market is quite positive it appears that we are definitely on the recovery phase right now in the growth phase in fact it is not a massive growth phase but i think it is a good recovery that is beginning jc as a conclusion what do you think the future holds for the communication test  measurement industry and more specifically ixia eg over the last several years that i have been in this business testing requirements have moved up the stack going from layer  ethernet switches to layer  routers and to content switches where layer  testing is essential more and more intelligence is being put into these network devices i think that what this translates into is much more software in both the devices as well as in the test devices that test these new intelligent network boxes what that means is very large software projects for everybody as the hardware becomes less and less differentiated over time the unique capabilities of the software becomes more and more important i think that you can see this transition in terms of the revenue make up for a whole range of test companies where software is becoming a much more important component of the complete sale rather than giving away the software simply to promote the hardware software is going to be key to the future sign in to read the rest of this article not signed up register now forgot your password search help desk full list of offices for more information
