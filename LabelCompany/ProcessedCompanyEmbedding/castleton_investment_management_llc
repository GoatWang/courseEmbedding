environmental impact this priority can—and often does—coexist with other investment goals impact portfolios are built upon the investment grade fixed income strategy and can be applied as an overlay to any investment style within that strategy beyond enhanced credit selection an impact portfolio undergoes rigorous independent third party preinvestment screening coupled with postinvestment

are not limited to fixed income securities exchanged traded funds preferred stock and mutual funds clients may select from three styles capital preservation this goal focuses on minimizing portfolio risk and providing a safe and reliable income stream liquidity and credit is considered more strongly than income stable income this goal focuses on principal protection but also aims to improve or stabilize income with liquid and diversified instruments these securities may be of some credit or maturity risk income opportunity this goal aims to accept a level of calculated risk to satisfy income this investment style may include holdings that could be more speculative in terms of credit maturity or liquidity close special strategies these strategies seek to capitalize on opportunities in distressed and other securities that castleton believes to be undervalued by the marketplace these opportunities seek potential capital gains as well as income as a general rule special strategies are identified rather than actively sought this typically occurs when a bond issuer comes under severe pressure due to a number of market and financial developments when these pressures create the potential for a significant rise in yield castleton carefully analyzes factors including liquidity possible bankruptcy and risk of market access to assess the risk and value of the potential investment special strategies typically have a higher turnover rate than traditional strategies and are pursued when castleton feels the price of securities justify the risk the risks of any particular special strategy may not be suitable for all clients close trust we establish a foundation of trust with our clients by committing ourselves to the highest standard of ethics in all
