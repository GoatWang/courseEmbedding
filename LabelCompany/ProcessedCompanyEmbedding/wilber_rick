i think the reviewer who stopped at  mark may have missed the best part i came away reminded that greatness  habits rick talks about being prolific someone is quoted who says something like to have lots of great ideas have lots of ideas and toss out the bad ones the part that sticks wme the most is when rick suggests writing songs constantly because thats your art rather than simply writing because you have an album deadline to meet as a book writer this inspires me to keep writingwhether a book deadline is looming or not why because greatness lies in the practice of your art boring and irrelevant reviewer sfuchs  february   rick rub sound very dry and boring i listen  of the whole thing but it was a torture i did not get it do not know what the other reviewers before me are talking about but this dialog had very little substance was nonengaging with questionable flow i do not recommend it interesting reviewer loveschools  april   interesting beyond genremaking space for greatness reviewer una mccann  august   great dialogue between ken wilbur and rick rubin ken and rick discuss what it is that enables rick to be able to capture the peak essence of the artists he records this is not just a surface dialogue the listener is left with insights as to what it is to express greatness in this particular scenario it takes the form of music recording more details

chapter the story begins with my seeming to make love to chloe cary she working to revive her career me looking to get mine started the faux sex was good and afterward we lay in bed both on our backs staring at the ceiling wondering what we could do next to keep it entertaining i thought it had all gone very well it was mybob promised very editablechloe was a nice young lady too nice and too young at twentythree really for the likes of me an athlete worn out at thirtytwo shed had a starring role two years before in a comedy box sitcom that had disappeared after eight episodes and now she was in the running for a recurring role in the very popular the family madderz sitcom she needed it — she needed to get things back on the rails before she got too old at say twentyfour she was on a media tour that included sweep interviews so wed met at habana café to eat and chat over bistec de pollo while i swept to my audience every tasty bite and every stirring look at those famous wet lips of hers as we sipped on mojitos and took our time with the meal sweeping was very new then and the audience was small but the idea of it seemed good to me and id risked pretty much everything on its future chloe was a lucky break for me the kind of audiencebuilder i neededthe idea was that wed have a faux relationship and help both our careers some dinner and alcohol a walk on the beach more drinks on my back deck with that splendid view of the gulf of mexicos setting sun the green flash if we were lucky and all the while those initial little touches — her hand brushing mine my fingertips on the small of her back as she came through the door her reaching over to put her hand on my arm as we talked about how the sun seemed to flatten at the base so it looked like an old bowler hat albeit an orange one or a classically styled ufo right before it disappearedand then that look her eyes into mine those lips opening as i leaned in toward her — toward them — and we finally kissed and it was as warm and wonderful and wet as it was scripted our standing there on the beach suited sweeping perfectly with my sensory wash adding to the visuals and soundthe numbers were good mybob my helpmate had whispered them to me as we went through the motions eight thousand at dinner nine thousand for the walk on the beach over ten thousand for the sunset and those touches and then up to twelve thousand for the edited lovemaking give or take there werent more than five hundred thousand receivers in the country at that point  in fact said the everexact mybob so these were phenomenal numbers thank you chloeand so now we lay there enjoying the damp glow of the aftereffects her numbers no doubt were ten times higher but all she offered was oldmedia sight and sound i offered touch and taste and smell and as soon as i could afford the surgery the full limbic scalable turn it up to eleven we had to remember to talk about that chloe and i so her audience would come back to me when the upgrade went ini blinked with my eye to end the feed knowing mybob would handle the fadeout and the staytunedformore and then i yawned shook my head in pleased amazement while i unclicked the contacts and pulled the bowl amp out of my ear and looked over at chloe she was beautiful no question the straight black hair and those famous bangs those breasts the lips smiling now as she listened to the fadeout in her own feed and said that was great peter thank you mybetty tells me your numbers were like superchloe had a disconcerting way of ending her sentences with a question mark whether they deserved it or notthe numbers were great chloe thanks i saidshe sat up holding on to the sheet to cover her breasts and smiled at me i put a lot into that i was like nervous about it its like weird isnt itthe sensory side you mean now i was doing it good grief you get used to it you learn to make it part of the showyou know thats a first for me sweeping i meani blinked and no one told me your agent didnt tell mineher smile was killer she put her legs over the side of the bed and stood up silhouetted by the thin light of the moon through the sliding glass door that led out to the deckdont worry about it she said kind of a virgin thing going on right first time probably just like made it better rightsure i said betterit was clear that she wasnt the sharpest tool in the shed but the lovemaking had been really good and the conversation was fine when we were live so she could act even if she couldnt hold an actual conversation and truth was i liked her nice young lady heart of gold and all that i bet she loved puppiesshe reached down to touch my lips and grinned i did enjoy that peter it wasnt all acting you knowme too i saidshe turned to look out toward the gulf and that sliver of moon why dont you put the bowl amp back in and click it live and well go for a romantic like walk on that beach of yoursgreat idea i had to admit thinking how the audience would love the romancemybob i said to my helpmate send a ping to the subscribers and let them know well be live in five minutes for a walk on the beach all rightdone said mybob and i put the bowl amp back into the right ear and clicked it in while chloe slipped into shorts a tshirt and flipflops and then i did the same and we headed out for a walk on the beachmy house sits behind a protective row of sand dunes that the state of florida keeps replacing as the beach erodes and the water keeps rising in twenty years they say high tide will wash right over our little barrier island and the last of the milliondollar stilt homes will be torn down as the island — or whats left of it — becomes a state park ill miss the place — its my childhood homebeyond the dunes is the open gulf usually placid but increasingly violent as the years go by and once when i was very young horrific in its anger to get through the dunes you stroll along a long winding wooden boardwalk designed to keep you from doing harm to the sea oats that anchor the dunes you can see the green blinks of the spyeyes atop poles anchored in the dune step off the boardwalk and youll get a twohundreddollar dunes violation notice blinking in your inboxmybob said live in five seconds as we reached the three steps at the start of the boardwalk the steps are worn and uneven and chloe stumbled in the dark i grabbed her hand to help her and then didnt let go as we walked along the boardwalk toward the water the moon offered enough light to make it easy to navigate once our eyes adjusted but chloe hung on to my hand as she chattered on about the offers she was supposedly considering a hospital drama where she was a surgeon a family sitcom set in paris a feature film set on a martian colony i didnt know if any of those offers were real but of course i was amazed and pleased for her officially which meant squeezing her hand and stopping along the way to give her another kissshe kept talking as we reached the end of the boardwalk and stepped down onto the dry sand of the upper beach then we walked down toward the water what plans did i have would i go back into sportscasting or stick with sweepcasts didnt know i said and was there any chance id make a comeback in basketball with the new league starting up shed heard id been offered a playercoach job with the columbus comets maybe i would be the livesweep coach and player would i consider that maybe i said and on and onshe knew her lines for sure and hit about every bullet point wed mentioned in the contract so that was fine and then she got personal did i have any brothers or sisters yes one of each both of them younger no we werent close these days and my parents both were dead i didnt go into how they died my father i told her had been a nice enough guy but busy and distant my mother was the one whod really raised three rowdy beach kids and kept us in schoolfatherd had his secrets but i didnt tell chloe any of thosethe moon was behind us and the slight shorebreak of the gulf was in front magic stuff and i took full advantage of it taking in a deep breath of the salty air and noticing purposefully the feel of the sand beneath my feet so fine and compact that it squeaked as i walked a sound not all that different from basketball shoes on a parquet floori stopped and watched as chloe walked down toward the water stepped out of her flipflops and into the shorebreak to stand there in the warm shallow water the sweep caught it all the sand the sea glinting in the moonlight the rustle of the shorebreak over the sand the feeling of the sand beneath my feet the smell of the salt water and the faint tang of chloes perfume or skin lotion something faintly citrusshould i go for a swim she askedsure i said it stays shallow until you get way out there just dont go out past the second sandbar i laughed thats what our mother always told us have fun but dont go out too fargreat she said and turned around to face me then started stripping off her tshirt and shorts as i blinked twice to enhance for low lighti watched her knowing it was all more for the sake of the sweep than for me but that was fine — the ratings would go through the roof with that body that face she finished the strip and then turned to wade into the inky water up to those calves then to the waist then walking over the first sandbar and into the deeper water and then she was swimming heading out past the marker buoys and that second sandbar i zoomed to keep track of her in the midnight blue of the gulf hoping this wouldnt turn into a shark sweep as she got out into the deeper water and then turned to face me and shout come on outbut i didnt couldnt with my bowl amp in a little salt water on the amp or corrosion on the contacts and id be out at least two hundred grand to replace them and i no longer had that kind of money so i waved back and shouted no thanks and then walked along the beach keeping pace with her as she swam parallel to the shore she could really swim little dolphin chloe and that made for a pretty good sweep too even in low lighta few hundred meters down the beach near the next boardwalk she started splashing yelled something and i was about to yank out the bowl amp and go out to help her corrosion be damned a sand shark jellyfish sea turtle there were a lot of possibilities out there past that second sandbarbut then she calmed down waved and started swimming in hard for the beach i waded out calfdeep to meet her as she got in to where it was shallow enough to stand upoh my god she was shivering as she came to me and i hugged her and brought her back onto the beach we didnt have towels and id stupidly left her tshirt and shorts back up where shed waded inwhat happenedsomething was out there peter no ending in questions now no dropping in the like every third word this was for the record and great drama and chloe knew itwow i said playing to the moment whatd you seei took off my tshirt and started wiping her dry with it she shivered great stuff i didnt get a good look but it was something big and smooth it ran along my right leg and then when i stopped and yelled it went by so close i could feel the water move it was huge i mean really hugewas she doing all this for the sweep maybe but if she was she was a much better actor than id thoughtshe slipped my tshirt on and then came into my arms i hugged her hard you didnt actually see anything no finsshe shook her head something six or seven meters long i thinki smiled there wasnt much that big in these waters at least nothing that big that wouldnt have taken a nice bite out of chloe as it passed by still i bet it was a porpoise chloe there are a lot of them around here they wont hurt you probably just wanted to playplaysure i saidoh peter she said and put her head on my shoulder her hair smelled wonderfully of salt and water her face still wet from her swim was damp and cool against my chesti wondered if it had been a porpoise i hadnt heard of that kind of behavior from one of our beach porpoises but it made a kind of sense to me we had a lot them along these shores and they were used to swimmers and sometimes came right up to check people out maybe it was a porpoise that made more sense than its being a shark since she was standing here alive with all four limbs in place had it been a bull shark for instance that wouldnt be the case we had a lot of those too along these beaches id had a runin with one myself back in the daychloes shivers were gone she pulled her head back from my shoulder looked at me eye to eye smiled then leaned up to kiss me lets go get my things and get back to your house oksure well get you into the shower and rinsed off and then you can stay the night or ill have mybob call for your car whatever you likeshe stepped back took a deep breath threw her arms out wide and put her face up to look at the stars and the moon there were storms in the distance out in the gulf you could see the distant lightning but couldnt hear the thunder most of the sky though was cloudless its beautiful here peterit is that i said and looked up myself thinking if she stayed i could haul out the telescope and show her saturns ringsand there nearly directly overhead something was moving a satellite maybe no two of them no five morea group of satellites moving across the sky in a slowly changing pattern it made no damn sense at all ufos thered been a big scare the year before in brazil but you know get reali pointed at them and chloe looked to see them what are they she wanted to knowno idea i said but i was sure sweeping them full zoom seeing it happen they looked to me like the space stations both of those went overhead often enough and i had mybob tell me when the situation was right for me to see one or the other bright in the night sky as they reflected the light of the sun always zooming along until they fell into shadow and faded awaythese looked the same but some of them were moving in random patterns while others sailed sedately along in a straight line there were slight flares of light here and there among the lights i counted ten of them just when the first of them faded into darkness as it moved into the earths shadow and then the rest and that was that interesting while it lasted just a couple of minutes all told there and then gonedid we get all that mybob i asked my helpmate and we did he said back and asked i havent posted it yet should i nowsure i said why the hell notand he did that and so thats how ones life changes with a why the hell notchapter sweeping had its critics too explicit too few filters on the content too much celebrity and not enough real news too much action too little privacy too little effort to establish context too much tits and ass and not enough shakespearebut the receiving sets were selling well and it was possible that within six months sweeping would really be the next big thing and id gotten in early and so didnt mind all the carping one thing id learned during my basketball career was to ignore the critics id never read what the sportswriters had to say didnt make friends with them didnt try to win them over i just played my game got my rest and stayed out of troubleand so it was with sweeping it is by its nature a very public endeavor inviting an audience into your head and your heart and asking them to come along for the ride crazy invasive foolishall of those things yes but after the insanity of the first few weeks when id worn out mybob with instructions on keeping my first channel running twentyfour mostly boring hours a day id learned to just play my game pick my spots and then shut it down every night at some point and just like hoops get my rest and stay out of trouble even as my numbers climbed as a sweeper i had mybob log off when i slid into theta waves mybob read the interface and when i slid into sleep he uncoupled me from the clouds in fact i set mybob on manual and had to click in to recouple so i could enjoy that halfawake state for a while in the morning as the sun came through the blinds and the smell of blue mountain coffee percolated upstairs from the kitchen below i thought of all this as my daily visit to digital rehab continues excerpted from alien morning by rick wilber copyright   rick wilber excerpted by permission of tom doherty
