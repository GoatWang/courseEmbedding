matherby courtney helland caroline caress sarah damico maggie gelon  sydney maretteon april th  ogilvy and mather released doves newest campaign choose beautiful which was accompanied by a new spot social experiment and social media campaign which is all ongoingobjectivesaccording to doves senior global director victoria sjardin dove wanted to inspire women to seize the opportunity to choose what makes us feel beautiful everyday  because when we do it unlocks confidence and happinessdoves vision through this campaign is to encourage womens positive relationships with themselves and the way they appear on the outside which impacts each womens realization of their own goalsthis vision encourages using dove products indirectly and rather through the experience the company creates for each consumertarget audience analysisthe target audience for this campaign is women worldwide the primary demographic is limited to exclusively womenthis includes all ages races sexual orientations and socioeconomic standings in regards to psychographics dove has participated in many research studies to discover how women perceive themselves in the context of beautyhow many women told us they felt anxious about the way they lookusa china india uk brazil this study also demonstrated that a high percentage of women found qualities of other women beautiful but didn’t see it in themselves target audience analysis continuedin our opinion the campaign concept demonstrates an adequate understanding of doves target audience through their tailored researchwe also believe the campaign succeeds in emotionally connecting with the audience by identifying common feelings of vulnerability and low selfesteem through research the company was then able to transform that data into an emotional messagevisuals that include women of all body types race and age have helped to foster the idea of beauty in all forms social experiments involved in their advertising such as choosing to walk through a door labeled “average” or “beautiful” also specifically invokes an emotional decision and challenge the participants and viewers to reevaluate their emotions and perceptions brand identity  developmentdove conducted the study previously discussed which asked women from different countries about beauty results showed a high percentage of women found qualities of other women beautiful but didn’t see it in themselvesbased on those findings the big idea developeddove used this opportunity to further develop the brand with another mission we’re women we’re powerful choose beautifulproducts development continued creating body wash shampoo etc the big ideadove challenges the idea that women don’t have to wait for a magazine trend or person to tell them they’re beautifulgoal of the campaign is empowerment and that women need to start deciding for themselves that they are beautifulthe ultimate goal wasn’t only to create a product brand but to insight actioncompany executivess stated it wasn’t about a product based affair it was about creating change for the next generationin  dove created a fund which partnered with girl scouts boys and girls clubs and girls inc which is still in affect and continues to enhance their brands values today this campaign was also not regarding doves products but instead their corporate responsibilityinvolvementdove products are advertised as a high affective involvement product affective involvement requires the expending of emotional energy and evoking of deep feelings about a decision or product there is low to moderate cognitive involvement based on the purchasing of dove productsthe creative concept of the campaign reflects this affective involvement by invoking pathos in statements such as “choose beautiful” and challenging women to define themselves as “beautiful” or “average”call to actionthe call to action is prominent in the tagline “choose beautiful the simple imperative wording challenges women to evaluate the way in which they perceive themselves and then to intentionally choose to value themselves as beautiful direct response campaign“choose beauty” is not a direct response campaign rather than inciting consumers to purchase the product directly from the advertiser the advertisement promotes a change of perspective with that in mind the brand name dove is clearly featured so consumers are reminded of the brand values and personalityeffectiveness feedbackcreative concept for a low cognitive involvement productcampaign improvementsthe best way to determine the effectiveness of this campaign is evaluate the discussion around it dove’s “choose beauty” campaign has definitely sparked some conversation the huffington post stated “the results are a powerful commentary on how many women perceive their own beautyothers have a different point of view such as jean killbourne creator of killing us softly advertising’s image of woman who said “it puts it all on women we should just shape up and increase our selfesteem as if it were that easy” many people have mixed feelings about the choose beauty campaign but it continues to be popular and dove continues to keep producing ads campaign ethicsdove took the initiative to let women know that it’s okay to be confident and feel beautiful in their own skin by focusing the efforts to better the lives of consumers dove has created a very socially and ethically responsible campaign even if the intentions of the campaign was positive there was still some negative backlashagency spy calls the campaign unnatural and it doesnt have the same convincing narrative arc that many of the brands more successful initiatives dotech times believes that women dont necessarily have to feel beautiful to have high selfesteemtech times also points out that to make matters worse for the women who walked through the average door dove confronted them about their choice on the camera suggesting that walking through the average door automatically meant the women had low self esteemwe would not limit the campaign to targeting only women the message of loving the skin you are in can apply to both genders giving the rising statistics of men unsatisfied with their body image a coed campaign may do surprisingly well we would also not limit the vernacular of the campaign to physical beauty for instance limiting the choices in the commercial to “beautiful” or “average” is reinforcing categories that dove is trying to break emphasizing people are much more than the exterior would be more inclusivecritics knock the campaign for being patronizing collecting feedback through surveys and focus groups to improve upon tone may be usefulogilvy  mather took doves low cognitive involvement product and through this campaign focused on turning it into a lifestyle product and brandthey didnt focus on the selling the specific product but instead on the lifestyle and persona the brand it trying to support which is of high selfesteem and feeling comfortable in ones own skinthis created an emotional connection to the product and brand through the soft music chosen and inspirational words from the subjects in the video and reallife responses on social media outletsdove and ogilvy  mather historyogilvy  mather began doves real beauty campaign back in its mission was to to make women feel comfortable in the skin they are in to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxietysince then they have continued the campaign through many other tactics including various videosone video example is dove real beauty sketcheschoose beautiful is the newest campaign ogilvy  mather has produced for dove which has also created a social media movement with the hashtag
