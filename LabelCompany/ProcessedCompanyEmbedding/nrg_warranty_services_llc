knowledgeable and very helpful in walking us thru the process they didnt hide anything as a realtor and homeowner i have always recommended new buyers to purchase a home warranty its worth the cost

service man to contact you can seem like an eternity once they arrived they called and ordered the parts and had them fedex express overnighted he was there first thing in the morning sitting outside in his truck waiting for the fedex delivery to arrive overall i have been extremely satisfied with first american warranty once i even looked at other warranty companies prior to renewing just to see if i could save some money but bang for the buckrepairs and appliances that that first american warranty covers by default tend to be a premium upgrade with all of the other warranty companies unfortunately my copay has gone up slightly every year and i assume that is because i have actually used this warranty but it is still a lot cheaper than paying for the complete cost out of my own pocket roy s  ca    first time buyer of this type of insurance moved into a house that has a pool that sprang a new leak in the pool filter luckily it was covered by the policy judie barker  ca

before and have not had any problems this time had ac problems the technician diagnosed the problem very quickly after i explained what it was doing my ac unit was repaired in  minutes bad capacitor i did have one small beef to say that it did take a week to get out to the job but maybe thats probably due to few techs for their area maybe they could refer to another service co as a backup

hearing a salesperson tell you something and then actually experiencing it really confirms to me this companies commitment to its customers when i purchased this home warranty the salesperson i spoke

week we had in las vegas and they got someone out the same day was fixed and up and running that evening fortunately my repair was done with only the service fee chris  pa    i received hsa from the seller for free when i purchased a house so far i had to call them for a hot water tank issue and furnace issue the hot water tank after a couple visits and part replacements eventually got replaced with a bran new one the plumber gave great service and was prompt and i had no issues with his service or hsas service the furnace was the same way it ended up being an easy fix but still the service was great on by both hsa and the repair tech even if i would have paid for the hsa warranty it would have paid for itself in a few months i definitely recommend it for anyone buying a new house as for someone who is really handy or has been in their house for a while it really depends on the shape of your appliances the warranty is a little pricey to have everything properly covered but it definitely helps when something unexpected happens joseph reyes  oh    i have had nothing but the best experience with our hsa home warranty buying a home is stressful enough but having the peace of mind knowing that problems can be fixed is priceless yes customer service can be tough to get on the phone it is very frustrating but once on the phone they are professional and very easy to deal with they are also very responsive in giving updates on repairs once in progress the website portal to start a repair is effortless and is the easiest way to go we have never had an issue getting our repairs completed or having competent individuals complete the work in todays world everyone wants their issues fixed instantaneously but the reality is sometimes it takes time as long as you are cognizant that things break at the most inopportune time and you have to take a deep breath and go through the process you will be fine all of our service provider have been professional and exception in their repair process i will continue to renew our policy for as long as hsa will allow vicki  mo    our air conditioner quit on a saturday morning and i called hsa by sunday morning i had a call

pleasant they are very friendly and easy to discuss issues with angus macmillan  ut    after having but never using this warranty for alomst a year i had a regrigerator and swamp cooler go out in the same weekno problem i thought i have this home warranty the seller included in the price of the home unable to reach anyone by phone or email after many attempts i finally opened an online service request the next day i was contacted by a refrigerator repair company telling me the soonest they could get out was a week from today that was not acceptable so i tried calling landmark at least  times waiting on hold for ever opened up a chat window from their website which remained inactive for a full  minutes and sent them emails from both their website and directly with zero response i did not hear from anyone except to receive an email that they had charged my credit card  for the fridge repair order it was not until i threatened to give them a poor review that i got a somehwat personally directed email to cut a long story short i ended up cancelling both service tickets and booked service myself with people coming out in two days vs a week in both cases the service fees for the onsite calls were less than the  deductible from landmark and both fees would credit against any repair cost in closing i am not sure that anyone actually works at landmark other than in their web team i think the company is a shell and like the wizard of oz with has a few short wizards pulling knobs and dials behind a large landmark home warranty web curtain my adviceput   month in the bank for repairs and forget about buying landmark home warranty erica schaefer  tx    once i placed the service request i received a call regarding my request within  minutes it was july th the next morning the service technician was out and everything was fixed easy questions to answer great customer service jocelyn durant  tx    i have had landmark since april i have since had to use them twice the first to have the house rekeyed and had the most amazing service from landmark and the service provider the second service request for was the dishwasher which stopped working which we discovered after closing landmark provided excellent customer service throughout this process with prompt follow up efforts to find and locate parts and contacting the service provider when needed they were able to solve my challenge with a pay out i have been extremely satisfied with landmark warranty and would highly recommend them to others heather  tx    this is the second home we have warrantied thru landmark our experiences have always been positive most of our claims have been appliance repairs fridge and washing machine some of the contractors have been better than others but all seemed adequate and several were outstanding if there have been delays in repairs it is typically because a part had to be ordered or because the issue occurred on the weekend when contractor was not working you cannot fault the warranty company or even contractor for that my thought is that if im able to get what would otherwise be an expensive out of pocket repair completed for a minimal charge and a few days wait then im getting what i paid for i have been pleased with the polite and helpful staff at landmark when ive placed calls about a service request if everything continues as it has thus far i expect to continue doing business with landmark for years to come  home warranty  add to compare call now for a free quote  rating premium  deductible  effective  days after enrollment bbb rating b

first experience with this company but so far im very happy with them and i would recommend them to all my friends and family  frank d  tx    they have been excellent for me they are very courteous and professional i have dealt with marc in sales and this nice lady jasmine in the claims service section they are always really friendly  even when i have called in all aggravated and flustered that my air conditioning stopped working i got a call from the ac repair man about  minutes after i hung up with claims i thought about giving them  stars instead of  because the repair man couldnt fix the issue on the spot when he came out because he had to order a part  then i thought to myself that to hold that against them would be pretty unreasonable so based on my experience i rate them  out  stars and i highly recommend them if you are looking for a home warranty company joan h  tx    this company lives up to its name  they are always available i used them twice both times i called around midnight and happy i get to speak to a live person the repairman came out quick and was good too very professional so far so good im a happy customer christina rodriguez  id    defintely a very

owner of the vehicle and a warranty company the warranty company agrees to pay for repairs identified in advance during the specified warranty period a warranty period is generally based on car mileage anywhere from one thousand to several tens of thousands of miles the longer the coverage the higher the price of the auto warranty warranties are often purchased in lump sum amounts but certain companies also offer monthly payment plans auto warranties are generally considered a wise purchase since the cost of car repairs can easily exceed thousands of dollars however that reasoning only holds true if the auto warranty covers the repairs needed auto warranty contracts have a lot of fine print understanding the scope of coverage is imperative to making a wise purchase you also

best auto warranty plans available today we hope you find these reviews helpful in finding the best auto warranty that fits your needs   go to reviews   the basics of auto warranties cars are expensive investments whether you like to purchase new or preowned in protecting that investment and to avoid future repair expenses on your car you may want to consider purchasing an auto warranty most new and some used cars are covered by some sort of warranty when purchased for example new cars are usually covered by a manufacturers warranty these warranties vary greatly and are limited in duration they may cover a variety of repairs until either a time limit or mileage limit such as three years or  miles once you reach that time or mileage limit the warranty will either totally expire or much of what it covers will be void some manufacturers also offer various program warranties on specific used or preowned cars usually called certified used or something similar that extend the original manufacturers warranty or parts of the warranty if you plan on keeping the car past the life of the manufacturers warranty you may want to consider purchasing an extended warranty extended warranties are insurance policies against expensive unforeseen repairs in essence extended warranties are actually service contracts they cover expenses incurred that your warranty doesnt cover unlike manufacturers warranties extended warranties are purchased separately from your car they can be purchased either through the original manufacturer or through a thirdparty independent warranty company in some cases youll receive offers to purchase extended warranties in the mail or over the phone from the manufacturer just as the original manufacturers warrantee is expiring extended warranties are all different they each differ on what repairs are covered how much is covered duration of the coverage and cost of the warranty before purchasing any extended warranty determine what is still covered on the warranty you possess determine how long past the life of the warranty youll keep the car what you want covered and for how long when researching the details of the warranty you want to purchase look for information on the policys deductible whether the policy is transferable if you sell the car and whether repairs can be done anywhere or only with specific shops also look for specifics on what is covered and what is not for instance does the warranty cover breakdown of parts as well as wear and tear a warranty that only covers breakdown requires the part to break before the warranty will pay to replace it a wear and tear policy will cover parts that need to be replaced because they are too worn to work efficiently purchasing an extended warranty can be a smart investment dont forget to research the warranty specification and the companies offering them online before making the purchase   auto warranty in the news your corner wrench when warranties wont save your wallet
