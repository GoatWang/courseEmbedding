fund quarterly review q  the hatteras core alternatives institutional fund lp the “fund” outperformed the benchmark as well as the broader equity markets by finishing the quarter slightly down the fund’s benchmark the hfrx global hedge fund index posted a  loss for the quarter the sp  tr index finished the quarter down  and global equities as measured by the msci world index sold off even further down  with heavy volatility throughout the quarter the fund’s private investment strategy bounced back significantly from a rather quiet first quarter to lead all of our strategies and return over  for the quarter josh e parrot caia hatteras funds  aug   private investments with an overall weighting of  and a positive  return the strategy contributed significantly to the fund’s overall performance the private strategy’s returns over the first quarter were relatively flat however the strategy rose with vigor over the spring months reporting a positive  in may after its positive  return in april the quarter’s positive performance illustrates the competitive edge of the private investment approach that not only incorporates higher return potential but also adds a much needed element of diversification away from the public markets the uplift in returns over the quarter resulted heavily from the strong performance in the private energy strategy due to the falling prices of natural gas and overall volatility of commodity markets many private energy funds have shifted their focus towards unconventional resource plays these emerging plays are tied to technological improvements in the oil and gas industry and have been a growth driver in domestic oil and gas production new and evolving technologies such as horizontal drilling d seismic and hydraulic fracturing have permitted oil and gas companies to access reserves of previously unrecoverable oil and natural gas the implementation of these unconventional resource projects is highly capital intensive and require management expertise to execute therefore these unconventional resource plays have presented an opportunity for private energy funds to fill a need where capital market funding is not readily available these opportunities have resulted in strong returns for our managers illustrating the agile and strategic nature of the private energy sector to opportunistically invest in areas that are not readily available in the public markets the other compelling characteristic of our private strategy has been its growing maturity in the fourth quarter of  quarterly distributions from underlying funds were larger than quarterly contributions to funds we have seen this trend continue into  as yeartodate distributions represented around  of capital contributions if this trend plays out and distributions continue to outweigh contributions cash previously used to fund capital calls can now be opportunistically deployed for liquidity needs or additional investments thus placing less capital needs on the portfolio from a cash standpoint the uptick in distributions is also an indicator that the investments are entering a prime period of their life cycle where valuations and exits could accelerate together we believe the current environment presents vast opportunities for private equity given public markets continue their volatility and capital market funding becomes less available with the growing maturity and ample diversification offered in the private asset portfolio we believe the impact of this strategy will continue to provide excess risk adjusted returns not available in a typical fund of hedge funds or traditional investment portfolio hedge fund strategies our hedge fund strategy was down  during the quarter and most of the losses can be attributed to our emerging market and energy themes these themes were two of our best performing positions during the first quarter but the ramifications of a global economic slowdown clearly hurt some of these higher beta exposures our tactical trading strategy helped offset the market volatility and dislocation during the quarter and ended as our best performing hedge fund strategy with a significant positive return opportunistic equity opportunistic equity is currently a  weight and was down just over  for the quarter due to emerging markets technology and energy exposures during the quarter we allocated to a new global longshort equity manager and we remain bullish on the long term potential of the emerging economies despite the recent price dislocations in particular we are emphasizing the emerging market consumer story and we continue to search for other hedged methods to implement this theme in addition our managers have been increasing their gross exposures in anticipation of a more fundamental stock picking environment this earnings season and we are especially bullish on longshort equity as a strategy in the nearterm as we believe quality will start to matter again enhanced fixed income enhanced fixed income at an  weight was down  for the quarter we continue to diversify away from enhanced fixed income and more into tactical trading and absolute return as better volatility mitigators as such we have been reducing our distressed debt exposure but we remain bullish on structured credit and rmbs in particular the recent rally in treasuries during the quarter created even more opportunities as spreads widened versus rmbs securities absolute return absolute return was down  for the quarter and is currently a  weight with the near term market uncertainty we allocated to two new absolute return funds during the quarter within our multistrategy and relative value substrategies we also reduced our event driven exposure within the strategy to further mitigate volatility our multistrategy managers continued to add positive returns for the quarter and have been the best performing funds for the strategy since last year tactical trading tactical trading which incorporates managed futures ctas global macro and tail risk strategies has a  weighting and was the best performing hedge fund strategy the strategy particularly proved its worth during the market dislocation in may and finished the quarter up nearly  despite a tumultuous june our discretionary cta’s and tail risk substrategies were the dominant drivers of performance within tactical trading and both finished with solid midsingle digit quarterly returns to help offset the overall volatility in the markets outlook we believe the second half of  will be much more volatile than the first half and we have positioned the hedge fund portfolio accordingly a lack of fiscal union in europe the pending fiscal cliff facing the us and the overall global economic slowdown could all provide challenging head winds our blend of hedge funds and private investments stood up well during the most volatile periods of the quarter and we believe the fund is well positioned to deliver unique benefits particularly from our private investment strategy whereas we are defensively positioned in the hedge fund portfolio the private investment strategy remains poised to capitalize on a number of exposures  an average age of over  years for the underlying private portfolio companies is a significant milestone as exit opportunities in private investments tend to begin in earnest in years three through five often these controloriented active management style investors are starting to unlock the value they’ve created since their original purchases  technology investments made not only in our venture capital funds but also through private energy are opening up new markets despite macro volatility  there is a gap between the public equity markets where values have doubled since march  and the significant discounts found in private equity companies this separation will persist but is starting to narrow as ma activity and ipos resume like they did in q  as always we appreciate

prior written notice the success of the fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the fund’s investment manager although the investment manager for the fund expects to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation investment performance and strategy in most cases the investment manager has little or no means of independently verifying this information the underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments by investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the fund investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees both at the fund and underlying fund levels certain underlying funds will not provide final schedule
