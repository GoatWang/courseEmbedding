investment management activities collectively mfs have adopted proxy voting policies and procedures as set forth below mfs proxy voting policies and procedures with respect to securities owned by the clients for which mfs serves as investment adviser and has the power to vote proxies including the pooled investment vehicles sponsored by mfs the mfs funds references to clients in these policies and procedures include the mfs funds and other clients of mfs such as funds organized offshore subadvised funds and separate account clients to the extent these clients have delegated to mfs the responsibility to vote proxies on their behalf under the mfs proxy voting policies and procedures the mfs proxy voting policies and procedures include a voting guidelines b administrative procedures c records retention and d reports a voting guidelines  general policy potential conflicts of interest mfs policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what mfs believes to be the best longterm economic interests of mfs clients and not in the interests of any other party or in mfs corporate interests including interests such as the distribution of mfs fund shares and institutional client relationships mfs reviews corporate governance issues and proxy voting matters that are presented for shareholder vote by either management or shareholders of public companies based on the overall principle that all votes cast by mfs on behalf of its clients must be in what mfs believes to be the best longterm economic interests of such clients mfs has adopted proxy voting guidelines set forth below that govern how mfs generally will vote on specific matters presented for shareholder vote as a general matter mfs votes consistently on similar proxy proposals across all shareholder meetings however some proxy proposals such as certain excessive executive compensation environmental social and governance matters are analyzed on a casebycase basis in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances of the proposal therefore mfs may vote similar proposals differently at different shareholder meetings based on the specific facts and circumstances of the issuer or the terms of the proposal in addition mfs also reserves the right to override the guidelines with respect to a particular proxy proposal when such an override is in mfs best judgment consistent with the overall principle of voting proxies in the best longterm economic interests of mfs clients mfs also generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer are held by multiple client accounts unless mfs has received explicit voting instructions to vote differently from a client for its own account from time to time mfs may also receive comments on the mfs proxy voting policies and procedures from its clients these comments are carefully considered by mfs when it reviews these guidelines and revises them as appropriate these policies and procedures are intended to address any potential material conflicts of interest on the part of mfs or its subsidiaries that are likely to arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of mfs clients if such potential material conflicts of interest do arise mfs will analyze document and report on such potential material conflicts of interest see sections b and d below and shall ultimately vote the relevant proxies in what mfs believes to be the best longterm economic interests of its clients the mfs proxy voting committee is responsible for monitoring and reporting with respect to such potential material conflicts of interest mfs is also a signatory to the united nations principles for responsible investment in developing these guidelines mfs considered environmental social and corporate governance issues in light of mfs fiduciary obligation to vote proxies in the best longterm economic interest of its clients  mfs policy on specific issues election of directors mfs believes that good governance should be based on a board with at least a simple majority of directors who are independent of management and whose key committees eg compensation nominating and audit committees consist entirely of independent directors while mfs generally supports the boards nominees in uncontested or noncontentious elections we will not support a nominee to a board of a us issuer or issuer listed on a us exchange if as a result of such nominee being elected to the board the board would consist of a simple majority of members who are not independent or alternatively the compensation nominating including instances in which the full board serves as the compensation or nominating committee or audit committees would include members who are not independent mfs will also not support a nominee to a board if we can determine that he or she attended less than  of the board andor relevant committee meetings in the previous year without a valid reason stated in the proxy materials or other company communications in addition mfs may not support some or all nominees standing for reelection to a board if we can determine  the board or its compensation committee has repriced or exchanged underwater stock options since the last annual meeting of shareholders and without shareholder approval  the board or relevant committee has not taken adequately responsive action to an issue that received majority support or opposition from shareholders  the board has implemented a poison pill without shareholder approval since the last annual meeting and such poison pill is not on the subsequent shareholder meetings agenda including those related to netoperating loss carryforwards  the board or relevant committee has failed to adequately oversee risk by allowing the hedging andor significant pledging of company shares by executives or  there are governance concerns with a director or issuer for directors who are not a ceo of a public company mfs will vote against a nominee who serves on more than five  public company boards in total mfs may consider exceptions to this policy if i the director is either retired or listed as professional director in the proxy statement ii the company has disclosed the directors plans to step down from the number of public company boards exceeding five  within a reasonable time or iii the director exceeds the permitted number of public company board seats solely due to either hisher board service on an affiliated company eg a subsidiary or service on more than one investment company within the same investment company complex for directors who are also a ceo of a public company mfs will vote against a nominee who serves on more than three  publiccompany boards in total however we will support his or her reelection to the board of the company for which he or she serves as ceo mfs may not support certain board nominees of us issuers under certain circumstances where mfs deems compensation to be egregious due to payforperformance issues andor poor pay practices please see the section below titled mfs policy on specific issues  advisory votes on executive compensation for further details mfs evaluates a contested or contentious election of directors on a casebycase basis considering the longterm financial performance of the company relative to its industry managements track record the qualifications of all nominees and an evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders majority voting and director elections mfs votes for reasonably crafted proposals calling for directors to be elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast andor the elimination of the plurality standard for electing directors including binding resolutions requesting that the board amend the companys bylaws provided the proposal includes a carveout for a plurality voting standard when there are more director nominees than board seats eg contested elections majority vote proposals classified boards mfs generally supports proposals to declassify a board ie a board in which only onethird of board members is elected each year for all issuers other than for certain closedend investment companies mfs generally opposes proposals to classify a board for issuers other than for certain closedend investment companies proxy access mfs believes that the ability of qualifying shareholders to nominate a certain number of directors on the companys proxy statement proxy access may have corporate governance benefits however such potential benefits must be balanced by its potential misuse by shareholders therefore we support proxy access proposals at us issuers that establish an ownership criteria of  of the company held continuously for a period of  years in our view such qualifying shareholders should have the ability to nominate at least  directors companies should be mindful of imposing any undue impediments within its bylaws that may render proxy access impractical including resubmission thresholds for director nominees via proxy access mfs analyzes all other proposals seeking proxy access on a casebycase basis in its analysis mfs will consider the proposed ownership criteria for qualifying shareholders such as ownership threshold and holding period as well as the proponents rationale for seeking proxy access stock plans mfs opposes stock option programs and restricted stock plans that provide unduly generous compensation for officers directors or employees or that could result in excessive dilution to other shareholders as a general guideline mfs votes against restricted stock stock option nonemployee director omnibus stock plans and any other stock plan if all such plans for a particular company involve potential dilution in the aggregate of more than  however mfs will also vote against stock plans that involve potential dilution in aggregate of more than  at us issuers that are listed in the standard and poors  index as of december  of the previous year in the cases where a stock plan amendment is seeking qualitative changes and not additional shares mfs will vote its shares on a casebycase basis mfs also opposes stock option programs that allow the board or the compensation committee to reprice underwater options or to automatically replenish shares without shareholder approval mfs also votes against stock option programs for officers employees or nonemployee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee that give free rides on the stock price or that permit grants of stock options with an exercise price below fair market value on the date the options are granted mfs will consider proposals to exchange existing options for newly issued options restricted stock or cash on a casebycase basis taking into account certain factors including but not limited to whether there is a reasonable valueforvalue exchange and whether senior executives are excluded from participating in the exchange mfs supports the use of a broadbased employee stock purchase plans to increase company stock ownership by employees provided that shares purchased under the plan are acquired for no less than  of their market value and do not result in excessive dilution shareholder proposals on executive compensation mfs believes that competitive compensation packages are necessary to attract motivate and retain executives however mfs also recognizes that certain executive compensation practices can be excessive and not in the best longterm economic interest of a companys shareholders we believe that the election of an issuers board of directors as outlined above votes on stock plans as outlined above and advisory votes on pay as outlined below are typically the most effective mechanisms to express our view on a companys compensation practices mfs generally opposes shareholder proposals that seek to set rigid restrictions on executive compensation as mfs believes that compensation committees should retain some flexibility to determine the appropriate pay package for executives although we support linking executive stock option grants to a companys performance mfs also opposes shareholder proposals that mandate a link of performancebased pay to a specific metric mfs generally supports reasonably crafted shareholder proposals that i require the issuer to adopt a policy to recover the portion of performancebased bonuses and awards paid to senior executives that were not earned based upon a significant negative restatement of earnings unless the company already has adopted a satisfactory policy on the matter ii expressly prohibit the backdating of stock options and iii prohibit the acceleration of vesting of equity awards upon a broad definition of a changeincontrol eg single or modified singletrigger advisory votes on executive compensation mfs will analyze advisory votes on executive compensation on a casebycase basis mfs will vote against an advisory vote on executive compensation if mfs determines that the issuer has adopted excessive executive compensation practices and will vote in favor of an advisory vote on executive compensation if mfs has not determined that the issuer has adopted excessive executive compensation practices examples of excessive executive compensation practices may include but are not limited to a payforperformance disconnect employment contract terms such as guaranteed bonus provisions unwarranted pension payouts backdated stock options overly generous hiring bonuses for chief executive officers unnecessary perquisites or the potential reimbursement of excise taxes to an executive in regards to a severance package in cases where mfs i votes against consecutive advisory pay votes or ii determines that a particularly egregious excessive executive compensation practice has occurred then mfs may also vote against certain or all board nominees mfs may also vote against certain or all board nominees if an advisory pay vote for a us issuer is not on the agenda or the company has not implemented the advisory vote frequency supported by a plurality majority of shareholders mfs generally supports proposals to include an advisory shareholder vote on an issuers executive compensation practices on an annual basis golden parachutes from time to time mfs may evaluate a separate advisory vote on severance packages or golden parachutes to certain executives at the same time as a vote on a proposed merger or acquisition mfs will support an advisory vote on a severance package on a on a casebycase basis and mfs may vote against the severance package regardless of whether mfs supports the proposed merger or acquisition shareholders of companies may also submit proxy proposals that would require shareholder approval of severance packages for executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds mfs votes in favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder approval of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a certain multiple of such officers annual compensation that is not determined in mfs judgment to be excessive antitakeover measures in general mfs votes against any measure that inhibits capital appreciation in a stock including proposals that protect management from action by shareholders these types of proposals take many forms ranging from poison pills and shark repellents to supermajority requirements mfs generally votes for proposals to rescind existing poison pills and proposals that would require shareholder approval to adopt prospective poison pills unless the company already has adopted a clearly satisfactory policy on the matter mfs may consider the adoption of a prospective poison pill or the continuation of an existing poison pill if we can determine that the following two conditions are met  the poison pill allows mfs clients to hold an aggregate position of up to  of a companys total voting securities and of any class of voting securities and  either a the poison pill has a term of not longer than five years provided that mfs will consider voting in favor of the poison pill if the term does not exceed seven years and the poison pill is linked to a business strategy or purpose that mfs believes is likely to result in greater value for shareholders or b the terms of the poison pill allow mfs clients the opportunity to accept a fairly structured and attractively priced tender offer eg a chewable poison pill that automatically dissolves in the event of an all cash all shares tender offer at a premium price mfs will also consider on a casebycase basis proposals designed to prevent tenders which are disadvantageous to shareholders such as tenders at below market prices and tenders for substantially less than all shares of an issuer mfs will consider any poison pills designed to protect a companys netoperating loss carryforwards on a casebycase basis weighing the accounting and tax benefits of such a pill against the risk of deterring future acquisition candidates proxy contests from time to time a shareholder may express alternative points of view in terms of a companys strategy capital allocation or other issues such shareholder may also propose a slate of director nominees different than the slate of director nominees proposed by the company a proxy contest mfs will analyze proxy contests on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the track record and current recommended initiatives of both company management and the dissident shareholders like all of our proxy votes mfs will support the slate of director nominees that we believe is in the best longterm economic interest of our clients reincorporation and reorganization proposals when presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the laws of a different state or to effect some other type of corporate reorganization mfs considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of such a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure mfs generally votes with management in regards to these types of proposals however if mfs believes the proposal is in the best longterm economic interests of its clients then mfs may vote against management eg the intent or effect would be to create additional inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers issuance of stock there are many legitimate reasons for the issuance of stock nevertheless as noted above under stock plans when a stock option plan either individually or when aggregated with other plans of the same company would substantially dilute the existing equity eg by approximately  as described above mfs generally votes against the plan in addition mfs typically votes against proposals where management is asking for authorization to issue common or preferred stock with no reason stated a blank check because the unexplained authorization could work as a potential antitakeover device mfs may also vote against the authorization or issuance of common or preferred stock if mfs determines that the requested authorization is excessive or not warranted repurchase programs mfs supports proposals to institute share repurchase plans in which all shareholders have the opportunity to participate on an equal basis such plans may include a company acquiring its own shares on the open market or a company making a tender offer to its own shareholders cumulative voting mfs opposes proposals that seek to introduce cumulative voting and for proposals that seek to eliminate cumulative voting in either case mfs will consider whether cumulative voting is likely to enhance the interests of mfs clients as minority shareholders written consent and special meetings the right to call a special meeting or act by written consent can be a powerful tool for shareholders as such mfs supports proposals requesting the right for shareholders who hold at least  of the issuers outstanding stock to call a special meeting mfs also supports proposals requesting the right for shareholders to act by written consent independent auditors mfs believes that the appointment of auditors for us issuers is best left to the board of directors of the company and therefore supports the ratification of the boards selection of an auditor for the company some shareholder groups have submitted proposals to limit the nonaudit activities of a companys audit firm or prohibit any nonaudit services by a companys auditors to that company mfs opposes proposals recommending the prohibition or limitation of the performance of nonaudit services by an auditor and proposals recommending the removal of a companys auditor due to the performance of nonaudit work for the company by its auditor mfs believes that the board or its audit committee should have the discretion to hire the companys auditor for specific pieces of nonaudit work in the limited situations permitted under current law other business mfs generally votes against other business proposals as the content of any such matter is not known at the time of our vote adjourn shareholder meeting mfs generally supports proposals to adjourn a shareholder meeting if we support the other ballot items on the meetings agenda mfs generally votes against proposals to adjourn a meeting if we do not support the other ballot items on the meetings agenda environmental social and governance esg issue mfs believes that a companys esg practices may have an impact on the companys longterm economic financial performance and will generally support proposals relating to esg issues that mfs believes are in the best longterm economic interest of the companys shareholders for those esg proposals for which a specific policy has not been adopted mfs considers such esg proposals on a casebycase basis as a result it may vote similar proposals differently at various shareholder meetings based on the specific facts and circumstances of such proposal mfs generally supports proposals that seek to remove governance structures that insulate management from shareholders ie antitakeover measures or that seek to enhance shareholder rights many of these governancerelated issues including compensation issues are outlined within the context of the above guidelines in addition mfs typically supports proposals that require an issuer to reimburse successful dissident shareholders who are not seeking control of the company for reasonable expenses that such dissident incurred in soliciting an alternative slate of director candidates mfs also generally supports reasonably crafted shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure around the companys use of collateral in derivatives trading mfs typically supports proposals for an independent board chairperson however we may not support such proposals if we determine there to be an appropriate and effective counterbalancing leadership structure in place eg a strong independent lead director with an appropriate level of powers and duties for any governancerelated proposal for which an explicit guideline is not provided above mfs will consider such proposals on a case by case basis and will support such proposals if mfs believes that it is in the best longterm economic interest of the companys shareholders mfs generally supports proposals that request disclosure on the impact of environmental issues on the companys operations sales and capital investments however mfs may not support such proposals based on the facts and circumstances surrounding a specific proposal including but not limited to whether i the proposal is unduly costly restrictive or burdensome ii the company already provides publiclyavailable information that is sufficient to enable shareholders to evaluate the potential opportunities and risks that environmental matters pose to the companys operations sales and capital investments or iii the proposal seeks a level of disclosure that exceeds that provided by the companys industry peers mfs will analyze all other environmental proposals on a casebycase basis and will support such proposals if mfs believes such proposal is in the best longterm economic interest of the companys shareholders mfs will analyze social proposals on a casebycase basis mfs will support such proposals if mfs believes that such proposal is in the best longterm economic interest of the companys shareholders generally mfs will support shareholder proposals that i seek to amend a companys equal employment opportunity policy to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and ii request additional disclosure regarding a companys political contributions including trade organizations and lobbying activity unless the company already provides publiclyavailable information that is sufficient to enable shareholders to evaluate the potential opportunities and risks that such contributions pose to the companys operations sales and capital investments the laws of various states or countries may regulate how the interests of certain clients subject to those laws eg state pension plans are voted with respect to social issues thus it may be necessary to cast ballots differently for certain clients than mfs might normally do for other clients foreign issuers mfs generally supports the election of a director nominee standing for reelection in uncontested or noncontentious elections unless it can be determined that  he or she failed to attend at least  of the board andor relevant committee meetings in the previous year without a valid reason given in the proxy materials  since the last annual meeting of shareholders and without shareholder approval the board or its compensation committee has repriced underwater stock options or  since the last annual meeting the board has either implemented a poison pill without shareholder approval or has not taken responsive action to a majority shareholder approved resolution recommending that the poison pill be rescinded in such circumstances we will vote against director nominees also certain markets outside of the us have adopted best practice guidelines relating to corporate governance matters eg the united kingdoms and japan corporate governance codes many of these guidelines operate on a comply or explain basis as such mfs will evaluate any explanations by companies relating to their compliance with a particular corporate governance guideline on a casebycase basis and may vote against the board nominees or other relevant ballot item if such explanation is not satisfactory in some circumstances mfs may submit a vote to abstain from certain director nominees or the relevant ballot items if we have concerns with the nominee or ballot item but do not believe these concerns rise to the level where a vote against is warranted mfs generally supports the election of auditors but may determine to vote against the election of a statutory auditor in certain markets if mfs reasonably believes that the statutory auditor is not truly independent some international markets have also adopted mandatory requirements for all companies to hold shareholder votes on executive compensation mfs will vote against such proposals if mfs determines that a companys executive compensation practices are excessive considering such factors as the specific markets best practices that seek to maintain appropriate payforperformance alignment and to create longterm shareholder value we may alternatively submit an abstention vote on such proposals in circumstances where our executive compensation concerns are not as severe many other items on foreign proxies involve repetitive noncontroversial matters that are mandated by local law accordingly the items that are generally deemed routine and which do not require the exercise of judgment under these guidelines and therefore voted with management for foreign issuers include but are not limited to the following i receiving financial statements or other reports from the board ii approval of declarations of dividends iii appointment of shareholders to sign board meeting minutes iv discharge of management and supervisory boards and v approval of share repurchase programs absent any antitakeover or other concerns mfs will evaluate all other items on proxies for foreign companies in the context of the guidelines described above but will generally vote against an item if there is not sufficient information disclosed in order to make an informed voting decision for any ballot item where mfs wishes to express a more moderate level of concern than a vote of against we will cast a vote to abstain in accordance with local law or business practices some foreign companies or custodians prevent the sale of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting share blocking depending on the country in which a company is domiciled the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior or subsequent to the meeting eg one three or five days or on a date established by the company while practices vary in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date similarly practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the block restriction lifted early eg in some countries shares generally can be unblocked up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the issuers transfer agent due to these restrictions mfs must balance the benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the potentially serious portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility to sell the underlying shares at the most advantageous time for companies in countries with share blocking periods or in markets where some custodians may block shares the disadvantage of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items accordingly mfs will not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual significant vote that outweighs the disadvantage of being unable to sell the stock from time to time governments may impose economic sanctions which may prohibit us from transacting business with certain companies or individuals these sanctions may also prohibit the voting of proxies at certain companies or on certain individuals in such instances mfs will not vote at certain companies or on certain individuals if it determines that doing so is in violation of the sanctions in limited circumstances other market specific impediments to voting shares may limit our ability to cast votes including but not limited to late delivery of proxy materials untimely vote cutoff dates power of attorney and share reregistration requirements or any other unusual voting requirements in these limited instances mfs votes securities on a best efforts basis in the context of the guidelines described above b administrative procedures  mfs proxy voting committee the administration of these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures is overseen by the mfs proxy voting committee which includes senior personnel from the mfs legal and global investment support departments the proxy voting committee does not include individuals whose primary duties relate to client relationship management marketing or sales the mfs proxy voting committee a reviews these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures at least annually and recommends any amendments considered to be necessary or advisable b determines whether any potential material conflict of interest exists with respect to instances in which mfs i seeks to override these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures ii votes on ballot items not governed by these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures iii evaluates an excessive executive compensation issue in relation to the election of directors or iv requests a vote recommendation from an mfs portfolio manager or investment analyst eg mergers and acquisitions and c considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to time  potential conflicts of interest the mfs proxy voting committee is responsible for monitoring potential material conflicts of interest on the part of mfs or its subsidiaries that could arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of mfs clients due to the client focus of our investment management business we believe that the potential for actual material conflict of interest issues is small nonetheless we have developed precautions to assure that all proxy votes are cast in the best longterm economic interest of shareholders other mfs internal policies require all mfs employees to avoid actual and potential conflicts of interests between personal activities and mfs client activities if an employee including investment professionals identifies an actual or potential conflict of interest with respect to any voting decision including the ownership of securities in their individual portfolio then that employee must recuse himselfherself from participating in the voting process any significant attempt by an employee of mfs or its subsidiaries to unduly influence mfs voting on a particular proxy matter should also be reported to the mfs proxy voting committee in cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures no material conflict of interest will be deemed to exist in cases where i mfs is considering overriding these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures ii matters presented for vote are not governed by these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures iii mfs evaluates a potentially excessive executive compensation issue in relation to the election of directors or advisory pay or severance package vote or iv a vote recommendation is requested from an mfs portfolio manager or investment analyst eg mergers and acquisitions collectively nonstandard votes the mfs proxy voting committee will follow these procedures a compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of significant current i distributors of mfs fund shares and ii mfs institutional clients the mfs significant distributor and client list b if the name of the issuer does not appear on the mfs significant distributor and client list then no material conflict of interest will be deemed to exist and the proxy will be voted as otherwise determined by the mfs proxy voting committee c if the name of the issuer appears on the mfs significant distributor and client list then the mfs proxy voting committee will be apprised of that fact and each member of the mfs proxy voting committee will carefully evaluate the proposed vote in order to ensure that the proxy ultimately is voted in what mfs believes to be the best longterm economic interests of mfs clients and not in mfs corporate interests and d for all potential material conflicts of interest identified under clause c above the mfs proxy voting committee will document the name of the issuer the issuers relationship to mfs the analysis of the matters submitted for proxy vote the votes as to be cast and the reasons why the mfs proxy voting committee determined that the votes were cast in the best longterm economic interests of mfs clients and not in mfs corporate interests a copy of the foregoing documentation will be provided to mfs conflicts officer the members of the mfs proxy voting committee are responsible for creating and maintaining the mfs significant distributor and client list in consultation with mfs distribution and institutional business units the mfs significant distributor and client list will be reviewed and updated periodically as appropriate for instances where mfs is evaluating a director nominee who also serves as a director of the mfs funds then the mfs proxy voting committee will adhere to the procedures described in section d above regardless of whether the portfolio company appears on our significant distributor and client list if an mfs client has the right to vote on a matter submitted to shareholders by sun life financial inc or any of its affiliates collectively sun life mfs will cast a vote on behalf of such mfs client pursuant to the recommendations of institutional shareholder services incs iss benchmark policy or as required by law except as described in the mfs funds prospectus from time to time certain mfs funds the top tier fund may own shares of other mfs funds the underlying fund if an underlying fund submits a matter to a shareholder vote the top tier fund will generally vote its shares in the same proportion as the other shareholders of the underlying fund if there are no other shareholders in the underlying fund the top tier fund will vote in what mfs believes to be in the top tier funds best longterm economic interest if an mfs client has the right to vote on a matter submitted to shareholders by a pooled investment vehicle advised by mfs mfs will cast a vote on behalf of such mfs client in the same proportion as the other shareholders of the pooled investment vehicle  gathering proxies most proxies received by mfs and its clients originate at broadridge financial solutions inc broadridge broadridge and other service providers on behalf of custodians send proxy related material to the record holders of the shares beneficially owned by mfs clients usually to the clients proxy voting administrator or less commonly to the client itself this material will include proxy ballots reflecting the shareholdings of funds and of clients on the record dates for such shareholder meetings as well as proxy materials with the issuers explanation of the items to be voted upon mfs on behalf of itself and certain of its clients including the mfs funds has entered into an agreement with an independent proxy administration firm pursuant to which the proxy administration firm performs various proxy vote related administrative services such as vote processing and recordkeeping functions except as noted below the proxy administration firm for mfs and its clients including the mfs funds is iss the proxy administration firm for mfs development funds llc is glass lewis  co inc glass lewis glass lewis and iss are each hereinafter referred to as the proxy administrator the proxy administrator receives proxy statements and proxy ballots directly or indirectly from various custodians logs these materials into its database and matches upcoming meetings with mfs fund and client portfolio holdings which are input into the proxy administrators system by an mfs holdings datafeed through the use of the proxy administrator system ballots and proxy material summaries for all upcoming shareholders meetings are available online to certain mfs employees and members of the mfs proxy voting committee it is the responsibility of the proxy administrator and mfs to monitor the receipt of ballots when proxy ballots and materials for clients are received by the proxy administrator they are input into the proxy administrators online system the proxy administrator then reconciles a list of all mfs accounts that hold shares of a companys stock and the number of shares held on the record date by these accounts with the proxy administrators list of any upcoming shareholders meeting of that company if a proxy ballot has not been received the proxy administrator contacts the custodian requesting the reason as to why a ballot has not been received  analyzing proxies proxies are voted in accordance with these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures the proxy administrator at the prior direction of mfs automatically votes all proxy matters that do not require the particular exercise of discretion or judgment with respect to these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures as determined by mfs with respect to proxy matters that require the particular exercise of discretion or judgment the mfs proxy voting committee or its representatives considers and votes on those proxy matters mfs also receives research and recommendations from the proxy administrator which it may take into account in deciding how to vote mfs uses the research of proxy administrators andor other rd party vendors to identify i circumstances in which a board may have approved excessive executive compensation ii environmental and social proposals that warrant further consideration or iii circumstances in which a nonus company is not in compliance with local governance or compensation best practices in those situations where the only mfs fund that is eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting has glass lewis as its proxy administrator then we will utilize research from glass lewis to identify such issues mfs analyzes such issues independently and does not necessarily vote with the iss or glass lewis recommendations on these issues mfs may also use other research tools in order to identify the circumstances described above representatives of the mfs proxy voting committee review as appropriate votes cast to ensure conformity with these mfs proxy voting policies and procedures as a general matter portfolio managers and investment analysts have little involvement in most votes taken by mfs this is designed to promote consistency in the application of mfs’ voting guidelines to promote consistency in voting on the same or similar issues for the same or for multiple issuers across all client accounts and to minimize the potential that proxy solicitors issuers or third parties might attempt to exert inappropriate influence on the vote for votes that require a casebycase analysis per the mfs proxy policies eg proxy contests potentially excessive executive compensation issues or certain shareholder proposals a representative of mfs proxy voting committee will consult with or seek recommendations from mfs investment analysts andor portfolio managers however the mfs proxy voting committee will ultimately determine the manner in which such proxies are voted as noted above mfs reserves the right to override the guidelines when such an override is in mfs best judgment consistent with the overall principle of voting proxies in the best longterm economic interests of mfs clients any such override of the guidelines shall be analyzed documented and reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies  voting proxies in accordance with its contract with mfs the proxy administrator also generates a variety of reports for the mfs proxy voting committee and makes available online various other types of information so that the mfs proxy voting committee or proxy team may review and monitor the votes cast by the proxy administrator on behalf of mfs clients for those markets that utilize a record date to determine which shareholders are eligible to vote mfs generally will vote all eligible shares pursuant to these guidelines regardless of whether all or a portion of the shares held by our clients have been sold prior to the meeting date  securities lending from time to time the mfs funds or other pooled investment vehicles sponsored by mfs may participate in a securities lending program in the event mfs or its agent receives timely notice of a shareholder meeting for a us security mfs and its agent will attempt to recall any securities on loan before the meetings record date so that mfs will be entitled to vote these shares however there may be instances in which mfs is unable to timely recall securities on loan for a us security in which cases mfs will not be able to vote these shares mfs will report to the appropriate board of the mfs funds those instances in which mfs is not able to timely recall the loaned securities mfs generally does not recall nonus securities on loan because there may be insufficient advance notice of proxy materials record dates or vote cutoff dates to allow mfs to timely recall the shares in certain markets on an automated basis as a result nonus securities that are on loan will not generally be voted if mfs receives timely notice of what mfs determines to be an unusual significant vote for a nonus security whereas mfs shares are on loan and determines that voting is in the best longterm economic interest of shareholders then mfs will attempt to timely recall the loaned shares  engagement   the mfs proxy voting policies and procedures are available on wwwmfscom and may be accessed by both mfs clients and the companies in which mfs clients invest from time to time mfs may determine that it is appropriate and beneficial for representatives from the mfs proxy voting committee to engage in a dialogue or written communication with a company or other shareholders regarding certain matters on the companys proxy statement that are of concern to shareholders including environmental social and governance matters a company or shareholder may also seek to engage with representatives of the mfs proxy voting committee in advance

necessary or advisable other mfs clients mfs may publicly disclose the proxy voting records of certain other clients including certain mfs funds or the votes it casts with respect to certain matters as required by law a report can also be printed by mfs for each client who has requested that mfs furnish a record of votes cast the report specifies the proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the position taken with respect to each issue and upon request may identify situations where mfs did not vote in accordance with the mfs proxy voting policies and procedures except as described above mfs generally will not divulge actual voting practices to any party other than the client or its representatives because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to the client however as noted above mfs may determine that it is appropriate and beneficial to engage in a dialogue with a company regarding certain matters during such dialogue with the company mfs may disclose the vote it intends to cast in order to potentially effect positive change at a company in regards to environmental social or governance issues       for clarification purposes note that mfs votes in what we believe to be the best longterm economic interest of our clients entitled to vote at the shareholder meeting regardless of whether other mfs clients hold short positions in the same issuer  from time to time due to travel schedules and other commitments an appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst may not be available to provide a vote recommendation

considerations the fund may not achieve its objective andor you could lose money on your investment in the fund stock markets and investments in individual stocks are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer market economic industry political regulatory geopolitical and other conditions investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rate environments as the underlying debt instruments in the portfolio adjust to the rise in rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price emerging markets can have less market structure depth and regulatory custodial or operational oversight and greater political social and economic instability than developed markets investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in smallcap companies can be more volatile than investments in larger companies investments in lowerquality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments real estaterelated investments can be volatile because of general regional and local economic conditions fluctuations in interest rates and property tax rates shifts in zoning laws environmental regulation and other governmental actions increased operation expenses lack of availability of mortgage funds losses due to natural disasters changes in property values and rental rates overbuilding losses due to casualty or condemnation cash
