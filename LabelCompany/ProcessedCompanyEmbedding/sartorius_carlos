processing there is high volume for little acknowledgement or reward management which have since left their roles after me were poor communicators and did not listen to recommendations from daytoday interactions ops encounter management was focused on developing metrics to address issues when the foundation of said metrics were inconsistent and poor at best companies were acquired which meant order processing absorbed other job tasks without additional staffing to accompany foreseen company growth sartorius is an excellent stepping stone to a company that values input and employee worth
