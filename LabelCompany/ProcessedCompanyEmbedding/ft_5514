maintenance proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa pnas   rabies is an acute viral infection that is typically fatal most rabies modeling has focused on disease dynamics and control within terrestrial mammals eg raccoons and foxes as such rabies in bats has been largely neglected until recently because bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several emerging zoonotic viruses including sarslike corona viruses henipaviruses and lyssaviruses understanding how pathogens are maintained within a population becomes vital unfortunately little is known about maintenance mechanisms for any pathogen in bat populations we present a mathematical model parameterized with unique data from an extensive study of rabies in a colorado population of big brown bats eptesicus fuscus to elucidate general maintenance mechanisms related projects title completion year investigator ecology of virus transmission in commensal bats  tom oshea see all related projects        tom
