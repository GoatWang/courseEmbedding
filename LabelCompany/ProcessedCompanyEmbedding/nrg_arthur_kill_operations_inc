jose barros plaintiff v arthur kill llc nrg arthur kill operations and consolidated edison of new york defendants arthur kill power llc thirdparty plaintiff v wing environmental inc thirdparty defendant supreme court new york county october   october   paul wooten judge motion sequence numbers  and  are consolidated for purposes of disposition in this action plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages for alleged workplace injuries in motion sequence  defendant consolidated edison of new york inc con ed seeks summary judgment pursuant to cplr  dismissing plaintiffs complaint as well as all crossclaimscounterclaims against it in motion sequence  defendantthirdparty plaintiff nrg energy sha arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations arthur kill seeks  summary judgment against thirdparty defendant wing environmental inc wing for breach of contract for failure to procure insurance and  a declaration that wing is obligated to defend and indemnify nrg in the instant action for the reasons stated below both motions are denied background plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages for an alleged february   workplace accident in which plaintiff an employee of thirdparty defendant wing slipped and fell while performing asbestos abatement at the  victory boulevard staten island new york power plant the premises plaintiff alleges that he slipped and fell on grease that had fallen to the floor of the loading dock area of the power plant specifically in his verified bill of particulars plaintiff maintains the defect or condition which caused the accident consisted of grease which was allowed to accumulate on the flooring of the docks which came from overhead pipes that con edison workers have been working on verified bp a in his complaint plaintiff seeks recovery against con ed and arthur kill based upon negligence wing crossclaims against con ed in its thirdparty answer seeking indemnification and contribution in its answer con ed crossclaims against arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations for commonlaw indemnification further in its thirdparty complaint against wing arthur kill seeks  contractual indemnification and defense in the main action and  commonlaw indemnification and contribution in the main action as well as damages for breach of contract for failure to procure insurance standard to obtain summary judgment dismissing a complaint a movant must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment in its favor as a matter of law see alvarez v prospect hosp  nyd   once this showing has been made the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to establish the existence of material issues of fact that require a trial for resolution giuffrida v citibank corp  nyd    the motion may only be granted where it clearly appears that no material and triable issue of fact is presented because summary judgment is a drastic remedy that should not be invoked where there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue or when an issue is even arguable glick  dolleck v tripac export corp  nyd    see zuckerman v city of new york  nyd    discussion con ed con ed seeks summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs claim of negligence based upon the fact that the property was transferred to nrg in  according to con ed at the time of plaintiffs alleged accident con ed neither owned operated maintained nor controlled the loading dock of the premises however con eds director of real estate candida canizio canizio admitted that after the  sale of the arthur kill plant con ed held easements on the property see canizio ebt at  additionally she attested that she was unaware of the extent of con eds right to control work beyond the easements after the sale id at  finally canizio stated that the sale of arthur kill included licenses to repair operate inspect and replace certain telecommunications equipment and revenue meters as well as maintenance and repair of certain electric feeders and gas supply mains id at  it is not only con eds fee ownership that forms the basis of plaintiffs contentions according to the complaint plaintiff contends that the grease that he slipped on was from overhead pipes that may have been included in the easements for maintenance and repair that were left to con ed after the sale material issues of fact exist as to whether con ed was negligent in the performance of any maintenance or repair on the premises and if so whether such negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiffs alleged accident see burgalassi v mandell mech corp  add  st dept  therefore as to plaintiff that portion of con eds motion is denied additionally con ed seeks dismissal of thirdparty wings crossclaims for indemnification and contribution however because con ed does not address wings crossclaims in any of its supporting papers this court will not treat it separately therefore con eds motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims and all crossclaims and counterclaims is denied arthur kill arthur kill first seeks summary judgment for breach of contract for wings failure to procure insurance for the benefit of arthur kill arthur kill bases its entitlement to such coverage on a purchase requisition attached to its notice of motion as exhibit a exhibit a also contains a document entitled general terms and conditions of purchase order pursuant to a february   decision and order by justice michael d stallman in the related action arthur kill power llc v american cas safety ins co index no  under georgia law the applicable law governing the contract between the parties the general terms and conditions of purchase order is included within the contract between arthur kill and wing the first paragraph of the general terms and conditions of purchase order states the following  acceptance agreement the supplier signing and returning the purchase order acknowledgment the suppliers commencement of performance of the work or shipment of goods subject to the purchase order whichever occurs first shall be deemed an effective acceptance of the purchase order pursuant to that paragraph at the time the work commenced the contract was deemed accepted and that therefore its terms were binding on both parties within the general terms and conditions of the contract paragraph  which deals with insurance states insurance supplier shall purchase and maintain such insurance as will protect supplier and buyer for the losses or claims set forth below which may arise out of or resglt from suppliers performance or obligations to perform under this purchase order whether such performance be by supplier or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by supplier or by anyone whose acts supplier may be liable    a  a    b employers liability el  commercial general liability gl  per occurrence     aggregate many of the arguments proffered in the papers both in this action and the one presided over by justice stallman have focused on the cgl policy and arthur kills status under that policy however the first department has held that any liability that might be assessed against arthur kill as the result of plaintiffs alleged accident arose from the work referred to in the above contract and that therefore arthur kill was an additional insured under wings cgl policy see arthur kill power llc v american cas safety ins co  add  st dept  according to the first department however the cgl policys employers liability exclusion excluded coverage for arthur kill in plaintiffs alleged accident because arthur kills claim for coverage was due to bodily injury of plaintiff arising from and in the course of employment by wing arthur kill power llc  add at  therefore wings cgl insurer was not required to defend or indemnify arthur kill under the cgl policy the question to be determined herein is whether the insurance wing obtained complied with the requirements of the above contract based upon the requirements of paragraph  as quoted above as well as the requirement in paragraph  b the january   decision of the first department and the certificate of insurance dated february   this court holds that the insurance requirements have been satisfied see affirmation in opposition ex a see arthur kill power llc v american cas safety ins co  add   st dept  therefore the portion of arthur kills motion seeking summary judgment for breach of contract based upon wings failure to procure insurance is denied the question that remains is whether arthur kill is entitled to indemnification and defense from wing in the main action under the contract pursuant to paragraph  as stated above the contract was in force at the time of plaintiffs alleged accident pursuant to paragraph  of the contract the indemnity provision the supplier shall defend indemnify and hold buyer and its parent company subsidiaries affiliates divisions and their respective directors officers shareholders employees agents representatives successors and assigns harmless from and against all claims suits or proceedings asserted by a third party or parties and related damages losses and expenses including attorneys fees arising out of or resulting from the suppliers performance or failure to perform under this purchase order this provision clearly spells out wings obligations regarding indemnity and defense and under its terms wing is required to indemnify and defend arthur kill in the main action regardless of the cgl insurers obligations under its policy no mention is made of limitations on defense or indemnification if arthur kill is found to have been negligent in any claim suit or proceeding general obligation law section  declares void agreements purporting to indemnify contractors against liability for injuries contributed to caused by or resulting from their own negligence brown v two exchange plaza partners  add   st dept  affd  nyd   quoting gol  although the general obligations law does permit a partially negligent general contractor to seek contractual indemnification from its subcontractor so long as the indemnification provision does not purport to indemnify the general contractor for its own negligence paragraph  does not contain such savings language brooks v judlau contracting inc  nyd    therefore should arthur kill be found partially negligent paragraph  would be void however should arthur kill be found not to be negligent in this action paragraph  would not violate gol  and its terms would be valid as against wing see minorczyk v dormitory authority of state  add   st dept  a finding of fact has yet to be made regarding arthur kills negligence and as a result this court will not make a declaration of entitlement to defense and indemnification from wing in the main action as such that portion of arthur kills motion that seeks contractual indemnification and defense is denied as premature accordingly it is hereby ordered that motion sequence  consolidated edison of new york incs motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint and any crossclaims and counterclaims asserted against it is denied and it is further ordered that the portion of motion sequence  arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations motion for summary judgment as against thirdparty defendant wing environmental inc is denied and it is further ordered that the portion of motion sequence  arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations motion for a declaratory judgment that thirdparty defendant wing environmental inc must defend and indemnify it is denied as premature this constitutes the decision and order of court footnotes  although the movant in motion sequence  is named nrg energy sha arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations in their answer defendant is denominated as arthur kill power llc and nrg arthur kill operations llc sha nrg arthur kill operations no explanation has been provided for this differencechange  con ed has not been named as a defendant in the thirdparty action  see arthur kill power llc v american cas safety ins co  miscd a sup ct ny county  affd as mod  add  st dept   however as justice stallman previously held to become an additional insured under wings commercial general liability cgl policy the date that the written contract was executed was determinative  in paragraph  b nrg energy inc and buyer shall be added as additional insureds on the gl al automobile liability and umbrella policies for injury or damage resulting from suppliers performance of this purchase order  a certificate of insurance is only evidence of a carriers intent to provide coverage but is not a contract to insure the designated party nor is it conclusive proof standing alone that such a contract exists tribgca broadway assocs llc v mount vernon fire ins co  add   st dept   arthur kill has not proffered any arguments in its motion papers that it is entitled to commonlaw indemnification and contribution and therefore this court does not address it herein comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments
