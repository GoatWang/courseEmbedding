guidance regarding subsequent events which was subsequently updated in february  this guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued in particular this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after june   and was therefore adopted by the company for the quarter ended june   the adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the corporation reports either through recognition or disclosure in the financial statements in february  the fasb amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events alleviating conflicts with current sec guidance this amendment
