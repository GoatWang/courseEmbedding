automotive revenue reached a record level increasing almost  over the previous years and representing  of our annual reven ue   over the past three years diodes has significantly advanced our automotive strategy through investment in new products and customer expansion going forward we expect to further expand revenue growth and to capture additional share through new product introduction and design wins   lastly we end the year with a stronger balance sheet reducing debt by  million generating  million in net cash from operations and returned approximately  of that to our shareholder through the stock buyback we maintained capex at approximately  of the revenue which is at the low end of our  to  model we are continuing to make solid progress on process development at our inch fab in shanghai which we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter    our collective achievements throughout the year position the company for continued growth market share gains and margin expansion as we intend to reach our goal of  billion in annual revenue before turning the call over to rick let me provide an update on our lees summit wafer fab known as kfab as previously announced diodes experienced a fire on november   in the wet etch wafer fabrication area resulting in a temporary suspension of production the cleanup and the repair costs coupling with the fab idling capacity expense in fourth quarter were approximately  million before tax which was partially offset by an initial  million insurance payment   we received the necessary approval on january  and after two qualification normal production resumed on january   we are working diligently to recover those output so that we can fully support our customers requirement in a timely manner im also announce today that after  years the kfab facility lease is not going to be renewed by the landlord at the end of the lease as a result we have begun activities to transfer the wafer manufacturing operation to other internal wafer fabs and external foundries   we expect to cease operation in this third quarter  and to vacate the premise no later than november   employees will be offered retention and the standard severance package setup costs are expected to be approximately  million to  million which will be incurred throughout the remaining of  because of low cost and improved utilization of our internal wafer fabs we expect our annual savings to be  million to  million once the equivalent volume has been fully transferred to other production sites additional detail in the kfab closures are included in our earning press release issued earlier today   with that i now turn the call over to rick to discuss our fourth quarter financial results as well as first quarter guidance in more detail   rick

the pretax closure costs are expected to be  million to  million in  with approximately  million in the first quarter  these shutdown costs have not been included in the above estimates   with that said i will now turn the call over to mark king   mark king  diodes incorporated  svp sales  marketing   thank you rick and good afternoon as rick and dr lu mentioned  was a record year for revenue and gross profit including a breakout year for our automotive strategy reaching  of revenue and growing almost  yearoveryear looking at the fourth quarter specifically revenue was down  sequentially due to typical seasonality compounded by the fire at kfab oem sales were down  while distributor pop was down  we conserved diodes finished goods inventory to support future customer orders due to the fire distributor inventory in the quarter decreased  due to normal reductions while pos was flat   throughout the fourth quarter customer activity remained strong across all regions with solid design activity and design wins with the pericom integration largely complete we are wellpositioned to drive longterm growth with an expanded sales footprint and broadened product line    click to enlarge

  february    pm  gmt diod  q  diodes inc earnings call   turning to global sales asia represented  of revenue europe  and north america  in terms of our end markets consumer represented  of revenue communications  industria l  computing  and automotive was a record  of revenue let me now provide more detail within each of our end markets   for the consumer market we released a new quasiresonant pwm controller with multiple operating modes to maximize power efficiency across a range of load conditions these devices target ac to dc adapters for settop box and gaming console applications also in the portable consumer space our pcie gen  packet switch is ramping up in a wifi speaker application and we have seen increasing contribution from our  watt class d amplifiers for bluetooth speaker applications including a major win from a leading smartphone and consumer electronics manufacturer   in the settop box market specifically we are seeing new market trends for increasing functionality to track usage patterns and strengthen protection against unauthorized content downloads this represents a significant highvolume opportunity for our crystal oscillator line acquired from pericom and we are in the process of being included on a major chinese settop box reference design platform   in the mobile communications market including portable device charging diodes developed and released  volt and  volt tvs devices in close collaboration with leading mobile communications customers which feature industryleading performance we secured an immediate designin for a nextgeneration mobile phone from a major asian manufacturer diodes also launched three more  volt and  volt devices from our new cost performance optimized trench schottky platform which is designed to improve efficiency of budget chargers and adapters using conventional architectures   in the computing market we continue to see acceleration of usb type c adoption across a broad range of computing and portal consumer applications our type c usb mux devices continue to ramp in several marketleading notebook and gaming controller applications as did our sleep and charge port controller in notebook computing also for notebook applications we released a new usb signal multiplexer that enables switching across a wide range of signal types   for the industrial space diodes launched three new secondgeneration highvoltage  volt halfbridge gate drivers for brushless dc motor drive applications also new for q were two additional  volt mosfet products to broaden our existing portfolio based on diodes shielded gate technology additionally we released two new families of led drivers one targeted for industrial applications that operate from a higher input voltage and a second family for dimmable led lamp applications this family of led converters and controllers has met with strong early market adoption securing five significant new design wins for led retrofit bulb applications within the first months of production   we also saw design win strength in security camera and surveillance market with major wins on an omnipolar hall sensor a primary side highfrequency controller a fourport pcie packet switch and an active hdmi switch other notable industrial market wins generated from the metering and industrial control space and finally in the automotive market it was another busy quarter our pcie clock solutions in automotive audio applications continue to ramp while also generating increased activity for our gen  packet switches from a broad range of major automotive module makers we have been receiving strong confirmation on the value of our packet switches from the emerging market requirements for telematics infotainment and adas applications   we also launched a number of new products during the quarter from our mosfet bipolar transistor tvs and sbr platforms diodes expanded our range of high temperature  degree capable mosfets with the addition of two new  volt devices in so packaging for brushless dc motor and other auto applications for the last four quarters now mosfets from diodes innovative automotive qualified shielded gate process have continued to enhance our growing automotive product portfolio mosfet products from this family have accounted for a consistent stream of customer qualification activity and designins across our automotive customer base which has contributed greatly to diodes revenue growth in this end market during    in summary we had a solid year of record revenue gross profit and growth in our automotive market with our acquisition of pericom we are well positioned to capitalize on a number of crossselling opportunities across our expanded product portfolio and global customer base as we look to the coming year we continue to focus on increased content and penetration of several large and growing markets such as automotive wearables internet of things wireless and portable charging as well as usb type c connectors   with that

analyst   it looks like youve reduced pretty nicely channel inventories if we look at your pop versus the pointofsales how much of that was due to the kansas city production disruption and if so would you try to rebuild inventories as production comes back in line later in q and q   mark king  diodes incorporated  svp sales  marketing   i would say that  of that or some percent of that  i dont have it actually quantified to but there was some percentage of it was due to the fire and some of it was generally due to end of the year inventory reductions but we had a little stronger pos than expected in asia so its hard to really quantify all of it yes we do expect to  actually we expect to see a little bit more inventory decrease in this month and through february and maybe start to be able to build again in march and beyond but we still have some restocking that will be required from the fabtech incident   kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   i think our fabtech priority will be supporting the customer on the solesource product and therefore im putting the priority to support the customer demand and sort of build up the inventory in the channel it will be second priority and therefore i probably dont expect that was done in q maybe when we go into the second quarter we have enough capacity then well do that but right now the priority for the kfab is supporting customer demand for the solesource product at the same time start building some inventory prepare for the shutdown those would be the priorities   tristan gerra  robert w baird  company inc  analyst   great and then just a quick followup so presumably your gross margin should benefit as you start rebuilding and im assuming that its more the q type of trend but any comment around that would be great and then also in terms of timings of when the savings begin im assuming its going to be  first half of    kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   well let me answer your first question really the capacity utilization issue other than in the kfab is our assembly site because kfab cannot support enough wafers such that the assembly site production is really sold out so when were talking about utilization cost its really coming from both coming from kfab production and coming from assembly so that is what happened to the first quarter because we basically lose one full month of the wafer output but then when we start to ramp it up and we gradually go back to the run rate before we have a fire and when that happens then the assembly capacity will be start to realize and so i would expect the second quarter  we dont give a guidance yet but i would expect the second quarter our backend utilization to be back to normal   and then to answer your second question  okay you were talking about when benefit would be start to come back and we start to prepare the transfer the technology the process to house our sfab now the one transfer back to  transfer to the ofab some of our technology already existed in ofab and then we transfer the product line to ofab those should be they power this year after the qualification it should recover those but for us to develop the process in the sfab shanghai fab we would expect to gradually qualify some in the second quarter end of second quarter some will be end of third quarter and thats our current schedule   and so i would expect  but this year requirement will try to build inventory from the kfab because it takes time for customers to approve the technology in the shanghai fab so i expect in the first quarter of next year we will start to ramp in our sfab for those products and probably depending on the customer approval time i would expect probably second half of the next year to fully recover   tristan

celentano  raymond james  associates inc  analyst   this is vince celentano on for steve i wanted to followup on the kfab shutdown so should we expect in  and  of there to be maybe a decrease in opex in each year given all the shutdowns as well as the severances   rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   of opex   vince celentano  raymond james  associates inc  analyst   of opex yes   rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   yes i wouldnt think so because most of the kfab expense is in the cost of goods sold area some of it will transfer and be cut down a little bit because of the engineering and those level people but most of their cost is in the overhead line   vince celentano  raymond james  associates inc  analyst   okay great and have you seen any impacts yet from the onfairchild acquisition as far as any particular industry looking now for a second source have you guys seen any  well any impact   mark king  diodes incorporated  svp sales  marketing   i think we see these consolidations whether it be on and fairchild or ir and infineon we see a lot of opportunity from all of those as the vendor base shrinks customers are looking for a new vendor to fill those positions so we view those as both opportunistic situations for us   vince celentano  raymond james  associates inc  analyst   okay great and just one quick followup if i can sneak one in it looks like last quarter your sharebased comp dropped down to about  million do you expect that to return to a more normalized level starting in the march quarter   rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   yes it will that has to do with some changes weve made in the executive compensation and we will  when we do the proxy you will see that we have a new executive compensation which will put us back to a more normal situation   vince celentano  raymond james  associates inc  analyst   okay great thank you   operator   operator instructions shawn harrison longbow research   shawn harrison  longbow research

reduction how would you expect to deploy excess free cash in either in the first quarter or    rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   first quarter of  its going to be debt reduction   shawn harrison  longbow research  analyst   and then whats the decisionmaking process as you move throughout the year between debt pay down versus buyback   rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   well it really ends up being how much money we have available a lot of our money is overseas and its dependent upon the availability of getting that money to the us and so we have a methodology of paying off the debt by not bringing that money back directly to the us so its  if the money is here we can use it for stock buyback if the money is overseas then we have to use it for debt repayment   shawn harrison  longbow research  analyst   okay and then as you bring the inch capacity online  maybe i missed this im sorry  but do costs ramp up as you bring that online exiting the first quarter so there will be an incremental drag as you load that business or is the cost of ramping that already within the guidance here in the first quarter   kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   okay when i say qualify in the first quarter we may not ramp it in the first quarter what im saying expect we build the technology by end of first quarter then we need to get the sample we need to get pcn and we probably wont start to ramp production right away now if we had the loading then it might a little bit hurt but from when we started loading it start to ramp it after you fully ramp it wont cause the problem and were slowly getting the capacity the first chunk of the capacity is  wafers per month its not a big capacity we just carefully develop the technology develop the product the pcn get the customer to accept it   then when the production started and when you fully utilize that capacity then were going to expand that capacity to the next step so you wont see a major cost problem when we ramp up that capacity that capability for longterm its going to be good for us   shawn harrison  longbow research  analyst   perfect and then lastly if i may mark i believe you said asia was a little stronger exiting the year than anticipated was that because of the early chinese new year or are you seeing signs of true underlying demand accelerate in the signs you are seeing from distributors and customers   mark king  diodes incorporated  svp sales  marketing   yes we had a solid fourth quarter with pos in asia as compared to the rest of the world and signs are that going into first quarter and beyond that that business is relatively strong   kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   yes actually right after the chinese new year since the recover  our customers recover is quite strong multiple speakers thats why when we give the guidance we really look at is kfab  actually today our problem is a supply issue not a demand issue as i said our big problem is the kfab wafer support issue and from business point of view if we can get kfab effective production back to normal support we should  it should be looking good    click to enlarge   thomson reuters streetevents

diodes inc earnings call   sha wn harrison  longbow research  analyst   perfect thank you dr lu   operator   lena zhang summit redstone   lena zhang  summit redstone partners  analyst   regarding the kfab transfer process given that there are inch and inch facilities in the kfab and their utilizations you provided on the september quarter and it seems that only the shanghai fab can take all of the products from the kfab so if after you fully shut down the kfab would you please provide us some estimates for the percentage of the outsourcing   mark king  diodes incorporated  svp sales  marketing   i dont think we have exactly those percentages now but i think that the chinese inch fab is not the only opportunity there is some movement around between multiple different products some moving out of our ofab facility into outsource on our sbr products all bipolars really the center of our bipolar technology is located in ofab so the transistors will go there weve had a very long relationship for  years with a japanese supplier and a lot of our products are already qualified in those locations so i dont think everything is required to go there but it definitely will help our utilization in our sfab facility going longterm   kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   and actually we are going to transfer some of the product from our sfab to the sfab to clear some rooms to move the demand from  to move the requirement from kfab to sfab so at the end youre going to have both sfab sfab and including ofab that will all help the utilization so thats why when we put it with  after all these move was completed we should see the benefit of  million to  million thats because the utilization of all of our internal fab will be all helped   lena zhang  summit redstone partners  analyst   thank you and the next one is  yes you did mention cost saving after fully shut down the kfab but this cost savings included negative impact for the increasing of outsourcing   kehshew lu  diodes incorporated  president ceo   i dont know   rick white  diodes incorporated  cfo   well it includes the costs associated so the way that analysis was done is we took the sfab wafers and cost the kfab wafers and cost now and then we said okay what happens when the sfab wafers go up that we go to the outsourcing facility and then we compared the cost after that and thats the  million to  million a quarter that we put in there for  i think we said  million to  million so that includes the cost of those outsourced wafers but in the analysis those outsourced wafers are not as significant as moving the product to sfab   lena zhang  summit redstone partners  analyst   i see but also if i remember correctly last quarter earnings call you mentioned the utilization rate of  is considered as fully utilized right    click to enlarge   thomson reuters streetevents     wwwstreeteventscom      contact us   thomson reuters all rights reserved republication or redistribution of thomson

things in the beginning of last year or  sfab capacity is much bigger and because when we  at that time when we see the demand is not there we actually cut the capacity we return the fourth floor and move out some of the equipment reduce the capacity almost one third to improve the utilization then when we see we are going to  were going to reduce the deals we have a difficulty to renew we actually go back to asking to take the fourth floor that space back and therefore now we have enough space   and after kfab is shut down well move some of the kfab equipment into the sfab therefore when we took inventory in the third quarter that utilization that capacity will be different from the capacity at the end were going to have because we will have more space and we will move the equipment from kfab to sfab   lena zhang  summit redstone partners  analyst   thank you thats very helpful thanks thats all i had   operator   thank you im seeing no other questioners in the queue at
