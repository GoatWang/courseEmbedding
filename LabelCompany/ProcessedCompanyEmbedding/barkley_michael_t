boren by cindy boren june  follow cindyboren charles barkley was everywhere before and during game  of the stanley cup finals on monday night frederick breedongetty images the national broadcasting treasure that is charles barkley turned up at the stanley cup finals on monday night a consequence of his “thank god for the nhl playoffs that’s what i’ve been watching” dig during his regular tnt gig at an undercompetitive nba postseason while his commentary might not have been warmly received in nba and tnt circles it was coolly refreshing for the rest of us barkley who flew to nashville for game  of the predatorspenguins series at the invitation of nhl commissioner gary bettman was all over going from crashing a wayne gretzky news conference to the jumbotron to nbc and the man who threatened to leave game  of the celticscavs series to watch an nhl game even showed up on nbc during a game  intermission it was all good clean well sorta fun too there was a lot to unpack but we learned that barkley remains underwhelmed by the nba postseason is still amazed at the predators’ catfish thing and jeremy roenick the nbc analyst who jumped an alligator a couple of years ago and he continued to declare his love for the nhl at the expense of the league in which he formerly played “i’m just glad to be here because the nba playoffs have not been great” he said during intermission on nbc “but the stanley cup playoffs have been amazing” pictwittercomzekpirhp — nhl on nbc nhlonnbcsports june   gulp reminded by mike milbury of the inconvenient fact that he gets “a paycheck for talking about the nba” barkley was undeterred “first of all they can’t fire me” then he allowed “well they can but then they’ve got to pay me that’s why i signed a longterm deal” harhar sir chuck of the pucks had a little fun with the great one too because this was his playground he interrupted a news conference conversation between gretzky and paul coffey about the  oilers being voted the greatest team in league history to ask gretzky to name his favorite black athlete that would be grant fuhr gretzky’s goalie with the oilers so charles barkley just crashed a wayne gretzkypaul coffey press conference…stanleycup pictwittercomdvprmgg — nhl nhl june   the nhl’s biggest ahem fan promised that he’s going on a diet and added that he would never throw a catfish on the ice as predators fans do because he doesn’t like fish oh and he was rooting for the gator against roenick “i’m one of those people when i see jr who’s a really good friend of mine i sent him a text the other night i thought the catfish thing was amazing but i will say this i’m one of those people i wanted to see the alligator eat his butt one time” barkley’s hockey allegiance has long been a thing dating from the world hockey association’s entry in his home state of alabama to his days in philadelphia when he became friendly with the flyers’ eric lindros and his friendship with espn’s michael wilbon has resulted in trips to watch wilbon’s beloved blackhawks play all that aside it can’t be going over well when he rips the nba’s postseason product “i think we showed a stat we’ve only had four basketball games in the playoffs that were less than double digits” barkley said “so it’s not been a lot of fun broadcasting games this year” but it does pay well sports earlylead get the top olympics news by email major

tweet post email charles barkley explains why michael jordan is no longer his friend by thepostgame staff  share tweet post email charles barkley and michael jordan used to be close friends now jordan wont talk to him can you guess why it turns out barkley was a little too candid in commenting on jordans work in charlotte while the mjowned franchise was in the process of putting up the lowest singleseason win total in nba history barkley took jordan to task for the bad job he had done with the team it doesnt seem like a particularly hostile thing to do  when youre historically bad people tend to point it out but jordan is a sensitive man a highly competitive man and he wasnt handling the thenbobcats losing ways well when he heard barkleys comments he wrote the tnt analyst off i said michael wasnt doing a good job  hes doing a great job now the hornets have gotten better theyve made some great signings  but they werent doing good and i thought he didnt have good people around him barkley says on the seth davis show and i said that because i was asked that question your job is to be an analyst jordan didnt see it that way though he felt betrayed by barkley and lashed out at him with profanitylaced tirades even as barkley explained that he couldnt go on the radio or television and argue that jordan was doing a good job jordan is known as an athlete who likes to surround himself with positive supporters people who challenge or criticize him arent given access to his inner circle barkley may have been one of his best friends during their playing days but he broke the
