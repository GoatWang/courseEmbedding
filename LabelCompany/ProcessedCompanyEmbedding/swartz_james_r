chan w swartz j r     abstract bacterial flagellin has been explored as a potential vaccine adjuvant for enhancing immune responses in this article we describe escherichia colibased cellfree protein synthesis cfps as a method to rapidly produce soluble phase  flagellin flic protein from salmonella typhimurium the yield was about  µgml and the product had much higher affinity for the tlr receptor ec   ±  pm than previously reported the flagellin coding sequence was first optimized for cellfree expression we then found that the d domain at the cterminus of flagellin was susceptible to proteolytic degradation in the cfps system proteolysis was reduced by protease inhibitors the use of proteasedeficient cell extracts or deletion of the flagellin d domain a human tolllike receptor  htlrspecific bioactivity analysis of purified flagellin demonstrated that although the d domain is far from the tlr recognition region it is important for flagellin bioactivity we next incorporated a nonnatural amino acid displaying an alkyne moiety into flagellin using the cfps system and attached flagellin to hepatitis b core viruslike particles vlps using bioorthogonal azidealkyne cycloaddition

abstract we describe a new cellfree protein synthesis cfps method for sitespecific incorporation of nonnatural amino acids nnaas into proteins in which the orthogonal trna otrna and the modified protein ie the protein containing the nnaa are produced simultaneously using this method  mgml of modified soluble superfolder green fluorescent protein sfgfp containing either pazidolphenylalanine pazf or ppropargyloxylphenylalanine ppaf accumulated in the cfps solutions these yields correspond to  suppression efficiency the otrna can be transcribed either from a linearized plasmid or from a crude pcr product comparison of two different otrnas suggests that the new platform is not limited by eftu recognition of the acylated otrna at sufficiently high otrna template concentrations analysis of nnaa incorporation across  different sites in sfgfp suggests that modified protein yields and suppression efficiencies ie the position effect do not correlate with any of the reported trends sites that were ineffectively suppressed with the original otrna were better suppressed with an optimized otrna otrnaopt that was evolved to be better recognized by eftu this new platform can also be used

ptdconjugated proteins to heparan sulfate is an important step in cellular internalization of macromolecules here we studied the pluripotency transcription factor sox with or without the nonaarginine r ptd unexpectedly we observed that sox is strongly adsorbed by heparin and by the fibroblasts without the r ptd however only the rsox fusion protein is internalized by the cells these results

trna and aminoacyltrna synthetase pair biochemical and biophysical research communications albayrak c swartz j r     abstract even though the orthogonal trna and aminoacyltrna synthetase pairs derived from the archaeon methanocaldococcus jannaschii have been used for many years for sitespecific incorporation of nonnatural amino acids nnaas in escherichia coli their kinetic parameters have not been evaluated here we use a cellfree protein synthesis cfps system to control the concentrations of the orthogonal components in order to evaluate their performance while supporting synthesis of modified proteins ie proteins with nnaas titration experiments and estimates of turnover numbers suggest that the orthogonal synthetase is a very slow catalyst when compared to the native e coli synthetases the estimated kcat for the orthogonal synthetase specific to the nnaa ppropargyloxyphenylalanine ppaf is  ×  s thus this catalyst may be the limiting factor for nnaa incorporation when using this approach these titration experiments also resulted in the highest reported cellfree accumulation of two different modified proteins  ±  μgml catpazf and ±μgml sfgfpppaf using the standard kc cell extract and either the panox sp or the inexpensive glu nmp cellfree recipe view details for doi jbbrc view details for web of science id  view details for pubmedid  nuclear resonance vibrational

boyke c a yoda y alp e e zhao j britt r d swartz j r cramer s p     abstract the fefe hydrogenase from clostridium pasteurianum cpi harbors four fes clusters that facilitate the transfer of an electron to the hcluster a ligandcoordinated sixiron prosthetic group that catalyzes the redox interconversion of protons and h here we have used fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy nrvs to study the iron centers in cpi and we compare our data to that for a fes ferredoxin as well as a model complex resembling the feh catalytic domain of the hcluster to enrich the hydrogenase with fe nuclei we used cellfree methods to posttranslationally mature the enzyme specifically inactive cpi apoprotein with felabeled fes clusters was activated in vitro using feenriched maturation proteins this approach enabled us to selectively label the feh subcluster with fe which nrvs confirms by detecting feco and fecn normal modes from the hcluster nonprotein ligands the nrvs and iron quantification results also suggest that the hydrogenase contains a second fes cluster electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy indicates that this feenriched metal center is not the fesh subcluster of the hcluster this finding demonstrates that the cpi hydrogenase retained an feenriched fesh cluster during in vitro maturation providing unambiguous evidence of stepwise assembly of the hcluster in addition this work represents the first nrvs characterization of fefe hydrogenases view details for doi bir view details for web of science id  view details for pubmedid  cellfree production of trimeric influenza hemagglutinin head domain proteins as vaccine antigens biotechnology and bioengineering welsh j p lu y he x greenberg h b swartz j r     abstract in order to effectively combat pandemic influenza threats there is a need for more rapid and robust vaccine production methods in this article we demonstrate e colibased cellfree protein synthesis cfps as a method to rapidly produce domains from the protein hemagglutinin ha which is present on the surface of the influenza virus the portion of the ha coding sequence for the head domain from the  pandemic hn strain was first optimized for e coli expression the protein domain was then produced in cfps reactions and purified in soluble form first as a monomer and then as a trimer by a cterminal addition of the t bacteriophage foldon domain production of soluble trimeric ha head domain was enhanced by introducing stabilizing amino acid mutations to the construct in order to avoid aggregation trimerization was verified using size exclusion hplc and the stabilized ha head domain trimer was more effectively recognized by antibodies from pandemic hn influenza vaccine recipients than was the monomer and also bound to sialic acids more strongly indicating that the trimers are correctly formed and could be potentially effective as vaccines view details for doi bit view details for web of

production using the hcluster an ironsulfur cofactor that contains carbon monoxide co cyanide cn and a dithiolate bridging ligand the hyde hydf and hydg maturases assist in assembling the hcluster and maturing hydrogenases into their catalytically active form characterization of these maturases and in vitro hydrogenase activation methods have helped elucidate steps in the hcluster biosynthetic pathway such as the hydgcatalyzed generation of the co and cn ligands from free tyrosine we have refined our cellfree approach for hcluster synthesis and hydrogenase maturation by using separately expressed and purified hyde hydf and hydg in this report we illustrate how substrates and protein constituents influence hydrogenase activation and for the first time we show that each maturase can function catalytically during the maturation process with precise control over the biomolecular components we also provide evidence for hcluster synthesis in the absence of either hyde or hydf and we further show that hydrogenase activation can occur without exogenous tyrosine given these findings we suggest a new reaction sequence for the fefe hydrogenase maturation pathway in our model hydg independently synthesizes an ironbased compound with co and cn ligands that is a precursor to the hcluster feh subunit and which we have termed hydgco we further propose that hydf is a transferase that stabilizes hydgco and also shuttles the complete feh subcluster to the hydrogenase a translocation process that may be catalyzed by hyde in summary this report describes the first example of reconstructing the fefe hydrogenase maturation pathway using purified maturases and subsequently utilizing this in vitro system to better understand the roles of hyde hydf and hydg view details for

great interest in reprogramming using a safer and more clinically relevant proteinbased approach however the search for an efficient reprogramming approach utilizing the transcription factors in

the apparent affinity of sox and nanog for their consensus sequences to be ± and ±nm respectively in approximate agreement with literature values our assay does not require radioactivity but radioactively labeling the tfs enables the measurement of absolute amounts of immobilized sox and nanog and hence a dnatoprotein binding ratio sox possesses a  dnatoprotein binding ratio whereas nanog

traditional cellfree reactions use a compound with a highenergy phosphate bond such as phosphoenolpyruvate to generate the atp required to drive transcription and translation however recent work has led to better understanding and activation of the complex metabolism that can occur during cellfree reactions we are now able to generate atp using energy sources that are less expensive and more

that also results in highly active cellfree extracts in this work we show that the growth rate of the culture dramatically affects extract performance extracts prepared from cultures with a specific growth rate of h or higher produced approximately  mgml of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cat in a batch reaction in contrast when the source culture growth rate was h the resulting extract produced only  mgml cat examination of the ribosome content in the extracts revealed that the growth rate of the source cells strongly influenced the final ribosome concentration polysome analysis of cellfree protein synthesis reactions indicated that about  of the total s ribosomes are in polysomes for all extracts regardless of growth rate furthermore the overall specific production from the s ribosomes is about  cat proteins per ribosome over the course of the reaction in all cases it appears that rapid culture growth rates are essential for producing a productive extract however growth rate does not seem to influence specific ribosome activity rather the increase in extract productivity is a result of a higher ribosome concentration these results are important for cellfree

quantitative polysome profile analysis was used to characterize cellfree translation thereby elucidating many kinetic parameters the ribosome concentration in escherichia colibased cfps reactions was

identified elongation as the major limitation adding purified elongation factors efs to cfps reactions increased the ribosome elongation rate and protein synthesis rates and yields as well as the translation initiation rate indicating a possible coupling between initiation and elongation further examination of translation initiation in the cellfree system showed that the first initiation on an

following chemical mutagenesis a total of eight e coli mutants exhibiting significantly higher disulfide isomerization activity not only with vtpa but also with two other unrelated protein substrates were isolated this phenotype resulted from significantly increased expression of the bacterial disulfide isomerase dsbc in seven of the eight mutants the upregulation of dsbc was found to be related to defects in rna processing by rnase e the rne gene product specifically the genetic lesions in five mutants were shown to be allelic to rne while an additional two mutants exhibited impaired rnase e activity due to lesions in other loci the importance of mrna stability on the expression of dsbc is underscored by the short halflife of the dsbc transcript which was found to be only  min at  degrees

because pyruvate and glucosephosphate are the first and last intermediates of the glycolytic pathway respectively the results also suggest the possibility of using any glycolytic intermediate or even

central dipeptides of dsba and dsbc in disulfide bond formation and isomerization in the escherichia coli periplasm dsba activesite mutants with a wide range of redox potentials were expressed either from the trc promoter on a multicopy plasmid or from the endogenous dsba promoter by integration of the respective alleles into the bacterial chromosome the dsba alleles gave significant differences in the yield of active murine urokinase a protein containing  disulfides including some that significantly enhanced urokinase expression over that allowed by wildtype dsba no direct correlation between the in vitro redox potential of dsba variants and the urokinase yield was observed these results suggest that the activesite cxxc motif of dsba can play an important role in determining the folding of multidisulfide proteins in a way that is independent from dsbas redox potential however under aerobic conditions there was no significant difference among the dsba mutants with respect to phenotypes depending on the oxidation of proteins with few disulfide bonds the effect of activesite mutations in the cxxc motif of dsbc on disulfide isomerization in vivo was also examined a library of dsbc expression plasmids with the activesite dipeptide randomized was screened for mutants that have increased disulfide isomerization activity a number of dsbc mutants that showed enhanced expression of a variant of human tissue plasminogen activator as well as mouse urokinase were obtained these dsbc mutants overwhelmingly contained an aromatic residue at the cterminal position of the dipeptide whereas the nterminal residue was more diverse collectively these data indicate that the active sites of the soluble thiol disulfide oxidoreductases can be modulated to enhance disulfide

developed to prolong the synthesis and also to avoid the accumulation of inorganic phosphate this approach was demonstrated in a batch system derived from escherichia coli contrary to the conventional methods in which exogenous energy sources contain highenergy phosphate bonds the new system was designed to generate continuously the required highenergy phosphate bonds within the reaction mixture thereby recycling the phosphate released during protein synthesis if allowed to accumulate phosphate inhibits protein synthesis most likely by reducing the concentration of free magnesium ion pediococcus sp pyruvate oxidase when introduced in the reaction mixture along with thiamine pyrophosphate tpp and flavin adenine dinucleotide fad catalyzed the generation of acetyl phosphate from pyruvate and inorganic phosphate acetyl kinase already present with sufficient activity in escherichia coli s extract then catalyzed the regeneration of atp oxygen is required for the generation of acetyl phosphate and the ho produced as a byproduct is sufficiently degraded by endogenous catalase activity through the continuous supply of chemical energy and also through the prevention of inorganic phosphate accumulation the duration of protein synthesis is extended up to  h protein accumulation levels also increase the synthesis of human lymphotoxin receives greater benefit than than that of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase because the former is more sensitive to phosphate inhibition finally through repeated addition of pyruvate and amino acids during the reaction period protein

vitro hydrogenase activation methods have helped elucidate steps in the hcluster biosynthetic pathway such as the hydgcatalyzed generation of the co and cn ligands from free tyrosine we have refined our cellfree approach for hcluster synthesis and hydrogenase maturation by using separately expressed and purified hyde hydf and hydg in this report we illustrate how substrates and protein constituents influence hydrogenase activation and for the first time we show that each maturase can function catalytically during the maturation process with precise control over the biomolecular components we also provide evidence for hcluster synthesis in the absence of either hyde or hydf and we further show that hydrogenase activation can occur without exogenous tyrosine given these findings we suggest a new reaction sequence for the fefe hydrogenase maturation pathway in our model hydg independently synthesizes an ironbased compound with co and cn ligands that is a precursor to the hcluster feh subunit and which we have termed hydgco we further propose that hydf is a transferase that stabilizes hydgco and also shuttles the complete feh subcluster to the hydrogenase a

growth rate of h or higher produced approximately  mgml of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cat in a batch reaction in contrast when the source culture growth rate was h the resulting extract produced only  mgml cat examination of the ribosome content in the extracts revealed that the growth rate of the source cells strongly influenced the final ribosome concentration polysome analysis of cellfree protein synthesis reactions indicated that about  of the total s ribosomes are in polysomes for all extracts regardless of growth rate furthermore the overall specific production from the s ribosomes is about  cat proteins per ribosome over the course of the reaction in all cases it appears that rapid culture growth rates are essential for producing a productive extract however growth rate does not seem to influence specific ribosome activity rather the increase in extract productivity is a result of a higher ribosome concentration these results are important for cellfree

accumulation or activity although the efficiency of iron and cysteine utilization increased fd maturation was independent of protein production rate and proceeded at a constant rate throughout the

identified elongation as the major limitation adding purified elongation factors efs to cfps reactions increased the ribosome elongation rate and protein synthesis rates and yields as well as the translation initiation rate indicating a possible coupling between initiation and elongation further examination of translation initiation in the cellfree system showed that the first initiation on an

mainly because of high reagent costs and a lack of scalable technologies here we address the first issue by presenting a cellfree protein synthesis system with comparable protein yields that removes

following chemical mutagenesis a total of eight e coli mutants exhibiting significantly higher disulfide isomerization activity not only with vtpa but also with two other unrelated protein substrates were isolated this phenotype resulted from significantly increased expression of the bacterial disulfide isomerase dsbc in seven of the eight mutants the upregulation of dsbc was found to be related to defects in rna processing by rnase e the rne gene product specifically the genetic lesions in five mutants were shown to be allelic to rne while an additional two mutants exhibited impaired rnase e activity due to lesions in other loci the importance of mrna stability on the expression of dsbc is underscored by the short halflife of the dsbc transcript which was found to be only  min at  degrees

expression of a variant of human tissue plasminogen activator as well as mouse urokinase were obtained these dsbc mutants overwhelmingly contained an aromatic residue at the cterminal position of the dipeptide whereas the nterminal residue was more diverse collectively these data indicate that the active sites of the soluble thiol disulfide oxidoreductases can be modulated to enhance disulfide

biotechnology progress kim d m swartz j r     abstract factors causing the early cessation of protein synthesis have been studied in a cellfree system from escherichia coli we discovered that phosphoenol pyruvate pep the secondary energy source for atp regeneration and several amino acids are rapidly degraded during the cellfree protein synthesis reaction the degradation of such compounds takes place even in the absence of protein synthesis this degradation severely reduces the capacity for protein synthesis the lost potency was completely recovered when the reaction mixture was supplied with additional pep and amino acids of the  amino acids only arginine cysteine and tryptophan were required to restore system activity through repeated additions of pep arginine cysteineand tryptophan the duration of protein synthesis was greatly extended in this fedbatch reaction after a  h incubation the level of cellfree synthesized chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cat reached  microgml which is  times the yield of the batch reaction addition of fresh magnesium further extended the protein synthesis as a result through coordinated additions of pep arginine cysteine tryptophan and magnesium the final concentration of cellfree synthesized cat increased more than fold compared to a batch reaction sdspage analysis of such a fedbatch reaction produced an obvious band

a novel atp regeneration system biotechnology and bioengineering kim d m swartz j r     abstract a new approach for the regeneration of adenosine triphosphate atp during cellfree protein synthesis was developed to prolong the synthesis and also to avoid the accumulation of inorganic phosphate this approach was demonstrated in a batch system derived from escherichia coli contrary to the conventional methods in which exogenous energy sources contain highenergy phosphate bonds the new system was designed to generate continuously the required highenergy phosphate bonds within the reaction mixture thereby recycling the phosphate released during protein synthesis if allowed to accumulate phosphate inhibits protein synthesis most likely by reducing the concentration of free magnesium ion pediococcus sp pyruvate oxidase when introduced in the reaction mixture along with thiamine pyrophosphate tpp and flavin adenine dinucleotide fad catalyzed the generation of acetyl phosphate from pyruvate and inorganic phosphate acetyl kinase already present with sufficient activity in escherichia coli s extract then catalyzed the regeneration of atp oxygen is required for the generation of acetyl phosphate and the ho produced as a byproduct is sufficiently degraded by endogenous catalase activity through the continuous supply of chemical energy and also through the prevention of inorganic phosphate accumulation the duration of protein synthesis is extended up to  h protein accumulation levels also increase the synthesis of human lymphotoxin receives greater benefit than than that of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase because the former is more sensitive to phosphate inhibition finally through repeated addition of pyruvate and amino acids during the reaction period protein synthesis continued for  h in the new system resulting in a final yield of  mgml view details for web of science id  view details for pubmedid  cellfree protein synthesis new analyses new efficiencies

endowment  susan shallcross swartz photograph by clay blackmore harvard divinity school hds today announced that artist and activist susan shallcross swartz and her husband james r swartz  ’ have donated  million to establish the susan shallcross swartz endowment for christian studies in support of new professorships fellowships and educational programs the gift is reportedly among the largest in the school’s history susan swartz became hds’s first artist in residence in  she subsequently served on the dean’s council and the gift is intended in part to honor the legacy of william a graham who stepped down as dean last june read grahams review of an exhibition of her work here in the announcement susan swartz said from the beginning of my association with hds i was impressed with the leadership of bill graham and with the dean’s council’s commitment to keeping the oldest divinity school in the country a vibrant place of scholarship and reflection this gift will allow dean david n hempton to take the school into the future and to improve the currency of the leadership that hds exercises my hope is that the endowment will inspire scholarship and reinvigorate debate service and teaching for generations to come hempton said “susan and jim’s extraordinary gift will advance teaching and research in christianity one of our core strengths well into the future” president drew faust said “the divinity school plays a key role in the work and mission of the wider university and susan and jim’s gift…helps solidify the study of religion’s place at harvard we are most grateful” susan swartz is on the boards of the utah film center and the fine arts museums of san francisco and on the national advisory board of the national museum of women in the arts she cofounded the christian center of park city and is a founding member of impact partners a documentaryfilm organization her artistic work and social engagements are described on her website she and her husband live

breyer is a partner of the same firm his accel biography which details some of his more than  corporate directorships and lead technology investments also describes interests ranging from chairing the swartz foundation and the park city christian center to serving as director emeritus of the us ski and snowboard foundation and trustee of the san francisco museum of modern art on which board breyer also serves he is a member of the board of advisers of tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university where he earned an ms in industrial administration and has created an entrepreneurial
