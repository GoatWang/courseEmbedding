uncharted territory” she says “for example moving to taiwan at  and then china to study mandarin was uncommon for americans in  additionally joining a law firm with only three women partners and then leaving that successful practice and partnership after  years to join accenture were also unexpected choices taking risks and succeeding at each stage of my career has given me the confidence to seek the next opportunity” previously general counsel secretary and chief compliance officer and a member of accenture’s global management committee julie made a significant contribution to the company’s

governments the company has approximately  people serving clients in more than  countries when this opportunity presented itself what made you feel it would be the right fit three reasons come immediately to mind first was accenture’s truly global footprint while i did a lot of international work during my years practicing law every day at accenture i work on issues in different parts of the world and across multiple countries and cultures i’m also excited by our push to expand into emerging markets second it was about the people accenture people are extremely smart and really care about each other with our top  leaders located across the world we enjoy tremendous diversity in thinking and perspective which ultimately helps us deliver results and makes this a great place to work the third piece for me was the role of the general counsel at accenture which is at the heart of the business when i interviewed our former ceo and now executive chairman bill green said that he was looking for my business judgment not just my legal advice that was important because it was how i had always approached my practice being able to help grow and protect a business was attractive to me and accenture has a management team that sees the general counsel in that role how do you define your role with accenture part of the role is supporting the board and corporate governance another significant aspect is leading a global team that provides the legal support to help drive our business as part of this i focus on attracting and retaining the best talent because that kind of talent is critical to supporting  billion in revenue another component is risk management which isn’t about saying “no” it’s about understanding what we want to achieve and the risks involved and then helping to make decisions about how we’re going to meet those objectives and balance risk because you can’t grow without taking risk a lot of what i do is help the business make good decisions about smart risk that might include putting in preventive measures like the right compliance programs or helping make decisions about how we’ll adapt to doing business in an emerging market where you face different contract terms and expectations has the public dialogue on compliance been effective or does there need to be more change in terms of regulation the challenges that continue to plague even wellregulated markets are in the news every day i believe the focus needs to be on smart regulation based on a deep understanding by the government of both the businesses they are regulating and the actual dynamics of the marketplace keep in mind that regulation also creates a public dialogue around an issue sometimes the dialogue itself has value keeping important issues on the front page is it tough to describe what makes accenture different not at all of the top  leaders all but four of us have been with the company  years or more something keeps people here beyond just needing a paycheck and i think it comes down to our collegial collaborative culture we have an amazing ability to team across geographies cultures and workforces to deliver the best solutions to our clients we also have the best people in the business and to ensure that they have necessary skills to serve clients and advance in their own careers we invest significantly in their training and professional development in fact we invested more than  million in training last year – that’s why we’re different what is the value of cultural diversity within the firm we look at diversity through the widest possible lens we capitalize on the diversity of our workforce across countries cultures generations and a broad mix of education experiences and backgrounds giving our clients access to a rich range of talent at the same time we understand that achieving success is a constant journey for example we have  women which is terrific but we know there is more to do our top leadership is directly engaged to ensure that we raise the bar on diversity in bringing talent in what makes for the right fit the ticket to the show starts with a strong skill set but that is only the beginning a person’s leadership ability is critical in legal we particularly look for three leadership qualities understanding what integrity means the ability to show empathy because you need to understand the other point of view in order to be a better lawyer and communicate hard messages and demonstrating the courage to deliver those hard messages for me it’s also about being willing to challenge yourself and your thinking no one on my leadership team sits on the sidelines regardless of whether it’s your specialty or not everyone is empowered to participate we make decisions as a leadership team in an atmosphere where people have
