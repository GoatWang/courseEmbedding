erin and matts wedding love  lavender bridal guides news reviews  roundups erin and matt’s wedding last updated july th  california real weddings vintage  comments erin and matt had a really amazing wedding day we love their personalized details–sunglasses cassette tapes records—all made their wedding that much more special here is what erin had to say about her special day “everything was really based on the feel of my dress romantic a touch of vintage and really just things that we both really liked we were also planning all details from new york where we live and we didn’t want to hire a florist so the look and feel all really came from things we could really do ourselves with friends and family” “matt is a musician and i really wanted to be sure he had input into the details he had some great ideas like the little ” records as table stands and cassette tapes as escort cards we bought them on ebay and could tailor the tape to the person his dad got pink floyd’s the wall and one of my bff’s got the breakfast club soundtrack everyone got to keep their tape we also put matching sunglasses on each of the guests’ seats so the crowd had matching shades in our postceremony group shot” advice for future brides “i was dedicated to making things fun and really tried to let go of details that weren’t going to make or break the day it’s possible that a bride could spend days and a lot of money on details that the guests would never notice i stuck to my goals and had an amazing time have a cute outfit a yummy dinner and an awesome dance party also try and implement details that will matter to your husbandtobe it’s his day too” disclosure this post may contain affiliate links which means if you click on the link and make a purchase i will receive a small commission i may be
