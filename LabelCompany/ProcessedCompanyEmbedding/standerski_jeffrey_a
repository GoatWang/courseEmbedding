arinc urgentlink command  control systems cybersecurity public safety systems jeff standerski executive profiles learn how a fascination with airplanes and advice from his grandfather helped shape jeff standerski’s career jeff standerski’s passion for aviation began during his childhood when he would gaze at the airplanes taking off and landing at the airport near his home in the south suburban chicago town of calumet city – a blue collar community located along the western shorelines of lake michigan it’s a passion that continued well into standerski’s adolescence and one that ultimately sparked an interest in avionics engineering and a career with rockwell collins that has spanned more than  years “as a teenager i spent my summers pumping gas at the local airport and i was always looking up in the sky” recalled standerski now senior vice president of information management services ims at rockwell collins “i was fascinated with airplanes” with his heart set on becoming a commercial aviation pilot standerski entered parks college of saint louis university where he earned a degree in aeronautics and avionics during college he also received his pilot’s license and instrument rating but somewhere along the way he realized that wasn’t the kind of longterm career he desired instead he interviewed with several aerospace and defense companies – including lockheed martin mcdonnell douglas and rockwell collins – and ultimately decided to begin his career as a systems engineer at our company headquartered in cedar rapids iowa “there were several parks college graduates who had joined rockwell  collins before me and they were always talking about what a great company it was” said standerski whose first assignment found him working on the german air force c60 transall aircraft “when i came to cedar rapids i knew right away that it was the right place for me” he continued “i felt very confident that the leader hiring me was going to help me transition into the workforce and also help me professionally and personally in the end i was right” career takes flightduring the next  years standerski began to carve out a name for himself within government systems as a marketing support specialist programs manager programs director and senior director of advanced communications and technology it was during those early years that he discovered the importance of mentoring and longterm career planning he also found himself “hooked on the customer” which he said was extremely beneficial upon his transition into commercial systems in 00 “as much as i enjoyed the technical nature of what we do i really enjoyed working with customers” said standerski who also held the roles of vice president of strategy development for commercial systems vice president and general manager of air transport systems and vice president and general manager of business and regional systems “the mentors i’ve had over the years have always reminded me that we are first and foremost an engineering company” he continued “we build innovative products and solutions we support our customers we meet our commitments” learning a new businesstoday standerski is the leader of our newly created ims business which is based in annapolis maryland it’s a position he was appointed to by ceo and president kelly ortberg in january 0 following the december  acquisition of arinc incorporated which is now the core of our ims business like most corporate executives standerski admits his plate is overflowing he’s learning the ins and outs of a new business that provides communications systems integration and security solutions across the aviation airport rail and nuclear power markets he now has responsibility for about 00 employees and he’s familiarizing himself with new customers and a new community but despite his hectic schedule – which includes frequent business travel to various locations around the world – standerski remains committed to preserving the leadership style he learned from the man who hired him into the company more than two decades ago he’s also dedicated to maintaining the humility loyalty and work ethic he learned from his maternal grandfather “my first engineering leader was an individual who truly cared about people both from a professional and personal growth perspective” said standerski “he had an open door policy and was very approachable and that’s something i’ve tried to emulate over the years “i also owe a great deal to my grandfather” he continued “i spent a lot of time with him when i was growing up and he taught me the importance of loyalty and the importance of working hard and always trying to go above and beyond what’s expected of you” leading by examplethose are lessons and traits that standerski and his wife mary beth have worked to instill in their own three children samantha matthew and katie in fact standerski has always tried to lead by example and that begins with maintaining an appropriate worklife balance while each leadership position has required a great deal of business travel standerski has always found a way to stay engaged with what’s going on at home “the kids were raised with me traveling a lot so they are somewhat accustomed to that” he said “but technology is an amazing thing if i’m not home to hug or kiss them goodnight we make sure we talk via facetime or skype that allows me to still see their emotions and remain engaged in their lives” in november 0 standerski and his wife will celebrate their rd wedding anniversary while the couple is looking forward to discovering life together on the east coast the memory of how their married life began always prompts a laugh “when i proposed to mary beth she told me that she would marry me if i promised to move back to chicagoland in a couple of years” he said laughing “of course i agreed and we’ve been married for more than  years – all in cedar rapids until now “she has made a lot of sacrifices over the years but she’s done a wonderful job with our family and has been incredibly supportive of me” continued standerski “i wouldn’t be where i am today without her” corporate bio jeff standerski
