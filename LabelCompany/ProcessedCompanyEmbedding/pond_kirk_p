took fairchild semiconductor international inc out in a leveraged buyout from national semiconductor corp in  pond  stated his intentions to build a company that serves a variety of markets with highperformance building block productslowpriced logic analog and discrete semiconductors ponds strategy had three elements develop a lot of products fast build an efficient costeffective and global manufacturing infrastructure and deliver superior customer service he hasnt deviated one millimeter from that in three years since  when fairchilds quarterly run rate was roughly  million pond boosted revenue threefold to  million in the third quarter and is projecting fourthquarter revenue of  million that represents about  of the total available market according to fairchild operating margins are in the  range which is comparable to companies serving the more glamorous sectors of the semiconductor market and gross margins are close to  thanks in part to a slew of new products that characteristically command higher prices fairchild introduces about  products a quarter which account for about  of revenue the target is to up that to  in the next year or so pond has accomplished these results through a combination of organic growth and acquisition to date fairchild has acquired five businesses including three that were carveouts of large companies case in point was the  acquisition of samsungs power devices division for  million while the unit was an important captive supplier for samsung it was not a strategic business for the company to beef up customer service fairchild has spent  million in the past two years putting in a peoplesoft system to replace the myriad legacy systems it inherited from national and fairchild continues to spend  to  of its revenue on globalizing its erp systems as for manufacturing operations pond reorganized the company at the beginning of the year to set up a global operations organization alongside the six product groups the reason was to create more flexible global manufacturing and develop common processes for fairchilds factories it made sense to group all our operations activities together and have our product divisions responsible for the development of new products product marketing and the management of pls pond said in short pond has done what he said he would do build a viable business financial and market analysts give fairchild high marks particularly for integrating its acquisitions pond really understands the market said jim feldhan president of semico research corp phoenix hes a real downtoearth kind of guy which is refreshing to see in a ceo indeed pond is the antithesis of the fasttalking highrolling silicon valley chief executive hes a lowkey straightshooting leader whos active in his church and likes gardening and spending time with his family hes also an actionmovie buff the lower the rating the better he quipped pond recently caught the th day the latest arnold schwarzenegger film i wasnt able to make the  oclock showing but i made the  oclock on friday afternoon he said his other passion annihilating mosquitoes southern maine where fairchild is headquartered is a notorious breeding ground for mosquitoes and pond has spent an inordinate amount of his free time scheming to rid his yard of the pests his most recent acquisition was a barbecuesize unit that emits a cloud of carbon dioxide that attracts the females and vacuums them into a bag for convenient disposal one ounce is about  dehydrated mosquitoes pond said his singleminded attitude toward killing mosquitoes is exceeded only by his zealousness for building his company i have a reputation at fairchild for absolutely never being satisfied with anything pond said i have the view that we have so much to do there isnt a single moment that we dont need to be improving on something so get ready for phase two of fairchilds master plan ponds goal is to own  market share of the buildingblock business within the next few years that means doubling the companys revenue to between  billion and  billion while maintaining the same healthy operating margin in this  billion to  billion space during the next few years only a couplemaybe only one billion to  billion players will emerge i intend for fairchild to be one of those companies email thisprintcomment
