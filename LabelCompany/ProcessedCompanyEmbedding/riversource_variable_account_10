concerns all they want is your money and once they have it they will delay impede and keep your money no matter the documents youre requested to send or any other information which other reputable companies will honor dont use this company they are a scam commented on   est i chose to relocate an inherited ira rather than leave it with riversource before i read these reviews cant get away from them fast enough like the other trustees mentioned riversource was not helpful when it came to moving funds to another investment company the medallion signature on my form was not honored the letter of acceptance from the receiving firm was provided but ignored or overlooked an account number for the transfer was provided letters of instructions were requested even though instructions were indicated on their own forms the form they sent was not sufficient so a new form package was sent to be filled outthat is the readers digest version of my experience hard to believe the request letters for additional information are not automatically generated monthly just to stall the process you do not have a dedicated processing agent to handle your claim call the  number and good luck the poor rep on the other end of the phone has no control to help you they only repeat the problem the claims department reports they can see the history we are starting our th month now and confirm the documents have been received will update this if possible do not let your financial planner put your funds in this scary place commented on   est aboslutely horrible untrustworthy and shady they ask for original documents  no trustworthy company ever asks for originals  and then they lose them i believe this is a scam to prevent them paying any claim or they are just very negligent the way they deal with survivors of deceased relatives is abominable i would never trust my property let alone my life to them ever if there were a negative rating they would get a  from me commented on   est riversource a division of ameriprise is a horrible company to deal with my brother had an annuity with them of which i was a beneficiary after my brothers death riversource refused to provide a copy of the annuity contract for  months when it finally arrived i learned there was a rider on the contract that charged  a year the rider was to terminate on my brothers death but riversource has taken out over  in rider fees i believe they delayed providing me the information so they could charge these fees they also provide statements with contradictory information on the balance of the accountsdifferences from one page to another were as high as  a month they never offered an explanation of the different figures three letters to vice president iachello went unanswered i could go on but these people are ripoff artists and should be avoided if you are filing a claim get everything in writing and start filing complaints with your state insurance commission the moment they start their delays commented on   est i paid disability income premiums for  years and filed a claim in december of  the experience has been horrible with their clear intent not to pay the claimmeanwhile i go broke commented on   est i have had a life insurance policy on my mother for many years but now have been told the policy will lapsemy premiums went from  per month to over  per monthi have asked for a full illustration of the policy to see future premium increasesi have been promised  times i will get one but get a letter every time the policy is in danger of lapsing even though i pay the premium bills i am sent i cannot get the illustration so i can decide if this policy is worth havingjust a big run around i pay up policy but by the time i do i am already behind againreally dont know what to do anymorethese people should be banned from doing business in ohio commented on   est my father inlaw has paid premiums for long term care to riversource insurance for years he had to apply for his first claim in  at the age of  we have had nothing but problems riversource is so far behind in paying his claims that we just had to cancel  hours of his  hour care because we cant afford to pay for it this companys long term care is a scam we send all the paperwork were supposed to and they pick and choose what they pay for with no explanation when i call to find out whats going on i get the runaround every time i am exhausted after ten months of this buyer beware this company is a scam commented on   est great service commented on   est i was just advised that my river source life insurance policy will lapsethey are stating that the investments are not making enough money to sustain the death benefit so to remedy that i need to come up with over  now so it does not lapse and my premium will rise from  every  months to  every  months stay as far away from this company as you canyou are lured in by the low premiums and then after they have you a few years they pull this trick on you my ameriprise financial adviser was the one who sold me on the policy and i thought it would be a great addition to our portfolio to help protect my family well that turned out to be wrong and feel ameriprise failed me they waited to the last minute to inform me that the insurance was lapsing they know the game and play right along with it i should have been informed earlier to help avoid this situation and make different investments to keep the policy affordable and not lapse this way they can get you to buy something else to replace the policy you thought they were watch for you i should know better and should a keep a closer eye on my investments i thought i could trust ameriprise to do that for me commented on   est we are going to file a formal complaint because they never explained the policy and we had to allow it to lapse after  years and an investment of over  they cleaned out the account and we were left with nothing commented on   est my advisor put me in riversource annuities i wanted to leave ameriprise but found out the annuities had to stay the fees are so high annually i decided to surrender them now i have a surrender fee huge and prorata rider fees and a  contract fee these are vampires and fee hogs stay away look up greed in the dictionary you will find riversource there never buy an annuity from these folks commented on   est my aunt passed away several months ago and i have been trying to make a beneficiary claim since you are clearly calling off shore talking with folks that have made up names who cant call out faxes have been lost not imaged or never received phone calls go to voice mail and then die stay away commented on   est earlier this year my sister and i lost our mother to pancreatic cancer among her investments was one with riversource we were both given an equal amount of the money mom had with them substantial and both filled out separate paper work the only option available to us to get our funds was a check mailed to each of us about  days later props to them for processing this in a timely manner my sister receives a check and deposits it the next business day she receives another check for a slightly different amount some taxes withheld on this one and calls them up to ask what is going on long story short riversource sent both my sisters funds and my funds to her in checks both made out to my sister we have both been on the phone mostly on hold with them over the past few days trying to get this resolved we both requested that my sister simply wire me the funds but riversource refuses they told me that she should expect a call telling her how to return the funds by a check in the mail they wrongly sent to her soon once that check gets to them and they then process it they will send out another check presumably to me this timenow to me there has been several mistakes that riversource has mademistake  sending funds through regular mailmistake  sending my funds to the wrong personmistake  refusing payment to me until the person they sent the funds to returns themin this case it should all work out as i trust my sister completely and know she will return the funds my question is though and i asked them this what would have happened if it wasnt my sister who got the funds they never answered but my guess is that i would never get the funds legally due meto me a financial firm should just not mess things up this badly and i for one would never trust riversource with my money after the experience i had commented on   est after filling out the paperwork and suppling the mandated documentation i got a call saying that they did not receive the death certificate i wonder what they plan on doing with the one i sent they keep insisting i send them another one like they grow on trees or something commented on   est i have been trying to move my riversource variable annuity funds with ameriprise to vanguard i have submitted all of the appropriate forms with the medallion guarantee signature to vanguard and they have requested the funds which continue to sit in my ameriprise account which is slowly being siphoned of funds probably will have to take legal action stay away from both ameriprise and riversource anything commented on   est my father had his retirement invested with this firm he died in january and left all to my mom as beneficiary we completed all the required paper work and submitted the death claim benefit to transfer to her and so that she would continue to receive monthly disbursements we were told it would take  business days it has now been over two months and we have not heard nor received anything we are told that they have a computer problem and it keeps throwing my moms name out and they cannot process it we cannot get her money which she needs to live we have called everyday and are told they will fix it today everyday we are told the same thing its a computer problem now they put us on hold when we call weve been on hold now for  minutes they are basically keeping her money which i consider stealing looks like our only resource is to hire an attorney stay away from this company  commented on   est i have been trying to transfer my account to fidelity for  years they throw red tape and refuse to transfer the funds commented on   est was sold with a  guaranteed base rate now company is reneging on agreement commented on   est i was told several years ago that i had to buy life insurance with my investment portfolio i have no trust for my adviser who thinks i should be happy because my investments are following the stock market other investments the company flaunts have x the return over mine in the last  years  commented on   est beware of their stiff penalties for early withdrawl i was not made aware by my ameriprise advisor  commented on   est purchased term life  yrs ago wmonthly pmts of  auto deducted from my checking acct through our financial planner for the last two years our financial planner has left ameriprise replacement cfp has never contacted us no longer get paper statements from ameriprise no access through internet and never had any correspondence from riversourse company started deducting  four months ago before i noticed changed in premium and company refuses to refund we have never received any correspondence from them for ten years and amazingly they have a copy of notice we never received regarding change in premiums and they should not be allowed to change auto payment amounts without policy holders signature commented on   est i have  life insurance policies and a disability insurance policy im on disability now and its a fight every month to get my check they delay payment and i have to hound the claims analyst to call back answer questions etc commented on   est impossible to deal with customer disservice people are all from philippines if you get an american they refuse to transfer to ceo or executive they are rude condescending and insulting  and theyre this way with people with lots of money in their funds how stupid run from these people  commented on   est it has been extremely difficult and timeconsuming to deal with claims department on long term policy they seem to be delaying intentionally i asked to speak to someone in customer service but was not referred to anyone they said someone would call me back but they did not they make it very difficult to file a claim continually saying that they did not receive the documents sent so they have to be requested again nothing can ever be done in a single call it takes days and days to get anything done months later we are still trying to get it resolved commented on   est finding it very difficult to close out death claim  commented on   est i am getting out asap due to eligibility date moved to  years old even if it costs me money not likely i will live that long commented on   est they moved up the eligibility date to start withdrawing from their annuity account until i am  years old ridiculous  commented on   est have amex annuity  could not do direct deposit ach failed payments  r has material errors preventing tax filing violates irc  commented on   est have a deferred annuity my issue is obtaining info re sub accounts perfformance expenses not much transparency commented on   est very easy to submit claims great service best company out there commented on   est every yearfor the last threei have had to reduce the benefits of my long term care insurance because the rates have increased the increases would have totaled  for decreased benefitsso far i have been able to stay in the dance but i fear that in a few years the cost will outweigh the benefits and if i drop out they will get to keep all my premiums and not have to pay out a centand rememberthey can say they never cut any benefits it was always my choice commented on   est this company should be avoided at all costs they outsource jobs overseas depriving legal us americans of jobs they refuse to honor contracts and steal your money with outrageous fees when you try and withdraw funds commented on   est stay away from them i have a variable annuity on which i am trying to effect a  exchange  they are dragging their feet big time insisting i use their forms instead of industry standard forms demanding an officer from the exchange company sign my request for my funds no copies accepted originals only  anything they can do to hold on to my money take your money and run away from this bunch commented on   est easy to work with pleasant customer service commented on   est increased cost over the years makes it hard for someone retired to afford the long term care when we most need it i have been paying since my early s and the price keeps going up i have too much invested to change to another company commented on   est took over a month to send me claim forms for my mothers death  phone calls later they finally faxed me very unreadable copies had no pdf file for me to usevery unprofessional and i will go out of my way to tell any of my friends to stay away from this company commented on   est great company that gave me the proper expectations and lived up to what they said they did not paint me too blue of a sky commented on   est amex ameriprise and riversource life have provided taxsheltered income for  years without fail and without resetting the quaranteed interest rate  commented on   est make sure you read the fine print the agent selling the policy will not tell you about possible rate increases commented on   est i have an annutity contract with them they determined the monthly withdrawal amount for us it was  over the limit allowed they would not change it and proceeded to deduct from the principal leaving me with  less than i should have no one at the company will correct their mistake i was told i had to pay an irs penalty to change it  commented on   est they have managed their books prudently during times when everyone else needs to be bailed out there are good advisors and bad advisors at every company find one you like and stay put commented on   est misled originally by the  financial advisor after nine years the annual rates have gone up twice in the last  years to a point that i can not afford to keep the policy wonder how much of a bonus the ceos received commented on   est exclusions and exceptions on my mothers longterm care policy were not made clear to her claim service was atrocious and appeared to involve intentional delaying tactics commented on   est if you work closely with an advisor  they will be an advocate for you if you are just a number  you may have the problems discussed above commented on   est i filed a long term care claim for my  year old motherinlaw in sept  my story is similar to those others on this site the claims agent was never available when i called but fortunately i did receive return calls between  and  hours each time i asked the claims agent to prequalify a facility for me before moving my motherinlaw into a facility i was told that this was not the process and that she would have to select a facility first move in and then we could begin the lengthy claims process in the meantime she would incur very expensive out of pocket costs in the hopes that the facility would be covered this is a bad faith process it should be illegal they also delayed decision for benefits because they could not find a doctors signature on the nursing home policies and procedures this is not even a condition of the policy this is ridiculous riversource will do whatever they can to avoid paying on claims we just received a denial for benefits letter in november the policy was taken out in october  riversource was happy to take our premiums but now refuses to pay benefits we are filing a claim against riversource with our states dept of insurance for bad faith in denying the claim and bad faith processes we will pursue legal action if the policy continues to be denied after appeal i would encourage anyone in my situation to file a complaint with your states dept of insurance also you may find that your state regulations mandate a maximum amount of time for which insurance cos are allowed before deciding to deny or approve a claim riversource has exceeded that time in my state and we are legally eligible for damages i would encourage you to check this out you may be eligible for this also you should know that i have never taken any legal action in my lifetime so i am not the type of person who sues over everything but this is such an extreme case of negligence i feel i must do something good luck to the rest of you and if you are reading this and considering long term care policies please do not even consider riversource  commented on   est my father has a ltc policy he purchased in  from riversource we have filed a claim on this policy in august  when he had to move to a nursing facility i have sent the required paperwork at least  times but im still being told they are missing information customer service cant tell what and im told i have to talk to the claim representative who of course is never available when i call i have also written  letters to her but again have never heard from her his premium is due in january  which they did tell me he has to pay since he hasnt received any benefits yet but im very tempted to just let this policy lapse as i cant get anyone to tell if his claim will be approved my next letter is being sent to the ceo by registered mail  commented on   est dont wast your time on purchasing any kind of insurance policy from ameriprise riversource you will never receive a penny from them they will always find a loophoe commented on   est after my advisor got all the money he could out of us over  years he acts like he dont know us other than long term we have about   mill with riversource now down to  never heard yet from advisor i called for meeting his solutionhang in there retired and feeling stuck commented on   est excellent service great product very satisfied i had a met life life insurance before and i lost it because the agent was ignorant the advisors in riversource are very informed and willing to help commented on   est i have a variable annuity account and due to market conditions now it is not doing very well im hoping for improvement  commented on   est our grandmother was also admitted to a nursing home earlier this year  she was also made a claim against her long term care insurance march her claim was approved and she is still waiting to be paid she has had  different case workers each time we call to get a status we told she has a new claim rep and that there is newadditional paperwork needed in order for her to collect i cant believe the run around this company has given her it should be illegal  commented on   est my grandmother recently went into a nursing home she had coverage with two other life insurance companies besides riversource and riversource is the only one that is dragging its feet the other two insurance companies were helpful and quick to respond where riversource drags its feet its been  months now and the only time i hear anything from riversource is when i call them to find out whats going on they have never once called me and obviously could care less if they ever do i have dropped any and all business that i currently have with them and cannot wait until this agony of dealing with them is over i will never do business with them again commented on   est riversource is the leading provider of variable universal life policies my vul and disability policy were well advised and i feel that my agentadvisor services these policies well enough commented on   est have not had an occasion to file a claim with this company  up until now i am in the process of filing a claim at this very moment an agent of this company sold me variable annuities that have surrender charges at  years each payment invested  i am  and will not be able to get my money for at least  years  i need it now so yes i am filing a complaint  today commented on   est take survey overview
