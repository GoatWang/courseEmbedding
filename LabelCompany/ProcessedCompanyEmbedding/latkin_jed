order reprint story by david shaffer • photos by david joles • star tribune buffalo lake minn – on a cold winter day white mist swirls above the smallest ethanol plant in minnesota — a sign that its back in business built two decades ago at the dawn of minnesotas ethanol industry the plant in the past four years has been idled mothballed and restarted — only to be shut down again as it stumbled through us bankruptcy court now a new owner has it running once more and is confronting a core problem facing small plants in an era of larger efficient ethanol producers the economics dont work said joe winckler an ethanol industry veteran who manages buffalo lake advanced biofuels its a persistent challenge in the industry most vintage ethanol plants including buffalo lake expanded over the years but that isnt always enough to stay competitive now some of the smallest are looking to new technologies — and new products — to stay alive feed loader jed latkin is cfo of west ventures an affiliate of platinum partners the new york hedge fund that owns the buffalo lake ethanol plant he said the fund has invested  million into the plant with plans “to foster local growth” and rebuild the business its innovate or die said randall doyal chairman of the renewable fuels association and chief executive of claremont minnbased alcorn clean fuel one of the states first ethanol plants there is a lot of competition out there if you stop trying to grow or innovate you are really dying winckler said its hard to make a profit on older ethanol plants with a capacity less than  million gallons per year the buffalo lake plant which restarted last october can produce  million gallons annually he said with wall street financing and midwestern innovation the buffalo lake plant is taking short and longterm steps to survive it temporarily turned away from corn and has instead been fermenting ethanol from cheap governmentsurplus sugar when the plant resumes cornbased production this year it will be the first ethanol producer to apply an energysaving technology from yield and capacity group ycg of clear lake iowa that promises to cut electric and natural gas bills by more than  annually it is a huge savings said jed latkin cfo of west ventures an affiliate of platinum partners the new york hedge fund that was a lender to the buffalo lake plant but ended up owning it after the plants  bankruptcy latkin said the fund has invested  million in the plant the new technology called low energy separation system eliminates equipment traditionally used to dry grains left after distilling every cornethanol plant sells distillers grains as cattle feed even a small plant like buffalo lake produces  tons of feed a year and drying the material is a big expense you are using all this extra energy and heat said mike locascio cofounder of ycg which developed the polymerbased waterseparation technology the heat destroys amino acids and proteins since we are not using any heat the feed has more digestible energy for the animal innovate or fail the buffalo lake plant  miles west of the twin cities was built with farmer investment during the first wave of ethanol plant construction in the mids in the early days it was one of nine plants that produced just  million gallons of ethanol per year or less over the next decade larger plants were built and the early ones expanded four of minnesotas  ethanol plants now can pump out  million gallons or more per year the nations largest is minnetonkabased cargills milliongallonayear ethanol plant in blair neb most minnesota plants have a capacity of  million gallons per year or less two of the small plants — in luverne and little falls — have looked beyond ethanol to stay competitive in december british biotech company green biologics purchased the ethanol plant in little falls that produces  million gallons per year and will shift production in  to renewable chemicals after a  million to  million upgrade it will process corn with bacteria rather than yeast to make normal butanol also called nbutanol and acetone they are used in paints adhesives cosmetics and other products it is not an expansion said tim staub vice president for business development we will be leveraging the existing fermenters which will be modified … we also are putting in a lot of advanced product recovery and distillation equipment yet the shift to new technologies can be risky gevo inc based in englewood colo has struggled for more than two years to produce isobutanol — a highervalue alcohol that can be used as fuel or a chemical ingredient — at the luverne plant amid slow progress last year the company resumed making ethanol in part of the plant and in january cut  headquarters employees to save money larry johnson a cologne minn ethanol consultant who helped raise capital for early plants said it has long been an industry goal to transform ethanol plants into multiproduct biorefineries he expects such efforts to continue even if some fail we are replacing some petroleumbased plastics and chemicals with products from biomass johnson said photos by david joles x djolesstartribunecom a semitrailer truck pulled through the wet grain storage area at buffalo lake advance biofuels in the ethanol business being old and small is a hurdle experiment with biodiesel in another push beyond ethanol alcorn the milliongallonperyear ethanol plant in claremont is expanding into biodiesel biodiesel has long been made from soybean oil although industrial corn oil produced at ethanol plants is an increasingly common raw material by law biodiesel is blended with regular diesel at rates of  percent to  percent in minnesota doyal alcorns chief executive said the farmerowned plant still will make ethanol but this spring will add a modular biodiesel production unit recently developed by revolution fuels of st louis park corn oil produced by alcorn will be turned into biodiesel on site it is the first commercial deployment of revolution fuels proprietary technology it fits in a unit about the size of two shipping containers and is tailored for small to midsize ethanol plants said ronni phillips revolution fuels vice president for business development the process will use a little of alcorns ethanol replacing another alcohol commonly used in biodiesel production she said changing ethanol investment one reason for the interest in nonethanol investments is that us supplies of cornbased biofuel currently exceed the demand while the market is sure to change the current slim profit margins in the ethanol business make it a risk to expand production it is probably going to be a losing proposition said david peters an iowa state professor of rural sociology who has studied the economics of ethanol plant upgrades feed loader surplus sugar purchased at rockbottom prices from the government was unloaded after being trucked into the ethanol plant at buffalo lake the sugar is a cheaper alternative to corn poet inc the nations no  ethanol producer with four minnesota plants has in the past two decades upgraded all of its  plants most recently it has focused on investments that reduce water and energy use said james moe president of design and construction and plant management for the sioux fallsbased company these plants are more efficient than they have ever been moe added they have had to incorporate efficiency improvements over time just due to the level of competition in the industry what that has really done is driven a lot of efficiency in the industry that wasnt there eight or ten years ago large producers have some builtin advantages poet constructed manages and coowns plants with local investors and does research and development its business model allows it to try new technologies in one or two plants before deploying them widely moe said poet and the nations largest ethanol maker archer daniels midland adm also have a size advantage when marketing their products smaller ethanol plants are combining efforts to to copy that approach renewable products marketing group a shakopeebased company owned by smaller ethanol makers now sells  billion gallons of ethanol per year the second largest marketer behind adm doyal said at buffalo lake the push to stay competitive directly affects  employees whose jobs are at stake latkin of west ventures said preserving jobs has always been a concern of the new york hedge fund unlike an investor who comes in and seeks to break up or send things overseas our role has always been in the different deals weve done to foster local growth build businesses and see them thrive and survive latkin said view comments read our comment standards startribunecom welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage
