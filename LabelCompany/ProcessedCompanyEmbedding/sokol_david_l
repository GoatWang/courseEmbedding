management philosophyryan c fuhrmanninvestopediamarch  reblogsharetweetshareback in  an investor group including warren buffetts berkshire hathaway helped berkshire make its first foray into the energy business the acquisition was of midamerican energy holdings company and the investor group included a gentleman by the name of david l sokol midamericans ceo in letters to shareholders buffett has since described sokol as a brilliant and terrific manager who is the enormously talented builder and operator of midamerican energysokol has frequently been mentioned as warren buffetts mr fixit and as a potential successor to buffett when its time for the oracle of omaha to step down from the helm of berkshire hathaway the admiration of one the worlds best businessmen is certainly notable so it is worth digging into what has made mr sokol such a resounding success over the yearssokol laid out many of the details of his management philosophy in his book pleased but not satisfied  the title refers to a mindset of continuous and incremental improvements on both a personal and professional level as such it contains many insights that individuals can apply to their own lives and professions like sokol himself his philosophy is very detailed and covers major and minor points including carrying out employee evaluations six principles to adhere to when running a business goal setting budgeting individual improvement and how to balance personal and business lives the lessons provide valuable business insight and also give clues as to how berkshire hathaway might be run after buffett hands over the reins for goodbackground on david sokolsokol has earned the status as buffetts righthand man since the midamerican energy acquisition after sokol built midamerican into the large utility it is today in  the company was just a geothermal business known as calenergy with an estimated  million in sales sokol through over  years of acquisitions eventually created midamerican energy holdings company with over  billion in revenue since the acquisition sokol has been called in to turnaround other berkshire companies including roofing company johns manville executive jet firm netjets and he has also been asked to look at other investments such as battery and car firm byd in china and the rescue package for constellation energy groupsokol was mentioned as a potential successor to buffett at berkshire hathaway in  and  but his personality differs sharply from buffett sokol is known to have a direct tothepoint management style and takes a systematic candid and objective approach to running businesses his engineering background is illustrative of the constant measurement and attention to detail he applies to business managementmanagement philosophysokols management philosophy can most visibly be observed through the advice he provides in regard to running a company and adopting a set of enduring principles he has developed a set of core principles for running midamerican energy and has boiled them down to what he refers to as six business principles the six commandments are offered in no particular order as each is seen as equally important as such they are simply detailed in alphabetical ordercommitment to the customerthe first consists of customer commitment sokol has used the perspective of midamerican energy which as a regulated utility has a captive customer audience that is obligated to uses its electricity and pay for it on a monthly basis no matter what happens to their jobs or income levels in many cases monopolies start to ignore customer commitment as customers have no choice but to use their products or services in addition to utilities telephone firms and cable companies come to mind and are notorious for being difficult to deal with and neglectful of serving the customer sokol refers to the opportunity as opposed to the obligation to serve customers by providing the highestquality service in a fairly priced and safe manneremployee commitment and transparencyto sokol employee commitment consists of a twoway street where employers and employees communicate with each other honestly and in a forthright manner he details that employees can expect competitive salaries training support and a safe work environment which is important for utility operators and other laborintensive jobs in addition management has an obligation to run its business properly cases where this did not occur include the auto industry where employees were laid off – not because of an event but due to many years of questionable management decisions and finally candor is important and providing immediate performance feedback as opposed to yearend reviews of dubious value to either managers or workers sokol believes in constant feedback and continuously ranks his managers from best to worstfirms that possess financial strength serve both the company and employees well returning again to the auto industry example sokols advice runs core to berkshire hathaways philosophy in that it is focused on producing a product and service that customers demand and delivering it in an efficient and lowcost manner to stay sufficiently profitable staying vigilant on the cost front can be a competitive advantage that is exploited to beat the competition and ensure operating success regardless of a boom or downturn in the business cycleemployer and employee integritysokol frequently cites buffett when referring to integrity which boils down to finding employees that possess integrity intellect and passion for their jobs integrity is very necessary as enron and tyco had business leaders with high intellect and passion for growing their firms but lacked integrity to do it in an honest and ethical manner sokol states that integrity is doing the right thing when nobody is looking and buffett has suggested imagining that anything an individual does could show up on the front page of his or her local newspaper as motivation to maintain high integrity environmental respect is closely related to integrity and also customer commitment when considering that society as a whole can be considered the end customer for many companies again a regulated utility is a prime example given the need to generate and distribute electricity and natural gas in an environmentally friendly mannerminimizing mistakesin sokols mind operational excellence consists of paying attention to detail and minimizing the making of mistakes or other small problems that could turn into big issues for example some oil companies have been cited numerous times for a lack of attention to seemingly small manners and that have resulted in oil pipeline leaks or oil well explosions in many cases these damaging events might have been less severe or could even been prevented with attention to seemingly minor maintenance activities because of a lack of attention to detail the last oil company might experience huge declines in its reputation and profits openness and candidness are other key ingredients to excellence according to sokol in his words the more uncomfortable the situation the more valuable a candid conversation becomespersonal principlessuccessfully managing other individuals and a company would not be possible without first committing oneself to individual improvement sokol lists four traits he sees as predictive of successful corporate managers these include giving a  commitment to all activities maintaining professionalism trusting ones instincts and accepting accountability for ones actions he cites individuals including einstein and tiger woods who are gifted with great natural talents in their professions but have coupled this with hard work to become truly exceptional in their fieldssokol details that it is amazing how much luckier you will become if you approach every day wellprepared and willing to outwork the competition basic blocking and tackling is a cornerstone of this philosophy and includes showing up on time for meetings being late shows disrespect as it demonstrates your time is more important than others at the meeting treating people with respect at all times and being honest and again candid in communicating with othersbalancing business and personal life is a final component to success according to sokol like many of his fellow berkshire business leaders the business life remains front and center but he does provide suggestions on how to still balance in family life again core principles used in business life are cited and include being candid with your spouse and children and constantly working out compromisesthe bottom linesokols overriding advice is that one must get the basics right and the success will follow sokol contrasts sharply with buffetts management style but he is clearly a capable individual with many successful business accomplishments that could help berkshire thrive once buffett decides to move

i will leave his verdict to a higher power mr sokol wrote in an emailed response to the wsj sokols statement comes almost two years after he left buffetts company over questionable stock trades and just days after sokols lawyer announced that the us securities and exchange commission would not charge sokol with insider trading back in  immediately following his departure buffett called sokol’s actions “inexplicable and inexcusable” its rare for an exemployee to lash out against buffett the selfmade billionaire generally has a great relationship with his executives and gives them lots of

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
