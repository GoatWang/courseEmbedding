sliding control cables sliding control cables refer to all pushpull assemblies which utilize an internal core and external conduit the core is typically made up of woven wire strands which operate within an enclosing conduit the operating characteristics of these controls efficiency backlash and minimum bend radii are determined by the materials of construction and size of the core and conduit application sliding control cables have high load carrying capabilities and are more robust but generally less efficient they derive their name from the linear sliding motion of the core within the conduit sliding controls can be used on virtually any application with a wide variety of configurations and sizes typically sliding controls are characterized by less stringent efficiency and backlash requirements light or heavy loads highly configured small in size rigid conduits field replaceable cores flexible races and tension  loaded applications favor sliding controls air data sensors —
