choosing the right options can make you more comfortable continuous positive airway pressure cpap machines are currently the most recommended treatment forobstructive sleep apnea and patients often feel major improvement after using them for just one night but before you decide whether the therapy works for you it’s important to consider the different options available where you buy your machine which type you end up with and what options are included will all affect how willing you are to use cpap and how well it will work for you getting a prescription  to get an air pressure machine you first need to be diagnosed with sleep apnea this process will probably require an overnight study in a sleep clinic a home sleep test may be another option  after your initial sleep study a technician will measure your body’s response to different air pressure or titration levels most machines range from about  to  cm h meaning that they blow enough air to create a column of water that height  your prescription can be filled at a sleep clinic or another equipment retailer it should include the following details the type of device—cpap bipap or apap for example the correct pressure level these levels are set before you receive the machine and should only be adjusted by a doctor or technician never by the patient with your machine you’ll usually receive a sixfoot hose and carrying case doctors might also include a note for a heated humidifier which makes the harsh airflow more tolerable and reduces side effects such as dry throat and nasal congestion you can buy a humidifier without a specific prescription but if it’s included on your slip you’ll be sure not to overlook it masks and other accessories can also be sold without a prescription shopping around  many centers are equipped to provide you with a cpap machine immediately after your sleep study or they can refer you to a local durable medical equipment dme supplier that sells or rents them they’ll also fit you for a mask and show you how the whole system works together  insurance usually covers or reimburses the cost of the machines choosing a mask  once your doctor finds the right air pressure level for your cpap the next step is finding a breathing device that fits well and is comfortable enough to wear through the night there are four main types of cpap masks all secured by straps around the forehead andor chin with flexible foam or gel cushioning • nasal pillows or tiny tubes that fit directly into the nostrils • nasal masks which form a seal directly around the nose • fullface masks which cover the nose and mouth • oral masks which are attached between the lips and gums most insurance companies will replace masks a few times each year and accessories like nasal cushions more frequently some cpap users like to keep two or three masks they’re comfortable with so they can switch occasionally to relieve pressure and irritation on the face  bells and whistles  depending on your lifestyle and personal preferences you may find spending a little extra money on special features such as battery backup to be worthwhile  if you use a humidifier in a cold room a rainout reduction kit can help prevent condensation from forming in the hose you can even buy hose extensions to improve your mobility and insulated sleeves to give them a softer look and feel  many cpap models contain a memory chip that helps your doctor measure your compliance others adjust pressure automatically when you travel to higher altitudes browse online retailers and talk with your medical supplier about what options might make cpap therapy more effective   navigation menuhomepage products  supplies respiratory adult  child sleep equipment  supplies pediatric services louisville bishops lane suite
