on the conference call there is a lot yet to be determined about how the newspaper industry plays out and we like the position we are in working through that the two new companies will require at least a year of seasoning to see how they operate in the new environment decherd said in a written analysis equity research firm bear stearns states that the newspaperonly company will be ripe for privatization in the longrun since oct  the spinoff has been wellreceived belos stock immediately shot up almost  it was still up nearly  this week closing at  on oct  rick edmonds media business analyst at the poynter institute said institutional investors and analysts had been suggesting the split for some time before belo pulled the trigger private ownership has grown in appeal for the newspaper business recently said scott bosley executive director of the american society of newspaper editors there are those who believe theyll private owners will accept predictable but lower margins than publicly held companies he said there are a lot of businesses that would accept a lower margin at a steady business and some investors would too who would buy it publicly traded companies can go private in a few different ways  by merging or selling its assets to a private company or by having a private company or individual buy all or most of the companys publicly held shares the newspaper business ah belo corp is set for a taxfree spinoff from the exisiting company belo corp nyse blc by early  its most likely that ceo decherd who is leaving the larger more profitable broadcasting business to lead the newspaper operation would be involved in the privatization of the paper company says lee westerfield managing directormedia analyst for bmo capital markets who has been covering belo since  he says belo has  billion in enterprise value belo estimates ah belo will have a net worth of more than  million privatization could happen but no sooner than  westerfield said its more likely there will be a management buyout than a disposition of the assets because i think robert decherd is and will continue to be the steward of ah belo journalism he said other prospective buyers are hard to name ew scripps co announced a similar split of newspaper and television interests on oct  poynters edmonds says that organization wouldnt be a likely buyer and hearst corp which owns daily newspapers of record in houston and san antonio isnt a likley buyer either he says still the structure of belos newspaper spinoff makes a buyout very possible it really sets up that possibility particularly with the debtfree structure of the deal edmonds said there remains the question who would buy it is taking the company private something that decherd and others in management would be looking at theyre certainly not in a position to say anything like that right now names aside the group that could take the newspaper operation private may look something like instate nonnewspaper businesspeople joining into a group because they believe maintaining a strong newspaper is a good thing for the city edmonds said but he agrees that the most likely scenario is for decherd and the family descended from company namesake alfred horatio belo to draw on their resources and lenders in a private market for an internal sale a year away at least despite the instant chatter ownership changes will be a long time coming thanks in large part to tax issues privatizing may  one day play into strategies of ah belo and belo but no time soon westerfield said a good rule of thumb is at least a year the federal tax code requires a lengthy seasoning period to preserve the taxfree virtue of the spinoff he said in that time edmonds says decherd will focus on improving the dallas morning news the newspaper has since  shed about  journalists or  of its newsroom through layoffs and attrition the audit bureau of circulations indicates that from october  through march  the morning news daily circulation was   a decline of  from a year earlier i think the dmn is the first priority for decherd edmonds said i think the morning news is going to get a lot of attention theyve made some very big cuts over the years i dont think theyre needing to cut anymore splitsville early next year media company belo corp will split its newspaper business from its other operations heres
