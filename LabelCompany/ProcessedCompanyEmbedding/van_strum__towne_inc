investment policy committee the decision making process is controlled by our investment policy committee made up of all the firm’s senior investment officers the committee which meets weekly analyzes pertinent macroeconomic monetary and political developments that have an overall effect on securities markets the committee also focuses on individual industries and companies based on their research recommendations are made by committee members for approval of individual securities which in our judgment offer the opportunity for longterm capital appreciation research capabilities each portfolio manager is assigned responsibility for particular industries and keeps abreast of all research in this area using trade journals and periodicals corporate annual reports sec filings and research produced by leading wall street firms based on this research each portfolio manager recommends to the committee those companies and industry sectors he or she considers attractive for purchase or sale the “buy list” through our decision making process common stocks are recommended and discussed then either approved or disapproved by the investment committee for inclusion on our approved or “buy list” the same process is used both in deleting a security from the list and in adding a name to it this list reflects our current thinking and is composed of approximately fifty companies we review companies weekly and take into account price movement new information and attractiveness relative to the market the final decision maker is the portfolio manager who is responsible for implementing buy and sell decisions based on specific client objectives and circumstances   c  van strum  towne inc sansome street suite san francisco catel infovanstrumcomdisclosuresubscribe   van strum  towne     investment strategy  approach common stocks our portfolio managers are responsible for implementing the firm’s overall investment strategy they recommend the percentage of each portfolio to be committed to equities and alternative investments our equity strategy aims at capital growth by emphasizing investment in quality companies with excellence in management a faster rate of growth than the economy and reliability in earnings growth rates in short we seek “quality growth” firms fixed income investments fixed income securities are useful to clients with certain income needs and tax requirements we emphasize highquality issues including us government bonds corporate bonds and municipal bonds we do not sacrifice quality to capture unusually high yields cash equivalents cash equivalents holding sizeable quantities of shortterm treasury obligations and other money market instruments can shelter client portfolios from risk and provide buying reserves for the future we emphasize credit quality and liquidity in the selection of cash equivalents asset allocation asset mix – the percentage levels allocated to cash fixed income securities and common stock – remains one of the most crucial elements of investment strategy our portfolio managers determine the asset allocation of each of their accounts and they are constantly reviewing these ratios to be sure they reflect the clients’ objectives and tax considerations asset allocation is also discussed at our weekly investment policy committee meetings    c  van strum  towne inc sansome street suite san
