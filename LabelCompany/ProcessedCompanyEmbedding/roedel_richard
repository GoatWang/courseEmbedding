thinking and their buying habits photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhph the polaris effect by richard roedel prnewsfotorichard roedel the polaris effect who really holds the power in creating american jobs is more than just a book  its a movement to bring back three million us manufacturing jobs rather than rely on the government or other companies roedel places the responsibility to bring back us manufacturing jobs on us citizens whose wallets affect where manufacturing jobs are sent the polaris effect is a book i wrote to educate americans on how they hold the power  not the government or anyone else  to create us jobs people dont realize that buying  of american made goods can actually create  jobs i want to convince americans how impactful their purchase decisions can be says roedel

– not the governments – to find a new job cities are filing for bankruptcy left and right look at stockton california most people look to our government for the answer but the government unfortunately does not have the solution its the public disturbed by numerous american manufactures moving their manufacturing facilities to mexico china and elsewhere the polaris effect was written to present a
