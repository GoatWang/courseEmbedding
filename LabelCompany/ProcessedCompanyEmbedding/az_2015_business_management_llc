log out my account sign in help check order status check order status contact us corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

ownership that a business can take creating a body of commercial law for each type the major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually the size and scope of the business firm and its structure management and ownership broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm generally a smaller business is more flexible while larger businesses or those with wider ownership or more formal structures will usually tend to be organized as corporations or less often partnerships in addition a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so the sector and country private profitmaking businesses are different from governmentowned bodies in some countries certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways tax advantages different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason disclosure and compliance requirements different business structures may be required to make less or more information public or report it to relevant authorities and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership either formed with or without limited liability most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant secretary of state or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations the relationships and legal rights of shareholders limited partners or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized generally speaking shareholders in a corporation limited partners in a limited partnership and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity which is legally treated as a separate person this means that unless there is misconduct the owners own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle they will be treated as a general partnership the terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located no paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership and without an agreement the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located a single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor

factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include general partners in a partnership other than a limited liability partnership plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business generally corporations are required to pay tax just like real people in some tax systems this can give rise to socalled double taxation because first the corporation pays tax on the profit and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed in most countries there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones they may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws have simplified procedures in specialized areas and have simplified advantageous or slightly different tax treatment going public through a process known as an initial public offering ipo means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public this requires the organization as a distinct entity to disclose information to the public and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures most public entities are corporations that have sold shares but increasingly there are also

capable of change than a functionally focused traditional hierarchical management approachwho organization and regulationedit see also theory of the firm most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take creating a body of commercial law for each type the major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually the size and scope of the business firm and its structure management and ownership broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm generally a smaller business is more flexible while larger businesses or those with wider ownership or more formal structures will usually tend to be organized as corporations or less often partnerships in addition a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so the sector and country private profitmaking businesses are different from governmentowned bodies in some countries certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways tax advantages different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason disclosure and compliance requirements different business structures may be required to make less or more information public or report it to relevant authorities and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership either formed with or without limited liability most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant secretary of state or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations the relationships and legal rights of shareholders limited partners or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized generally speaking shareholders in a corporation limited partners in a limited partnership and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity which is legally treated as a separate person this means that unless there is misconduct the owners own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle they will be treated as a general partnership the terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located no paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership and without an agreement the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located a single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity depending on the business needs an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable a few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include general partners in a partnership other than a limited liability partnership plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business generally corporations are required to pay tax just like real people in some tax systems this can give rise to socalled double taxation because first the corporation pays tax on the profit and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed in most countries there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones they may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws have simplified procedures in specialized areas and have simplified advantageous or slightly different tax treatment going public through a process known as an initial public offering ipo means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public this requires the organization as a distinct entity to disclose information to the public and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures most public entities are corporations that have sold shares but increasingly there are also public llcs that sell units sometimes also called shares and other more exotic entities as well such as for example real estate investment trusts in the usa and unit trusts in the uk a general partnership cannot go public commercial lawedit main article corporate law offices in the los angeles downtown financial district a very detailed and wellestablished body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions the need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts the code of hammurabi
