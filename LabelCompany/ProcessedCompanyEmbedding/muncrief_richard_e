please review them so with that rick ill turn it over to you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you david and good morning to everyone on the call we appreciate your interest and investment in our team i want to start today by recognizing the volatility in todays commodity prices i know its on everyones mind its on my mind obviously were faced with nearterm headwinds there will always be ups and downs and swings to the left and right in the market at wpx we have a longterm strategy and a balanced yet flexible game plan we can play the defense like weve done before by cutting capital spending maintaining attractive hedge positions and actively managing our revolver and the terms of it we can also play offense like we did recently with our previously announced acquisition in the permian basin as ive said before the time to buy is when prices are down when prices are higher well be very busy drilling with experience comes perspective and there is an extremely knowledgeable highly seasoned management team in place here weve been down these roads before along those lines i want to emphasize that our ability to execute is one of our strengths we bolstered our balance sheet which allowed us to be optimistic with our permian acquisition and were going to be just as aggressive in reestablishing our balance sheets strength we havent even closed on the rki transaction but the delevering activity is already underway in terms of our quarterly results we continue to drive significant change and measurable improvements across the company theres a higher standard here now for capital allocation talent acquisition spending career development and how we go about maximizing the opportunities in each of our basins the diversity in our portfolio both geographically and by product mix is one of the things that sets wpx apart we have high margin oil growth all while sitting on a mountain of massive natural gas option value we have three core basins along with a new cleanup hitter that were now adding thats the permian basin that i referred to earlier all of our operations are focused in the western us which has the advantages of higher commodity pricing and quicker access to markets through established infrastructure we are completely focused on value creation regardless of whether commodity prices are up or down pricing challenges are simply opportunities for us to flex our muscles and demonstrate our creativity to deliver value so lets turn to slide two this was another strong quarter the results youre seeing show whats possible as we integrate technical excellence into our operations oil production was up  our cash operating expenses were down  thats very much a winning formula we have a set of assets that are performing well and posting excellent results despite depressed commodity prices for example our yeartodate cash margins are only  lower than a year ago despite a  decrease in commodity prices you can also see items on this page that show the quality of the rock were developing our ability to increase our scale through bolton opportunities as well as our ability to bring dollars in the door by shedding noncore assets everything is on track with our previous – turning to slide three excuse me everything is on track with our previously announced acquisition in the permian basin as we become more familiar with rki and its people over the past few weeks were more confident than ever about the benefits of this merger we expect to complete the merger this month thats a very quick process for a transaction of this size and it underscores the complementary nature of our two companies once we close were going to hit the ground running ultimately we believe this transaction will help us take our strategy further and execute it faster with rki we acquired an enormous highquality drilling inventory across stacked pay a company with existing production a substantial midstream infrastructure and acreage in the very core of the permians delaware basin theres two things that i want to emphasize about this transaction number one the upside opportunities and number two our ability to focus to quickly delever on the upside keep in mind that our metrics around this transaction are based on the historical data that weve seen and are inheriting their results to date are based on a somewhat conservative approach to operations such as doing  pounds to pounds per foot of proppant on their completions while most peers are doing twice that second and i want to be very clear about this we have set our targets for delevering and were moving quickly before you bet against our team i want to point out what weve accomplished in the last year as a quick refresher we divested our international operations most of our holdings in the marcellus a couple of complex transportation positions and some working interest in the piceance basin involving two separate transactions and as i said earlier we get things done and were going to act quickly and aggressively on our delevering plan we are targeting  million to  million in divestures before the end of this year and another  million to  million of proceeds in  a lot of our own pipe that weve put in place around our assets will fetch very attractive multiples in fact right now could be one of the most opportune times ever to be marketing midstream assets were also creative were willing to entertain proposals that are consistent with our blueprint for creating shareholder value and with that heres clay gaspar our senior vice president of operations  resource development clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development thank you rick before we get into the nuts and bolts i want to recognize the people who have really taken our operations to next level our teams out in the field and here in tulsa have benefited from being immersed in the operations and from that vantage they get to see realtime wins that we are achieving on all fronts while enduring an amazing amount of change in a short amount of time in the midst of a major industry downturn theyve not only embraced our drive for operational excellence theyre leading it two weeks ago our asset teams walked our senior leadership through a revamped quarterly review process these reviews are designed to be a combination of progress update a direct twoway communication tool and an important means of accountability as rick said weve seen a lot of change at wpx in a short period leadership changes organization asset sales contract renegotiations process improvement office consolidation and importantly the evolution of our corporate culture these changes have been rapidly implemented but not taken on without significant thought and consideration i believe that its also very important in this environment to underscore our dedication to capital management from an overall capital insensitive  perspective as well as the proper allocations of the best investments since december weve dropped from  rigs to  rigs we know how to aggressively cut spending when its the right business decision starting with our current rig fleet adding the rigs that we will inherent from rki and other rigs that weve previously discussed bringing on we will only have one longterm contract and were also in a very high hbp position this gives us a lot of capital flexibilities and you can bet well exercise it lets turn to slide five and talk a little bit about the williston basin the williston basin is loaded with tangible examples of operational excellence that we are seeking to achieve as a matter of course around the company our completion team is quickly adapting industrys best practices to extract significantly more value from this high quality asset we are currently completing the first round of wells with a new approach to perforation strategy carrying fluid design profit size concentration and total volume pumped were confident that the revised eur completion designs – revised completion design will result in significantly higher eurs and well be able to tune these designs in the depressed stimulation market we have drilled five threemile laterals leading the industry to new territory where appropriate were using cutting edge rotary steerable tools that offer much better penetration rates but until recently have been too costly to use in most resource plays we have significantly lower loe through smarter operations better contracting and efficiency gains all of these actions create real value for the shareholders turning to slide six in the san juan gallup the key word is efficiency today were doing more with less particularly in regards to our rig count weve driven drilling days down to a single digit and were pushing the boundaries of whats been done before in the basin we mentioned on this slide that weve drilled two wells in under eight days the update is that this week we drilled a well from spud to rig release in  days drilling more than a mile down and a mile over and that amount of time is impressive by any standard we recently drilled the longest lateral in the basin not just once but managed to break our own record two more times and the third well measuring over  feet with a nearly  feet of lateral weve also focused on execution in regards to growing our position two years ago we were roughly  acres in the gallup we now have  acres in the best part of the oil window i should also mention that our marketing team continues to do an excellent job of lowering differentials and creating value we reduced our netbacks by nearly  and we have clear line of sight to additional savings going forward let me pause for a second to make an important point please dont mistake my excitement for operational progress as an indication that were solely taking technical objectives rather than economic ones we are laser focused on value creation for the shareholder we believe the improvements we are making are critical to the ability to extract value but if the evidence were to lead us in a different direction than our current path of longer laterals and higher intensity completions you can bet well move aggressively towards value turning to slide seven the piceance continues to be a consistent performer weve made significant progress in delineating our niobrara play there is no doubt about the resource potential – its huge weve been plowing through the technical challenges and improving our drilling times dramatically we just drilled our first twomile niobrara lateral and the team did it in less than half the time of a onemile lateral we drilled a year ago if youll notice on the graph the green line representing the drilling progress for the longer lateral actually reaches total depth at  days the flat spot after this point is what the drillers see as an opportunity for improvement on the next well a day well will be another  drop in days and its clearly achievable from the evidence weve seen thus far but even with the technical progress the programs struggled to compete for the capital the team understands the brutal nature of our capital allocation process lastly week we dropped the niobrara rig and were going to focus on studying the well results we have to better understand how we create value from this massive resource in our mesa verde play we are aggressively working to better understand the enormous value proposition our piceance team knows how to pinch a penny as well as anyone out there that mindset and performance are key to driving down costs and focusing on margins but sometimes to focus on costs we miss an opportunity to create value with the remaining rig were running in the basin were now moving counter to our multiple year down spacing trend the team is experimenting with wider space wells and larger stateoftheart completions to see if the resulting larger eur will generate competitive returns the upside related to this project is very significant in understanding the value of this amazing asset now ill turn it over to kevin vann our cfo j kevin vann  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks clay and thanks to your team for yet another solid quarter of execution both rick and clay have provided some detail on the accomplishments of the second quarter i will cover a few further specifics around production ebitdax adjusted net income and finally capital activity given our permian acquisition and our expected closing for later this month i will also touch on our update guidance metrics and what the results through the first half of the year mean for the full year i will also provide a picture of what our pro forma hedge position for oil and gas look like given additional hedging we did in the quarter coupled with rki hedges assumed as part of the transaction as rick mentioned our oil production was  higher in the second quarter of this year versus last year we produced nearly  barrels of oil per day during the quarter this figure represents a slight drop from the first quarter however as you know we had made the decision to defer completions in the williston basin and the second quarter results reflect it when comparing the second quarter of  to prior year the williston basin still posted a  increase in production while the san juan team continued their impressive growth story by posting oil growth of over  for our natural gas production of  million cubic feet per day is down  billion cubic feet or  from the second quarter of  however when you consider the impact of the two dispositions that affected quartertoquarter comparison our natural gas volumes were down by only approximately  as you are aware the second quarter of  includes production from both the working interest in piceance wells for which we sold the legacy reserves in may of last year and our previously owned marcellus property in the susquehanna county for which southwestern energy purchased that sale closed in late january of this year these divestitures account for nearly  million cubic feet per day of production during the second quarter of  our ngl production for the quarter came in at  barrels per day which was up from second quarter of last year by nearly  barrels and nearly  barrels higher than the first quarter of this year the increase was driven by higher ethane recovery rates at the meeker plant in colorado together with higher production coming out of the san juan gallup so again our combined oil and liquids production reached an alltime high of  barrels per day or approximately  of our total production on a revenue bases our liquids production now represents over half of our total revenues at  with the impressive growth in oil volumes coupled with our continued focus on cost we are reporting an adjusted ebitdax of  million which is down approximately  from the second quarter of last year however these results were achieved in the commodity price environment where oil prices were down over  and natural gas prices were down  said another way our commodity revenues were down  million and despite this challenging commodity environment our adjusted ebitdax for the quarter and yeartodate was down by just around  we remain focused on delivering on our strategy of increasing margins through our prudent management of costs and operational excellence we are reporting an adjusted net loss of  million for the quarter versus an adjusted net income of  million in the prior year this decline again was driven by lower commodity prices but was greatly mitigated by our focus on cost and the hedging decisions we made in the prior year our capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled  million compared to  million in the second quarter of  this amount is consistent with where we anticipated being at this point in the year and keeps us on track with our full year guidance and new activity i will note that on a yeartodate basis our new capital activity totals  million whereas our cash flows from operations totaled  million we designed our capital program to be primarily funded by operating cash flows and we are delivering now to guidance there are a couple items i want to highlight first and foremost we are incorporating the projected results of rki into our guidance under the presumption that we close in the back half of august including those results we are raising our fullyear production guidance to a range of a  to  equivalent barrels per day up from our previous guidance range of  to  barrels of equivalent oil per day in addition we have increased our capital guidance to a range  million to  million which includes the expected capital activity in the permian other notable changes include lowering our expected fullyear oil differentials from wti less  to  to wti less  to  these new differentials incorporate our expectations on the rki production post close also given the continued realizations of lower loe and gpt on a per boe basis we have slightly lowered those projections we have raised our dda expense guidance for the fullyear by  reflecting two major contributors first higher production volumes and second an increase in the rate driven by a decrease in the estimated reserves used in the calculation of it the sec rules require reserves to be estimated based on a trailing month average commodity price as prices have declined over the course of the last six months our dda rate per boe has increased lastly we have increased the range on our ga to  million to  million to reflect the rki ga expenses lowered our guidance on exploration expenses and increased our interest expense which is obviously driven by the new bonds issued to fund the consideration for the acquisition turning to slide  you will see the pro forma commodity hedging profile for the portfolio postclosing of the rki transaction our natural gas hedge position will consist of approximately  per day of fixed price swaps at  and another  per day of collars with a floor of  this puts us at nearly  hedged for the balance of this year for  we have over  per day hedged through fixed price loss at  given the current balance of  pricing and fullyear strip pricing in  our natural gas hedge book will continue to provide financial support to our cash flows especially in these volatile commodity markets i will point out that the average price of our basis swaps continues to be around  to  per mmbtu we have said it before that having natural gas exposure in the western united states continues to assist in our relative returns as far as oil hedges we have nearly  barrels hedged for the balance of this year at an average price at  on a pro forma basis this is a substantial percentage of our remaining production forecasted for this year and finally we have made a significant increase since the end of the first quarter in our crude oil hedging position for  with over  barrels hedged at a price of over  per barrel this strong hedging position demonstrates our focus on managing commodity risk and protecting cash flows the quarter was yet another good quarter operationally and financially as rick indicated earlier we are focused on our delevering execution and i am extremely confident and excited about what the rki assets provide in our continued story of margin improvement now id like to turn it back over to rick richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you kevin turning to slide  i am extremely excited about this new opportunity and company thats emerging and when i saying new i mean that sincerely with the rki transaction were combining two companies into a new one one thats going to be stronger a force to be reckoned with within our industry and one that has decades of attractive drilling inventory and even before we add the permian basin to our mix weve already posted double volume growth in each of the past three years were going to get stronger and better with the rki transaction and were going to quickly delever in order to reestablish the strength of our balance sheet so as i look at the math we have great assets were in the core of the core in each our four basins and we have optionality in regards to capital flexibility to ensure that can maximize returns for our shareholders this concludes the presentation portion of todays call and at this time we would be happy to open up the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of david heikkinen from heikkinen energy advisors your line is open richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director good morning dave operator and it looks like hes removed himself from the queue your next question comes from the line of jeffrey campbell from tuohy brothers your line is open jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc good morning richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director good morning jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc just referring to the slide that we were looking at slide  it shows in the permian acquisition  net prospective acres obviously thats looking at the acreage from a multizone standpoint i was just wondering kind of going into this transaction what do you expect to be the zones that youre going to be testing sooner rather than later richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director clay do you want to field that clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah happy to take that jeff initially were going to focus on the wolfcamp a the second bone spring and the vertical delaware but were going to take a balanced approach to also start testing some of the other horizons that were seeing some of our close neighbors making some really good wells with as well jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc okay the press release highlighted tailoring piceance valley and ryan gulch well density and frac designs to achieve rates of return that can compete with oil i was just wondering what sort of production uplift is required to achieve those returns clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah as an example of the value we talked about eurs just a little – probably about  bcf per well as a standard eur what were seeing with these – from past history where weve seen similar completion results from a spacing standpoint but we havent applied yet is the improved fracture technology we think we can get to  bcf wells without too much of a stretch that would put us in the hunt i think theres a series of other things were looking at as well on how to extract value further downstream be it from the gpt contracts or even further downstream than that to put us in a better position to compete directly jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc okay great and if i could – i dont want to hog it up here if i could ask one more question i noted your discussion a little earlier about the san juan midstream and how youre getting better cost reduction to basis differentials from the infrastructure that youre installing there just thinking out a little bit do you feel that that infrastructure is going to retain more value by staying within the company or do you think it would eventually be attractive landing in an mlp structure richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director yeah well certainly jeffrey as you structure development initially it very much is probably advantageous for you to maintain the operations and the ownership of that midstream at some point in time it may flip and part of that is just due to the valuation everything has got a price and thats one of the things i really love about our picture right now is weve got a lot of flexibility and lot of optionality weve talked about in the prepared remarks and so at some point in time that asset very well could be in the hunt jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc is it also fair to say theres some commodity sensitivity involved as well because i mean if youre saving  a barrel when oils  a barrel thats a lot more valuable than if its  richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thats exactly right and thats one of the things that has to go into your considerations as you evaluate what you do absolutely good point jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc great thanks very much appreciate it richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director you bet operator your next question comes from the line of david heikkinen from heikkinen energy advisors go ahead caller your line is open david martin heikkinen  heikkinen energy advisors sorry about that earlier richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thants okay david martin heikkinen  heikkinen energy advisors when i think about your midstream business particularly in the delaware basin do you ever consider doing your own mlp as opposed to the monetization of those midstream type assets across the portfolio richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director you know david i think you have to look at all of our options and thats something you could certainly look at thats where we potentially have the scale that you could consider something like that some of our other assets on the midstream side im not sure that we have the scale of it on a standalone basis but as you look at what we have there both the water the gas and some of our plans around crude oil gathering along with the bolton operations theres just a lot of potential there so its something that we would evaluate david martin heikkinen  heikkinen energy advisors okay and then the upspacing commentary in the piceance what would expect as an eur productivity uplift like how much time do you need to know from a production history standpoint to really evaluate the ongoing thoughts of the new completion designs in the piceance asset clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah great question dave so the benefit that we have is that we have  existing wells and so the first thing the team has done is looked through our history and say okay which wells have we completed that most similarly look like what were trying to accomplish so we have lots of  acre wells in our history we dont have exactly the completion designs but can kind of narrow in to get an idea of what the uplift could be so we have a pretty good feel as a starting point when we actually get production and be able to lay over that type curve i think well know in relatively short fashion  days to  days if were on the right track or not david martin heikkinen  heikkinen energy advisors okay thank you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director dave let me also interject that as were going through the asset reviews and you had all the permian curves if you will of all the historic wells that you had you had a handful of outliers that were obviously just outperforming just lapping everything else and clays question to the team was my goodness tell me about these wells clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development you can say that again richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director and thats where you get excited about the spacing and the stimulation upside david martin heikkinen  heikkinen energy advisors okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of david amoss from iberia capital partners your line is open david meagher amoss  iberia capital partners llc good morning guys richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director hi dave david meagher amoss  iberia capital partners llc rick i want to start kind of high level and just run through a potential stress case when you think about activity lets just assume that oil stays in the  range for an extended period of time what type of activity level could we be looking at in  versus the plan that you laid out with the acquisition richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director well i think let me ask you dave when you say the  range if were talking  for wti then i think youre going to have a very very limit amount of activity at  its probably in the range where were at right now and as weve said in our press release in the bakken where weve talked about adding a second and third rig those are welltowell type contracts and so to think wed have – if we really felt it was going to be sustained at  were going to have a minimal amount of activity and then as you get north of  thats where you start adding some more rigs clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development and david this is clay if i could just add a point to that we look at it from a macro standpoint and say okay how does our capital intensity look relative to our capital spend and as we look at the individual returns that we are creating from these wells thats kind of how we get to the spend rate so certainly as our overall cash flow is reduced by commodity price thatll affect overall cash – excuse me capital investment but as were able to fight that off with better performance and then strike better returns then we can look to achieve that and push that even further richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director the other thing i may also add is although weve come a long way in our resource assessment of understanding our assets i will say that theres still an element we have some ideas around the lower benches up in three forks up in the bakken were looking at looking at some interesting things out in the gallup some ideas we may have there and then obviously as clay stated real well earlier an earlier question weve got some other ideas we want to test some of the concepts down in the delaware so weve got some things we still want to try and so that would weigh a little bit on your rig activity as well just to try to gain a deeper and further understanding of our assets i can tell you with the cost structures were seeing now from a service perspective now is a wonderful time to be doing some resource assessment david meagher amoss  iberia capital partners llc good point and thats really helpful and kind of leads me into my follow up clay this quarter specifically youve heard several of your very direct neighbors in the williston basin come out and talk about eurs in the  barrel to  million barrel range for – lets call it  million a well and youve made great strides in improving the eur uplift recently and well cost is obviously trending in the right direction can you point us in the direction of is that a reasonable target the  barrels to  million barrels for  million is that something that youre striving towards or should we be looking at the next six months of your williston program differently clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development well the politically correct answer is absolutely because you just said it in front of my boss david meagher amoss  iberia capital partners llc fair enough clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development but no we absolutely have our eye on all the neighbors from an eur perspective i assure you their rock is no better than our rock we sit in the heart of the williston basin we have some of the best rock around its just a matter of unlocking the completion code and i can tell you were making huge strides in that regard weve thrown out the  barrels just as an indication that were confident again from prior experience and what weve been able to deliver were confident that  barrels i dont want to put a stake in the ground at  barrels to  million barrels but i have no reason to believe that thats not achievable at this point on the cost side weve come down we started in a pretty good hole worked our way out of that and i would say were competitive now i would never said were top quartile on cost but we want to get there and so we are now working towards an  million well cost if were at  barrels i would say that the team continues to make strides on the cost side cost is a little bit trickier because as you upside it to the completion you may end up giving back a little bit on the on the well cost so were looking at that value proposition but the numbers youve thrown out certainly arent out of the realm of our possibility david meagher amoss  iberia capital partners llc thats really helpful thank you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of robert duboff from oppenheimer your line is open robert duboff  oppenheimer  co inc yes hi good morning guys richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director hey robert robert duboff  oppenheimer  co inc on the new capex guidance during the rki call last month you were talking about i believe  million to  billion and now youre guiding to  million to  million can you just talk about the variance are you now actually looking at lower activity or is there just something else im missing j kevin vann  chief financial officer  senior vice president no thats a matter of just the timing of when you assume that we were to takeover and close the transaction so if you assume a september  or a late august close date versus what wed have originally assumed in those economics those economics assumed what it would look like for basically about half the year of  robert duboff  oppenheimer  co inc oh okay and if i can get a follow up just on the ethane recovery i noticed its spiked up a little this last quarter and even though youre still guiding for  for the full year can you just talk about what happened there michael r fiser  senior vice president of marketing sure this is mike fiser the recoveries in q are around  compared to  in q we have a couple of different processors out there enterprise and williams and the enterprise facility actually is recovering more ethane its hard for us to determine exactly what thats going to look like monthtomonth and quartertoquarter our outlet right now is probably to be in that same range balance of year but we dont actually control that decision but were assuming that itll be somewhere close to that for balance of year robert duboff  oppenheimer  co inc all right great thanks very much richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of robert christensen from imperial capital your line is open robert christensen  imperial capital llc thank you very much gentlemen on the delaware basin acquisition how much of those lands are federal weve heard something about the difficulties of getting permits on time clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development hey bob this is clay one of the reasons we were attracted to this permian position is because we do have so much federal already in our portfolio we see this as very complementary to our portfolio in that regard the stateline field is the heart of the field it mostly sits on the texas side and so all of that is fee land as you move to the north into new mexico a lot of that is federal land but its a little different federal land its a little easier to work in that area and so we think its a good beneficial asset for our portfolio in that regard robert christensen  imperial capital llc im a little confused federal land is federal land i thought and there was another one of your competitors talking about – cant outrun our permits permits are to seven months to eight months to drill here in new mexico and getting a permit inventory is a constant i dont understand what you just described im sorry richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director yeah robert christensen  imperial capital llc  this morning richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director yeah yeah bob this is rick i do know because ive worked on federal land for the better part of  years and so you do see some variations in the different blm districts on  robert christensen  imperial capital llc yeah richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director on how they permit how efficient they are sometimes they have resource issues themselves and so i would say that a company like us were very very used to dealing with that we know how important it is to plan if you have not been working on federal lands – and the state of texas really doesnt have federal lands – but if you have traditionally worked there and then suddenly you start working on federal lands it is a new ball game and so i think that from our perspective we certainly dont see it as an issue and ill also say that on many of those federal lands from our perspective that thats where we see a higher percentage of our nonoperated interest as well and as clay mentioned the heart of our acreage is that state line area which is predominantly in loving county texas clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development one thing ill add to that bob is we are inheriting this position with a nice inventory of permits and the blm office we work with new mexico is very savvy these guys have been in the oil and gas business the heart of it very good so they do a real good job there robert christensen  imperial capital llc right richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director theyre very busy though you got to reserve them richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director yeah there is lot of activity a lot of excitement in the delaware let me tell you robert christensen  imperial capital llc oh im well aware of that okay thank you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeffrey campbell from tuohy brothers your line is open jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc thanks for getting me back in i just wanted to ask one follow up youve been drilling some really long wells lately k in the williston and  point  in the san juan  im just wondering are you seeing any enhanced performance characteristics from these wells or is this just simply a matter of better economics avoiding an extra vertical well bore richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director well i think what you see is a combination in the bakken we are seeing some very nice returns the three mile laterals weve drilled there have been driven primarily by the fact of some geographic situations with a lake and so youve got some stranded sections and so youre looking at needing to drill  mile laterals to access that last section theres a couple ways that you can look at that number one is youll never recover value from that section and in my mind thats certainly value enhancing and then in the san juan where clay and his team have just drilled the  foot lateral well see with time that well has just been drilled and weve not got it completed yet completion operations are underway jeffrey campbell  touhy brothers investment research inc okay well well look forward to that thank you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director you bet operator your next question comes from the line of andrew coleman from raymond james your line is open andrew coleman  raymond james  associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions guys the first one was for clay and its – youre seeing some other operators i guess people that are in the bakken but also those talking about change in the cluster spacing and proppant size could you just go back over the rescue that youall are using and whats your i guess the steps and things that you might change as you roll through the back half of  and then into  clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development sure andrew i appreciate the question i think the first thing were doing is the right thing to do which is look across the fence and see what those other very capable operators are achieving were plugged into the service companies were really studying all the work thats being done and then were acting upon it as i mentioned we have our first four wells were just getting back into the completion and each of those have a little bit unique test to them and so were testing  million pounds  million pounds different prop size you talked about perf cluster spacing tightening those up in a couple of the different wells and then also gel loadings crosslinked versus slick water sand versus the manmade proppant and so theres a lot of things that were testing and were doing it in a very strategic time measured approach to see where the value really gets achieved in each one of those andrew coleman  raymond james  associates inc okay all right thank you and then a question on the midstream side and are you looking at the possibility of doing something with just the water side of things or i guess separating the water from the gathering or is the plan to kind of try something on the midstream side with all the assets at once richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director andrew we do have that optionality to separate the water gathering systems that we have from some of the gas gathering or crude oil gathering but theres a lot of demand for those water gathering systems they drive a lot of value and since weve announced rki transaction our phone has literally been ringing off the hook and a lot of interest in the water gathering a lot of interest in the gas gathering and the crude oil gathering systems that we have so id say right now everythings in play andrew coleman  raymond james  associates inc excellent its good to have those options the last question was just kind of looking at the yall being one of the fewer companies adding some additional rigs here in the back half of the year i guess were getting close to when that bakken rigs going to be on location but do you anticipate or have you seen so far any folks going nonconsent on activity in any of your major operating regions richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director no in the williston specifically we have a lot of under consent and a large working interest up there so were talking about adding rigs in the core of the corridor of the bakken thats something people will not go typically nonconsent on so we dont expect that andrew coleman  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you for your time today richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director okay thank you andrew operator your next question comes from the line of gail nicholson from klr group your line is open gail nicholson  klr group llc good morning everyone just curious on those threemile laterals in the williston what are the well costs on them richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director i think – what are you looking at  million clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director something like that clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah  million maybe a little bit higher because at least one of those – we drilled five earlier on in the process we havent completed we have a couple more to complete and so theyll benefit more directly from the better costs were seeing so its kind of a blended cost but generically as you think about it that incremental lateral as long as everything is going good that extra  feet you can blow that through in just a few more days and so your real cost is the completion cost and it will just be proportional to the incremental lateral length gail nicholson  klr group llc great thank you and then on the san juan the  locations that you give in the oil window are based on  foot laterals from a carry standpoint youve been pushing that lateral length have you quantified the effect of the location count change utilizing a longer lateral on a goforward basis or youre still in the testing mode and havent made any decisions yet clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development yeah so what weve done is we kept the  feet which keeps the well count intact i personally hope the longer laterals prove up and that as we develop these larger units itll get us a lot more flexibility to drill the longer laterals i think what were seeing in most every other basin is the longer laterals typically win from an economic standpoint and end of the day were trying to create value and if we do it by drilling fewer wells im all in favor of that we happen to have a huge amount of oil inventory these days so that works pretty well in our favor richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director gail i may interject also that in the second quarter we announced a transaction where we picked up another  acre and its right there in the core it really sets clay and his team up for more of those longer laterals and so the value creation that hes referring to really in my mind are twofold number one is the well cost and efficiency those sort of things and then number two is we have built out our midstream we have to lay a lot less pipe basically to gather the same amount of gas or crude or water thats where the economics that additional acreage we picked up really really are going to come into play with those kind of efficiencies as well gail nicholson  klr group llc okay great thank you richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator and again we have a question from the line of robert christensen of imperial capital go ahead caller your line is open robert christensen  imperial capital llc yeah thank you in the williston basin i see a sequential decline in oil in the first quarter of  is that the underlying decline rate in the williston basin clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development i wouldnt call it the pure decline we have actually had a few of the completions trickle into the early part of the second quarter and then as you well know when you have a bunch of brand new wells that decline gets very steep at the beginning and then tapers off starting the completions back in the third quarter well have a little bit of benefit there from the wells were drilling – or the wells were completing in the third quarter and if we stay on track to complete the drill on complete wells for the remainder of the year we should see that curve flatten through the rest of the year robert christensen  imperial capital llc yeah thats helpful i anticipate something of a positive nature coming there with whats going on i just wanted to kind of get a sense because were all watching industry and whats prone to happen with lesser activity so i mean this is somewhat reflective of a decline rate correct richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director i think thats fair it is a little bit of  robert christensen  imperial capital llc i want to just be fair to myself and  richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think thats a great question observation and it is sometimes a little more complex and as clay mentioned you have timing of some completions trickling in robert christensen  imperial capital llc sure richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director the other thing that happens is that producers as they complete wells they may have offsetting wells shut in well if youre not completing wells youre going to bring all of those wells on and so from our perspective once you start seeing people start completing wells youre going to see some wells offset shutin so it gets a little cloudy at times but i think youre looking for the same thing that everyone else is looking for and thats when are you going to start seeing volumes from a higher level start to roll over robert christensen  imperial capital llc thats precisely it thank you very much richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director thank you clay m gaspar  senior vpoperations  resource development thanks bob robert christensen  imperial capital llc thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to mr muncrief richard e muncrief  president chief executive officer  director okay well thanks for joining us today everyone we look forward to closing the rki transaction quickly executing our plan to delever and continuing to deliver as we build our new identity as the premier western producer we will keep you updated on our progress thank you very much
