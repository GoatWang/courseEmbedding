instant access and start playing get involved with this game as it develops note this early access game is not complete and may or may not change further if you are not excited to play this game in its current state then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development learn more what the developers have to say why early access “the development of software inc is a oneman operation i chose early access because ill need feedback since it’s impossible to uncover all design flaws and issues by myself the support i’ve gained through early access has allowed me to work on software inc full time which has enabled me to greatly speed up development and give it the full attention it deserves” approximately how long will this game be in early access “software inc will be out of early access when i feel it is ready this is not a race and i don’t have investors pressuring me into releasing it early i have a great opportunity to make this game as good as i possibly can hopefully the backlog of patch notes will be testament to my ongoing efforts developing the game at a reasonable pace while adding interesting new features i’m aiming for a full release in  but i won’t promise anything” how is the full version planned to differ from the early access version “you can find the roadmap on trello at httpstrellocombimhusoftwareinc my plans for software inc change often depending on feedback and suggestions i receive or if i stumble upon a good compromise that said i have a clear goal in mind to keep me from working on the game endlessly” what is the current state of the early access version “the game currently features complex and expansive building mechanics a very deep market simulation and an engrossing simulation of the daytoday life of a software company the game still lacks in content but it has workshop support with more to come the game is not fully balanced and the core gameplay is still being revised” will the game be priced differently during and after early access “the price will increase as the game progresses from alpha to final release the game is cheaper the earlier you buy it as a “thank you” for supporting the development of software inc in its early stages” how are you planning on involving the community in your development process “the community plays a huge role in the development of software inc i constantly read feedback take on suggestions and i often reconsider my stance on certain features the development process is a big part of the product which i believe is the way early access is supposed to be it is important to note that as one developer there are limits to the amount of feedback i can physically absorb while still finishing the game and making sure i don’t pass out in front of my computer” read
