instance it is enigmatic in its wording its oddly times historical references and its controversial interpretation of events with an obvious theological agenda namely to convince you to believe and follow jesus christin john nivac seasoned johannine scholar gary burge unpacks the gospel of john revealing a message that is as powerful compelling and transforming today as it was when john wrote the book indeed burge tends to follow johns lead by telling johns story after him while always pointing towards the word made flesh jesus christ product information▼▲ format hardcovernumber of pages

return journey on our own in other words they focus on the original meaning of the passage but dont discuss its contemporary application the information they offer is valuablebut the job is only half done the niv application commentary series helps us with both halves of the interpretive task this new and unique series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into a modern context it explains not only what the bible meant but also how it can speak powerfully today author bio▼▲ gary m burge phd kings college aberdeen university is a professor of new testament in the department of

promises to become an indispensable tool for every pastor and teacher who seeks to make the bibles timeless message speak to this generation billy graham here at last is a commentary that makes the proper circuit from the biblical world to main street the niv application commentary is magnificent gift to the church kent hughes college church wheaton il here at last is a commentary which is not

to avoid hanging applicational elephants from interpretive threads then the niv application commentary series is for you this series excels at both original meaning and contemporary significance i support it one hundred percent howard j hendricks dallas theological seminary this is the pulpit for the st century george k brushaber president bethel college  seminary it takes more than interpretation of gods word to change lives it takes application application is the bottom line in teaching and preaching without it weve missed the point of the bible the niv application commentary
