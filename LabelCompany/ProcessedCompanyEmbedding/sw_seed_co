article “the  california drought has brought much public attention to the amount of water used in agriculture and particularly which crops use the most water contrary to some popular views alfalfa has a range of positive biological characteristics that should be quite useful when facing watershort conditions these characteristics include a high degree of flexibility to ‘deficit irrigate’ the crop ability to survive drought periods high wateruse efficiency deep rootedness salinity tolerance and the ability to utilize degraded water it is additionally very valuable to wildlife which also suffers

processing for the alfalfa and stevia industries each day that passes three major issues affect the world’s population first the population of the world continues to increase secondly the availability of arable land continues to decrease this creates a dire set of circumstances for farmers trying to feed a population increasingly wanting a diet which includes many of the foods that alfalfa hay the “queen of forages” supports including milk cheeses and beef third the rates of obesity diabetes and other healthrelated issues continue to rise around the world much of which has been attributed to the overconsumption of sugar a natural alternative is needed in the marketplace and sw believes that alternative is stevia sw seed company is capitalizing on these three very important trends to help farmers combat the challenges of today while keeping an eye on providing sustainable solutions for tomorrow   mission sw’s vision is to be the world’s preferred proprietary seed company which supplies a range of forage grain and specialty crop products that supports the growing global demand for animal proteins and healthier consumer diets   history of sw seed co more than  years ago a group of cattleman were looking to develop the very best alfalfa hay forage for their herd they enlisted the expertise of the leading breeders and agronomist to develop varieties that would provide superior traits while maximizing yield since  sw’s breeders have developed the leading university verified nondormant alfalfa seed varieties available anywhere in the world in addition due to the soil conditions around the base of the former tulare lake where much of their production took place sw developed varieties that would withstand the rigors of the highly saline conditions of the former lakes rim as farmers in the region began to recognize the capabilities of these recently developed varieties sw began selling the seed to farmers throughout the region as well as other areas of the world that had similar soil challenges such as the middle east as the original owners transitioned their ownership in the company the company elected to go public enlisting famed agronomist mark grewal to lead the company going forward since going public in  sw has dramatically opened new markets expanded acreage dedicated to the production of alfalfa and expanded its research and development focus to expand not only its nondormant varieties but dormant and biotech varieties as well the company acquired imperial valley seed in october  to expand production in the imperial valley growing region of california and in april  acquired seed genetics international expanding its production capabilities into australia with worldwide sales and distribution through both a direct sales force as well as dealerdistributors the company is dedicated to providing the world’s farmers with the very best alfalfa seed varieties to maximize their yields and profits while providing cattle and dairyman the highest quality alfalfa hay on the market just as they have for the past  years ago
