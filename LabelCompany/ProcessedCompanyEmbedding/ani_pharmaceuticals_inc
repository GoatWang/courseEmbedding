description nilutamide tablets contain nilutamide a nonsteroidal orally active antiandrogen having the chemical name dimethylnitrotrifluoromethylphenylimidazolidinedione with the following structural formulanilutamide is a microcrystalline white to practically white powder with a molecular weight of  its molecular formula is c h f n o  it is freely soluble in ethyl acetate acetone chloroform ethyl alcohol dichloromethane and methanol it is slightly soluble in water  wv at °c °f it melts between °c and °c °f and °f each nilutamide tablet contains  mg of nilutamide the inactive ingredients in nilutamide tablets include calcium stearate docusate sodium lactose povidone corn starch and talc clinical pharmacology mechanism of action prostate cancer is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to androgen ablation in animal studies nilutamide has demonstrated antiandrogenic activity without other hormonal estrogen progesterone mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid effects in vitro  nilutamide blocks the effects of testosterone at the androgen receptor level in vivo  nilutamide interacts with the androgen receptor and prevents the normal androgenic response pharmacokinetics absorption analysis of blood urine and feces samples following a single oral mg dose of  cnilutamide in patients with metastatic prostate cancer showed that the drug is rapidly and completely absorbed and that it yields high and persistent plasma concentrations distribution after absorption of the drug there is a detectable distribution phase there is moderate binding of the drug to plasma proteins and low binding to erythrocytes the binding is nonsaturable except in the case of alphaglycoprotein which makes a minor contribution to the total concentration of proteins in the plasma the results of binding studies do not indicate any effects that would cause nonlinear pharmacokinetics metabolism the results of a human metabolism study using  cradiolabelled tablets show that nilutamide is extensively metabolized and less than  of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine after  days five metabolites have been isolated from human urine two metabolites display an asymmetric center due to oxidation of a methyl group resulting in the formation of d and lisomers one of the metabolites was shown in vitro  to possess  to  of the pharmacological activity of the parent drug and the disomer of the active metabolite showed equal or greater potency compared to the lisomer however the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the metabolites have not been fully investigated elimination the majority  of orally administered  cnilutamide is eliminated in the urine during the first  hours after a single mg dose fecal elimination is negligible ranging from  to  of the dose after  to  days excretion of radioactivity in urine likely continues beyond  days the mean elimination halflife of nilutamide determined in studies in which subjects received a single dose of  to  mg ranged from  to  hours with most values between  and  hours the elimination of at least one metabolite is generally longer than that of unchanged nilutamide  to  hours during multiple dosing of  mg nilutamide given as  ×  mg twice a day steady state was reached within  to  weeks for most patients and mean steady state auc– was  higher than the auc–∞ obtained from the first  mg dose these data and in vitro metabolism data suggest that upon multiple dosing metabolic enzyme inhibition may occur for this drug clinical studies nilutamide through its antiandrogenic activity can complement surgical castration which suppresses only testicular androgens the effects of the combined therapy were studied in patients with previously untreated metastatic prostate cancer in a doubleblind randomized multicenter study that enrolled  patients  treated with orchiectomy and nilutamide tablets  treated with orchiectomy and placebo the nilutamide tablets group showed a statistically significant benefit in time to progression and time to death the results are summarized below nilutamidetablets placebo median survival months   progressionfree survival months   complete or partial regression   improvement in bone pain   indications and usage metastatic prostate cancer nilutamide tablets are indicated for use in combination with surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer stage d  for maximum benefit treatment with nilutamide tablets must begin on the same day as or on the day after surgical castration contraindications nilutamide tablets are contraindicated • in patients with severe hepatic impairment baseline hepatic enzymes should be evaluated prior to treatment • in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency • in patients with hypersensitivity to nilutamide or any component of this preparation warnings interstitial pneumonitis interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in  of patients in controlled clinical trials in patients exposed to nilutamide a small study in japanese subjects showed that  of  patients  developed interstitial pneumonitis reports of interstitial changes including pulmonary fibrosis that led to hospitalization and death have been reported rarely postmarketing symptoms included exertional dyspnea cough chest pain and fever xrays showed interstitial or alveolointerstitial changes and pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive pattern with decreased dlco most cases occurred within the first  months of treatment with nilutamide tablets and most reversed with discontinuation of therapy a routine chest xray should be performed prior to initiating treatment with nilutamide tablets baseline pulmonary function tests may be considered patients should be instructed to report any new or worsening shortness of breath that they experience while on nilutamide tablets if symptoms occur nilutamide tablets should be immediately discontinued until it can be determined if the symptoms are drug related hepatitis rare cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury have been reported postmarketing in association with the use of nilutamide tablets hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first  to  months of treatment hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in  of nilutamide tablet patients in controlled clinical trials serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with nilutamide tablets at regular intervals for the first  months of treatment and periodically thereafter liver function tests should also be obtained at the first sign or symptom suggestive of liver dysfunction eg nausea vomiting abdominal pain fatigue anorexia “flulike” symptoms dark urine jaundice or right upper quadrant tenderness if at any time a patient has jaundice or their alt rises above  times the upper limit of normal nilutamide tablets should be immediately discontinued with close followup of liver function tests until resolution use in women nilutamide tablets have no indication for women and should not be used in this population particularly for nonserious or nonlife threatening conditions other foreign postmarketing surveillance has revealed isolated cases of aplastic anemia in which a causal relationship with nilutamide tablets could not be ascertained precautions general antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome patients whose disease progresses while being treated with an antiandrogen may experience clinical improvement with discontinuation of the antiandrogen information for patients patients should be informed that nilutamide tablets should be started on the day of or on the day after surgical castration they should also be informed that they should not interrupt their dosing of nilutamide tablets or stop taking this medication without consulting their physician because of the possibility of interstitial pneumonitis patients should also be told to report immediately any dyspnea or aggravation of preexisting dyspnea because of the possibility of hepatitis patients should be told to consult with their physician should nausea vomiting abdominal pain or jaundice occur because of the possibility of an intolerance to alcohol facial flushes malaise hypotension following ingestion of nilutamide tablets it is recommended that intake of alcoholic beverages be avoided by patients who experience this reaction this effect has been reported in about  of patients treated with nilutamide tablets in clinical trials  to  of patients receiving nilutamide tablets reported a delay in adaptation to dark ranging from seconds to a few minutes when passing from a lighted area to a dark area this effect sometimes does not abate as drug treatment is continued patients who experience this effect should be cautioned about driving at night or through tunnels this effect can be alleviated by the wearing of tinted glasses drug interactions in vitro  nilutamide has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome p isoenzymes and therefore may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems consequently drugs with a low therapeutic margin such as vitamin k antagonists phenytoin and theophylline could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum halflife leading to a toxic level the dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with nilutamide for example when vitamin k antagonists are administered concomitantly with nilutamide prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary the dosage of vitamin k antagonists should be reduced carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility administration of nilutamide to rats for  months at doses of    or  mgkgday produced benign leydig cell tumors in  of the highdose male rats auc exposures in highdose rats were approximately  to  times human auc exposures with therapeutic doses the increased incidence of leydig cell tumors is secondary to elevated luteinizing hormone lh concentrations resulting from loss of feedback inhibition at the pituitary elevated lh and testosterone concentrations are not observed in castrated men receiving nilutamide tablets nilutamide had no effect on the incidence size or time of onset of any spontaneous tumor in rats nilutamide displayed no mutagenic effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo tests ames test mouse micronucleus test and two chromosomal aberration tests in reproduction studies in rats nilutamide had no effect on the reproductive function of males and females and no lethal teratogenic or growthsuppressive effects on fetuses were found the maximal dose at which nilutamide did not affect reproductive function in either sex or have an effect on fetuses was estimated to be  mgkg orally auc exposures in rats approximately  to  times human therapeutic auc exposures pregnancy animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nilutamide it is also not known whether nilutamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity nilutamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed pediatric use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been determined animal pharmacology and toxicology administration of nilutamide tablets to beagle dogs resulted in drugrelated deaths at dose levels that produce auc exposures in dogs much lower than the auc exposures of men receiving the therapeutic doses of  and  mgday nilutamideinduced toxicity in dogs was cumulative with progressively lower doses producing death when given for longer durations nilutamide given to dogs at  mgkgday  to  times human auc exposure for  month produced  mortality administration of  and  mgkgday nilutamide  to  times human auc exposure for  months resulted in  and  mortality in treated dogs administration to dogs of   and  mgkgday nilutamide  to  human auc exposure for  year resulted in   and  mortality respectively a “noeffect level” for nilutamideinduced mortality in dogs was not identified pathology data from the oneyear oral toxicity study suggest that the deaths in dogs were secondary to liver toxicity markedtomassive hepatocellular swelling and vacuolization were observed in affected dogs liver toxicity in dogs was not consistently associated with elevations of liver enzymes administration of nilutamide to rats at a dose level of  mgkgday auc exposure in rats  to  times human therapeutic auc exposures for  months increased the incidence of lung pathology granulomatous inflammation and chronic alveolitis the hepatic and pulmonary adverse effects observed in nilutamidetreated animals and men are similar to effects observed with another

tincture oxycodone capsules oxycodone oral solution propafenone propranolol er vancomycin we consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop all of which influence the level of competition upon product launch these criteria include � formulation complexity our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce including highly potent extended release combination and low dosage products this ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture � patent status we seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have longterm patent protection or existing patent challenges � market size when determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing we endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our product both competitively and at a profit � profit potential we research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire in determining the potential profit of a product we forecast our anticipated market share pricing including the expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers and the estimated cost to manufacture the products � manufacturing we generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to maximize the capacity and utilization of our facilities ensure quality control in our products and maximize profit potential � competition when determining whether to develop or acquire a product we research the existing and expected competition we seek to develop products for which we can obtain a sufficient market share and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets such as hormone therapies in which fewer generic companies are able to compete recent developments in february  we acquired from cranford pharmaceuticals llc the

policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the fdas september  compliance policy guide sec  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or abbreviated new drug applications andas under this policy the fda has stated that it will follow a riskbased approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a casebycase basis but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness while we believe that so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards the fda will not take action against us under the current enforcement policy we can offer no assurances that the fda will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products our combined net revenues for these products for the three months ended march   and  were  million and  million respectively � net revenues for branded pharmaceutical products were  million during the three months ended march   an increase of  compared to  million for the same period in  the primary reason for the increase was sales of inderal la which was launched in the second quarter of  as well as sales of inderal xl and innopran xl both of which were launched in first quarter of  the increase was partially offset by decreased unit sales for lithobid and vancocin we experience periodic larger orders for our vancocin product that relate to clinical trials such orders constituted  million of our branded pharmaceutical product revenue for the three months ended march   we had no such orders in the three months ended march   and we cannot be sure that such purchases will occur in future periods � contract manufacturing revenues were  million during the three months ended march   an increase of  compared to  million for the same period in  due to timing of orders from contract manufacturing customers in the period as described in note  commitments and contingencies in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements

group of unapproved products for the three months ended march   and  were  million and  million respectively � contract services and other income were  million during the three months ended march   a decrease of  from  million for the same period in  due primarily to the lack of royalties related to sales of fenofibrate the authorized generic of lipofenr the marketing and distribution rights to

innopran xl and inderal la inventory sold during the period a trend which will continue until such time that the inventory as components of the inderal xl innopran xl and inderal la asset purchases are consumed we source the raw materials for our products including active pharmaceutical ingredients api from both domestic and international suppliers generally only a single source of api is qualified for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate a second source of supply changes in api suppliers usually must be approved by the fda which can take  months or longer as a result we are dependent upon our current vendors to reliably supply the api required for ongoing product manufacturing in addition certain of our api for our drug products including those that are marketed without approved ndas or andas are sourced from international suppliers from time to time we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported apis due to fda inspections during the three months ended march   we purchased  of our inventory exclusive of inventory acquired in asset purchases as described in note  fair value disclosures in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i item  of this form q quarterly report from two suppliers as of march   the amounts payable to these suppliers were immaterial in the three months ended march   we purchased approximately  of our inventory from three suppliers in order to manufacture opium tincture oxycodone capsules and oxycodone oral solution we must receive approval from the drug enforcement agency dea for a quota to purchase the amount of opium and oxycodone needed to manufacture the respective products without approved quotas from the dea we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers as a result we are dependent upon the dea to annually approve a sufficient quota of api to support our continued manufacture of opium tincture

of the following factors � research and development expenses increased from  million to  million an increase of  due to timing of work on development projects primarily the corticotropin recommercialization project current projects also include work on the andas purchased in  and  as well as collaborations with partners we anticipate that research and development costs will continue to be greater in  than in  in support of our strategy to expand our product portfolio and as we continue to focus on the development of our corticotropin products � selling general and administrative expenses increased from  million to  million an increase of  primarily due to increased stockbased compensation expense increases in personnel and related costs and  million of expenses related to a proposed transaction that we ultimately decided not to pursue further we anticipate that selling general and administrative expenses will continue to be greater in  than in  as we support anticipated additional revenue growth � depreciation and amortization increased from  million to  million an increase of  due primarily to the amortization of the rights title and interest in the nda for inderal

in temporary and estimated permanent differences and excludes certain discrete items whose tax effect is recognized in the interim period in which they occur these changes in temporary differences permanent differences and discrete items result in variances to the effective tax rate from period to period we also have elected to exclude the impacts from significant pretax nonrecognized subsequent events from our interim estimated annual effective rate until the period in which they occur our estimated annual effective tax rate changes throughout the year as our ongoing estimates of pretax income changes in temporary differences and permanent differences are revised and as discrete items occur for the three months ended march   we recognized income tax expense of  million versus  million for the same period in  a decrease of  million the effective tax rate for the three months ended march   was  of pretax income reported in the period calculated based on the estimated annual effective rate anticipated for the year ending december   plus the effects of certain discrete items occurring in the first quarter our effective tax rate for the three months ended march   was impacted primarily by the domestic production activities deduction as well as the discrete impact of current period awards of stockbased compensation stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options all of which impact the consolidated effective rate in the period in which they occur the  effective tax rate for the three months ended march   was primarily driven by permanent differences related to our international tax structure surrounding our corticotropin ndas which resulted in significant nondeductible amortization and interest expense in  we expect that our effective tax rate for  may continue to be lower than in  as a result of the dissolution of the international tax structure surrounding our corticotropin ndas liquidity and capital

glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are
