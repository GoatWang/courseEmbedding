the members of the business council because schedule demands on senior business executives are extensive the council provides an especially valuable opportunity to discuss major subjects in a broader ranging forum than is normally available in the course of business activities as part of its process the council invites leaders in government politics academia science medicine technology and other sectors to address the council and to participate in its discussions council members hope that these discussions result in better understanding by their invited guests as well as by the members themselves today the council meets three times a year in a collegial atmosphere to share and explore ideasas a gathering of peers from many fields the council is entirely an educational and

chantilly va united states  bilderberg meeting the th bilderberg meeting will be held in chantilly virginia usa from  may   june  the conference will deal mainly with political economic and societal issues like transatlantic relations evolution of the political landscape in europe and the us austerity and growth in developed economies cyber security energy challenges the future of democracy russia china and the middle east approximately  participants will attend of whom about twothirds come from europe and the balance from north america and other countries about onethird is from government and politics and twothirds are from finance industry labor education and communications the meeting is private in order to encourage frank and open discussion bilderberg takes its name from the hotel in holland where the first meeting took place in may  that pioneering meeting grew out of the concern expressed by leading citizens on both sides of the atlantic that western europe and north america were not working together as closely as they should on common problems of critical importance it was felt that regular offtherecord discussions would help create a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting western nations in the difficult postwar period the cold war has now ended but in practically all respects there are more not fewer common problems  from trade to jobs from monetary policy to investment from ecological challenges to the task of promoting international security it is hard to think of any major issue in either europe or north america whose unilateral solution would not have repercussions for the other thus the concept of a europeanamerican forum has not been overtaken by time the dialogue between these two regions is still  even increasingly  critical what is unique about bilderberg as a forum is the broad crosssection of leading citizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and offtherecord discussion about topics of current concern especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international economy the strong feeling among participants that in view of the differing attitudes and experiences of the western nations there remains a clear need to further develop an understanding in which these concerns can be accommodated the privacy of the meetings which has no purpose other than to allow participants to speak their minds openly and freely in short bilderberg is a small flexible informal and offtherecord international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced bilderbergs only activity is its annual conference at the meetings no resolutions are proposed no votes taken and no policy statements issued since  fiftynine conferences have been held the names of the participants are made available to the press participants are chosen for their experience their knowledge and their standing all participants attend bilderberg in a private and not an official capacity attendee davos switzerland  world economic forum annual meeting the first annual meeting of the second decade of the st century opened amid an atmosphere of microoptimism
