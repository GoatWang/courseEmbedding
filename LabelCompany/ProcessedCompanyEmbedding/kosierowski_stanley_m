new jersey resources  connecttweetlinkedincommentemailmoreyou may not know this but wallbased new jersey resources the parent company of new jersey natural gas is not just about natural gasit is in the electric business as well and not the traditional electric businessthrough its unregulated subsidiary njr clean energy ventures the company has installed solar panels on more than  homes in  of new jerseys  counties making it the states thirdlargest residential solar provider when you add in  commercial solar projects including a massive solar farm in east windsor the largest in the western hemisphere new jersey resources has invested almost  million in solar energy in the garden stateeditorial energy future blowing in the windit has helped us achieve the goal of providing electric service said laurence m downes new jersey resources chairman and chief executive officernew breezenow njr clean energy ventures is in the midst of a new adventure wind power in june the company announced that it has completed its first wind farm a  million acre project named the two dot wind farm located in two dot montanathis spring wind turbines at the  million carroll area wind farm in carroll county iowa the companys second project are expected to start turning electricity from the wind farm will be sold to midamerican energy iowas largest energy company which serves about  electric customers in iowa illinois and south dakotalater in the fall the kansas city board of public utilities and yahoo inc are expected to begin purchasing power from the  million alexander wind farm the companys third farm planned for  acres of land in rush county kansaswhy is nj natural gas cutting bills by downes and stanley m kosierowski president of njr clean energy ventures recently sat down to talk about the companys foray into solar and wind power their answers which were edited are belowbuy photo photo tanya breenstaff photographerhow did the company get into thisdownes this goes back to the late s we started out trying to look at ways that we can provide customers with an electric product back in  we entered into an alliance with general electric for the sale of plug power fuel cells the idea was to have a utility that used natural gas to produce electricity for our residential customers ultimately it didnt work because the product was not commercial for residential customersabout  years later we offered customers that opportunity to use solar to save money on their electric bills and we grew from therehow does the solar program called sunlight advantage workdownes the company working with contractors installs solar panels on a houses roof which the customer leases for  a month saving about  a month on the electric bill the company receives a federal investment tax credit the solar renewable energy certificates which represents the financial value of the environmental benefits created by the solar power and the homeowners monthly paymentwhat about wind powerdownes we are very focused on the types of projects that make sense for us we are not in the offshore wind market that doesnt fit in with the overall type of investment we want to make well do projects in states where there is a renewable portfolio standard and where we can get a longterm power purchase agreement for the sale of the output from the project a renewable portfolio standard requires the increased production of energy from sources such as solar and windwe want to focus on the midsize onshore project there are large players in wind right now thats not what were looking for those massive projectskosierowski as we look at our whole strategy whether its wind or solar it is really to get power sources close to where it is being utilized the more we do that it really takes away the necessity the imperative for long transmission lines photo courtesy new jersey resourcesis there an effect on customers of new jersey natural gasdownes this is not in utility billsupper freehold board will not support new gas pipelineis new jersey resources changing its focusdownes the goal is not to turn new jersey resources into a clean energy company the goal is to have clean energy play a part in the overall companys performance but new jersey natural gas co will continue to be the largest piece the regulated assets are our main investment and that will not changelastly how about a wind farm in new jerseydownes if we had the opportunity to do onshore wind in new jersey we would do that but the wind patterns in new jersey are such that that will not work we considered
