prime video ryan lizza amber rose answers best answer  short answer  standard deviation your concept is correct – here is more detail walter shewhart was the first person to develop something called control charts in the s which utilize plusminus six standard deviations from the mean of a group population of numbers thus you could call this plus and minus three sigma  or six sigma however the term six sigma was first utilized by motorola as a marketing ploy in helping them win the malcolm baldrige national quality award in  as part of winning the award all awardees must be open to presenting best practices to anyone who asks and the term six sigma was born it did not become popular until the mids after ge become successful in applying the motorola methodology and integrating six sigma into their own existing processes the all but forgotten fact is that back in  motorola was actually using the shewhart definition of plus and minus three standard deviations which was rejected by ford motor company in the early s because using that definition did not meet the requirements for the automotive industry which wasis plusminus four standard deviations for ongoing production products and plusminus five standard deviations for prototype products it wasnt until the late s that the term six sigma came to represent plusminus six standard deviations which it still means today however even this is not totally true as the six sigma proponents use a variation shifting factor calculation that reduces the theoretical value to something less than the true value of six standard deviations sources httpwwwasqorg httpwwwnistgov i lived this history and was the guy at ford who rejected the motorola process in the early s as well as being the training director for

direction in which future developments may be expected to take place could he have forseen its enormous impact this monumental work laid the foundation for this modern quality control discipline and it remains as current today as ever it began as an attempt to develop a scientific basis for attaining economic control of quality through the establishment of control limits to indicate when the quality of product is varying more than is economically desirable in his search for better knowledge of economy in manufacture shewhart touches upon all aspects of statistical quality control the book includes a presentation of the fundamental concepts and advantages of statistical control ways of expressing quality of product a section containing a discourse that has been described as a masterpiece on the meaning of quality the basis for specification of quality control sampling fluctuations in quality allowable variability in quality which contains the first fully developed use of control charts and quality control in practice this is required reading for anyone seriously interested in the study of quality control about the author the father of modern quality control walter a shewhart brought together the disciplines of statistics engineering and economics in a simple but highly effective tool the control chart this technique and the principles behind it have played key roles in economic developments from the s through to the present day most of shewharts professional career was spent at western electric as an engineer from  to  and at bell telephone laboratories from  until his retirement in  in addition he served for more than  years as the first editor of the mathematical statistics series published by john wiley  sons o que estão dizendo  escrever uma

niccolo guicciardini chapter  – walter andrew shewhart economic control of quality of manufactured product denis bayartavailable online  may publisher summarythis chapter deals with walter andrew shewarts book economic control of quality of manufactured product in this book shewhart brought together many of the statistical principles of industrial quality control this book is the first publication to deal specifically with the control of industrial manufacturing processes by means of mathematical statistics shewhart studied the variability of physical quantities by regarding it as a property of the system of production and by representing it as a statistical distribution whose parameters could be estimated but for such a hypothesis to be valid it is necessary that a system of production be in a stable state which shewhart conceptualized under the name of “constant system of chance causes” the contents of shewharts book consist of  chapters divided into seven parts and three appendices the touchstone of shewharts method the first type is that where the “standard” of quality is given in advance in the specification in statistical form the second type of situation is much more interesting and innovative bringing the system into a state of maximum control of a kind where the norm is a property of the system itself and not just grafted on the reception of the book was initially limited the publication of shewharts book concerned only statisticians and some specialists however it was the economic regime of the war that ensured the wide dissemination of the statistical control of quality in industry both in the united states and in great britain under the impetus of governments who saw in it the technical and economic advantages of rationalizing

walter shewhart was a giant among giants in the quality movement during the first half of the th century his mentoring of other engineers at western electric and his groundbreaking work with control charts arguably led a quality revolution and launched the quality professionbackgroundwalter andrew shewhart was born to anton and esta barney shewhart on march   in new canton il shewhart died on march   in troy hills nj he attended the university of illinois receiving bachelor’s and master’s degrees in  he married edna hart and moved to california where he earned his doctoral degree in physics while studying as a whiting fellow at the university of california berkeley in  he had brief stints of teaching at university of illinois university of california at berkeley and la crosse state teachers college renamed wisconsin state university but his academic career was shortlivedin  shewhart joined the inspection engineering department of the western electric co in hawthorne il western electric manufactured telephone hardware for bell telephone co although no one could have realized it at the time shewhart would alter the course of industrial history shewhart was part of a group of people who were all destined to become famous in their time this group included harold dodge and harry romig known for their work on product sampling plans george d edwards who became the first president of the american society for quality control renamed american society for quality in  was shewhart’s supervisor shewhart mentored many during his tenure including joseph m juran during the summers of  and  w edwards deming worked as an intern at the hawthorne il plant where he became interested in shewhart’s work shewharts contributionengineers at bell telephone had been working to improve the reliability of their transmissions systems business dictated a need to reduce the frequency of failures and repairs to their amplifiers connectors and other equipment that were buried underground bell telephone had already realized that reducing variation in manufacturing processes would have a positive impact on repair costs at the same time the company determined that continual adjustments in process parameters reacting to nonconformances resulted in increased variation and a degradation of quality bell telephone’s discoveries in product variation resulted in the institution of an inspection program ensuring specification and quality standards to avoid sending defective products to customers even though this program was somewhat effective it was very costly to deal with inspecting and sorting of finished goods by  shewhart determined the problem of variability in terms of assignable cause and chance cause deming referred to this as common cause on may   shewhart prepared a memorandum of less than one page in length and forwarded it to his manager george edwards about  of the page was devoted to a simple diagram that we would today recognize as a control chart this memorandum set forth the essential principles and considerations that became known as process quality control shewhart’s principle was that bringing a process into a state of statistical control would allow the distinction between assignable and chance cause variations by keeping the process in control it would be possible to predict future output and to economically manage processes this was the birth of the modern scientific study of process control spc moves mainstreamat its creation in  shewhart moved to the bell telephone laboratories working to advance his theories and to bring together the disciplines of statistics engineering and economics in  he published a book “economic control of quality of manufactured product” it challenged the inspectionbased approach to quality and introduced the modern era of quality management up until this time statistical process control was largely a bell telephone quality tool shewhart’s book popularized statistical control and its use then spread throughout industry from the s forward shewhart’s interests expanded from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference in  w edwards deming and another physicist raymond t birge published a paper on measurement error in science however after collaboration with shewhart they recast their approach and launched a long collaboration between shewhart and deming shewhart’s charts were adopted by the american society for testing materials astm in  shewhart and deming impacted the improvement of production material during world war ii in american war standards z z and z frequently he was called upon as a consultant to the us war department the united nations and the government of india deming continued to champion shewhart’s ideas methodologies and theories throughout his career while working with japan deming further developed some of shewhart’s methodological proposals of scientific interference which had been named the shewhart cycle and was represented by the plandocheckact elements shewhart lectured extensively on the subjects of quality control and applied statistics in india at the university of london at stevens institute of technology and at the graduate schools of the us department of agriculture he also was a member of many societies and governmental agencies during the s shewhart’s work was rediscovered by a third generation of industrial engineers and managers and this time it was repackaged and incorporated into the six sigma approachshewhart received many honors and awards that include holley medal of the american society of mechanical engineers asq’s st honorary member founding member and fellow of the institute of mathematical statistics fellow of the american statistical association fellow of the international statistical institute fellow of the royal society of mechanical engineers shewhart believed that statistical theory should serve the needs of industry and society as a whole he challenged the norms of his day and showed manufacturers the better way that revolutionized industry upon his death in  there were a multitude of commentaries from many contributors who were themselves important figures in the development of the quality field an excerpt from a speech by the chairman of the committee that awarded the first asq shewhart medal captured shewhart’s character in the following“shewhart’s legacy lives in mementos of hima simple bowl and some numbered chips a bronze medal some books and writings it lives in the succession of other prominent individuals he influenced and it lives in the society of professionals who carry on the work he started” did you enjoy this article click here to subscribe to quality magazine  recent articles by jim smith the role
