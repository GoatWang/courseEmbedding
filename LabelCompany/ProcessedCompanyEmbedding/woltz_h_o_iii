to the insteel industries third quarter  conference call at this time all participants are in listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will follow that time operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded now i would like to turn the call over to h woltz president and ceo of insteel industries mr woltz you may begin ho woltz iii thank you kevin good morning thank you for your interest in insteel and welcome to our third quarter  conference call which will be conducted by mike gazmarian our vice president cfo and treasurer and me before we begin let me remind you that some of the comments made on todays call are considered to be forwardlooking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected these risk factors are described in our periodic filings with the sec all forwardlooking statements are based on our current expectations and information that is currently available we do not assume any obligation to update these statements in the future to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or new information ill now turn the call over to mike to review our third quarter financial results and the macro indicators for our construction end markets then ill followup to comment more on market conditions and our business outlook michael gazmarian thank you h as we reported earlier this morning insteel posted strong results for the third quarter of fiscal  with net earnings rising to  million or  per diluted share from  million or  a share in the second quarter and  million or  a share in the prior year quarter excluding a net gain from insurance proceeds related to the fire at our gallatin manufacturing facility net earnings for the third quarter were  million or  per diluted share the highest level since fiscal  before the onset of the recession in the nonresidential construction sector net sales for the quarter rose  from last year to a record high of  million driven by  increase in shipments which also reached an all time high and a  increase in average selling prices the previous highs however were not on a comparable basis as they were achieved prior to our november  acquisition of ivy steel  wire since ivy was generating over  million of revenues on a standalone basis in  our pro forma combined revenues were approaching  million which is still significantly higher than our current run rate although demand in our markets remains well under prerecession levels we are encouraged by the continued recovery in shipments which have now risen yearoveryear for five consecutive quarters and in seven of the previous eight quarters on a sequential basis net sales were up  from the second quarter on a  increase in shipments partially offset by a  reduction in average selling prices driven by a less favorable product mix relative to q gross profit for the quarter improved to  million from  million a year ago with gross margins widening  basis points to  from  due to the increase in shipment higher spreads between selling prices and raw material costs and lower unit conversion costs and higher operating volumes relative to the prior year quarter our overall capacity utilization for the quarter improved to  its highest level since  the gallatin fire and insurance claim did not impact our operating costs for the quarter or the nine month period as the out of pocket expenses recorded in cost of sales and sga expense were offset by insurance proceeds other income for the quarter includes net gain that i alluded to earlier of  million representing the excess of the insurance proceeds attributable to the replacement of property and equipment over the carrying value of the assets that were destroyed in the fire sga expense for the quarter rose  million from a year ago primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense driven by our improved results partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies our effective income tax rate for the quarter fell to  versus  in the prior year primarily due to changes in permanent tax differences going forward our effective rate will continue to be subject to fluctuations based upon the level of future earnings changes in permanent tax differences and adjustments to the other assumptions and estimates entering into the tax provision calculation moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet cash provided by operating activities improved to  million for the quarter due to  million of cash provided by net working capital and the increase in earnings accounts receivable rose  million driven by the sequential increase in sales inventories rose  million and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased  million largely due to higher raw material purchases and higher proportion of import receipts during the quarter our inventory position at the end of q represented about  months of shipment on a forwardlooking basis calculated off of forecasted shipments for the fourth quarter capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year totaled  million which includes  million of outlays related to the gallatin fire we have scaled down our capex estimate for the year to less than  million excluding the firerelated outlays largely due to changes in the anticipated timing of certain payments previously forecasted for q into early next year we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand up  million from the previous quarter and no borrowings outstanding under  million revolving credit facility providing us with plenty of liquidity as we move into the last quarter of our fiscal year the macro indicators for our construction end markets are reflecting continued improvement after dropping into negative territory for two straight months the architectural billings index moved back into positive territory in may rebounding to  it has now remained above the  growth threshold for  of the previous  months its longest positive streak since  implying increased construction spending for nonresidential buildings in the coming months private nonresidential construction spending through the first five months of the year was up  from last year and a seasonally adjusted annual rate has now risen yearoveryear for  straight months and at a double digit rate over the past five months public construction spending however has remained relatively weak on an overall basis the may  yeartodate total fell about a percent from last year although the highway and street and transportation carryovers were up around  the outlook for federal transportation infrastructure construction spending continues to be clouded by uncertainty in view of the upcoming expiration of the current map funding authorization in september and recent forecasts indicating that the federal highway trust fund could be depleted by the end of august as we had anticipated on our last call it now appears likely that a short term extension will be enacted that provides additional time for the development of a longer term funding plan you may recall that following the expiration in the previous safetealu highway bill in september  a series of nine short term extensions were required before map was enacted almost three years later in july  although the limited duration of the extension is likely to be passed as disappointing we are encouraged by the increased dialog in washington regarding longer term funding solutions particularly the bipartisan corkermurphy proposal which had increase the gas and diesel tax by  over a two year period and then index the taxes to inflation the resulting revenue infusion has been estimated to range from  billion to over  billion over a year period which would be sufficient to offset the anticipated shortfall in the highway trust fund that has required over  billion of transfers from the general fund of the treasury since  i will now turn the call back over to h michael gazmarian thank you mike as reflected in our release and in mikes comments we are encouraged by the continued improvement in market conditions during the third quarter these favorable trends are largely consistent with the various macroindicators and forecasts for the construction sector and our previously stated view that demand for our reinforcing product should improve over the next few quarters while our capacity utilization improved to  in q it remains depressed on an absolute basis relative to prerecession levels and we suspect that competitors are operating at comparable rates taken together slow growth capacity additions by certain competitors and concerns about the resilience of the construction recovery have contributed to highly competitive pricing environment that prevails in our markets we expect that these conditions will persist until there are further meaningful improvements in demand with that said the pricing environment during our third quarter was relatively stable reflecting growing demand for reinforcing products and lower volatility in pricing for our principal raw material hot rolled wire rod contributing to the more stable pricing environment has then reduced volatility in the steel scrap markets which have traded at a narrow range over the past few months we welcome the stability and would like to see it continue ultimately we would expect to see the opportunity to expand margins as market conditions continue to improve and capacity utilization rates rise providing the industry with the opportunity to sell more selectively as we reported previously last january a group of domestic wire rod producers filed antidumping and countervailing duty cases against china which has been the primary source of imported wire rod to the us market for the last two years on july  the department of commerce published its preliminary determination in the cbd case indicating subsidy rates between  and  commerce is scheduled to make its preliminary determination in the antidumping case on august  we expect that the antidumping duties will be substantial and that domestic producers will prevail in their injury argument causing china to exit the us wire rod market final determinations in the cases are expected some time between november and january in anticipation of successful chinese trade cases we elevated our import purchases and inventory levels to bridge the transition from china to other offshore sources for the portion of our material requirement that is imported which can vary depending on market conditions from about  to  in assessing the attractiveness of offshore purchases we consider the working capital implications and pricing exposure that are inherent due to the longer lead times and larger order quantities relative to domestic purchases predictably other foreign sources have replaced chinese producers and we expect a continuation of ample availability transaction prices for imported material have risen by approximately  per ton implying the need for us to increase selling prices for our product lines that consumer foreign rod in order to avoid margin compression and that process is currently underway although its too soon to comment on the likelihood that we will recover these additional costs cyclical and seasonal factors cause us to be optimistic mike mentioned that we scaled down our capex forecast due to timing issues associated with payments for machinery commitments going forward capex will continue to be focused on maintaining our facilities and our information systems infrastructure expanding capacity where warranted improving quality and reducing operating costs we continue to view maintenance capex in the range of  million to  million annually finally mike touched on the financial impact of the fire that we experienced in january at the gallatin tennessee pc strand facility the repair work on the facility is approximately  complete and we continue to expect the startup of the reconstructed cleaning operation will occur during the fourth fiscal quarter our people working in cooperation with the responsive group of outside tool processors have done an excellent job of making this unfortunate incident a nonevent for our customers to summarize the recovery in nonresidential construction markets has accelerated somewhat resulting in an uptick in our capacity utilization rate although the market environment remains highly competitive our most immediate external concern relates to the looming crisis with the federal highway trust fund an unfavorable outcome for discussions to shore up federal infrastructure funding to begin negatively impacting certain insteel customers late in the first fiscal quarter or early in second fiscal quarter of  consistent with prior periods we will continue to focus on achieving further improvements in the effectiveness of our manufacturing operations and identifying additional opportunities to broaden our product offering and grow through acquisition this concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions kevin would you please explain the procedure for asking questions questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions and our first question comes from tim moore of rutabaga capital your line is now open tim moore  rutabaga capital yes thank you appreciate it congratulations on the quarters top line growth acceleration and the nice rise in utilization but i was just wondering you know with so much net cash now and your untapped revolver as well as interest rates low can you kind of may be share with us if you give me consideration to may be doing a buyback and how you weight that against maybe a strategic tuckon acquisition ho woltz iii our view on that is consistent with past periods where we view the number one objective of the company for use of its resources to be finding growth opportunities going forward once we believe that we have adequate liquidity to accommodate those as you know we have a buyback resolution in place we also have a history of returning cash to shareholders through special dividends as warranted so i dont think the companys position has changed at all those are the priorities or the continuing priorities and i think you can expect us to act in the future as we have in the past on those issues tim moore  rutabaga capital great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from tyson bauer of kc capital your line is now open tyson bauer  kc capital good job gentlemen and hopefully better quarters ahead ho woltz iii thanks tyson tyson bauer  kc capital couple of quick questions we talked about the private there or nonpublic activity in the construction site do you have a sense of any pockets of greater strength and others maybe on the commercial or institutional or industrial segments that youve seen a greater benefit given the location of your manufacturing facilities ho woltz iii i would say that disparity is more geographic than by construction and i dont know that we have tremendous visibility into each construction segment except for the data thats department of commerce oriented geographically we continue to see texas and the surrounding areas as the strongest market but recovery elsewhere as well tyson bauer  kc capital okay nice segue with texas you mentioned that in your answer we are seeing more states independently not  basically counting on the federal government to provide funding for infrastructure needs and doing special activities raising funds doing their own bills that are more state oriented and so looking for matching federal funds they seem to be the leader in the country of doing that you are ideally located in texas is that going to be a growing theme if the best that we are hoping for on the federal policy is just to maintain previous spending levels and they may do add on bills there specific to bridges or otherwise but the general highway funding seems to be best case scenario just maintaining will we see a greater percentage then going on to the states and the local municipalities to meet their infrastructure needs ho woltz iii yes i mean we would expect that to be an ongoing theme where there has been a lot of situations and then the states really dont have a choice because they can no longer defer certain outlays so youre seeing a lot of alternative approaches being pursued to raise revenues through the various means and to the extent there is continued uncertainty at the federal level we expect the states will get more aggressive tyson bauer  kc capital we are also seeing a trend in the oilenergy markets having to provide funding for states as they use the infrastructure for a lot of their trucking needs in fracking operations and otherwise is that a pocket of strength that youre also participating in ho woltz iii we believe we are benefiting from that but its difficult for us to get that granular and pinpoint like how much demand or consumption is driven by that specifically michael gazmarian tyson i am sure youve read about some of the mega chemical projects that are underway in the shale oil geographies and those facilities do require a lot of underground infrastructure that consume our products so to the extent that those facilities wouldnt be built or indiscernible for the fracking and the shale oil phenomenon then we are definitely benefiting although its impossible to quantify tyson bauer  kc capital okay the higher shipments you had in the quarter obviously have a seasonal benefit there did you see any outsize increase because we had the weather situation earlier in the year or do you think what you saw was really reflective of the industry gaining some momentum and thats what we should continue to see as we go forward ho woltz iii yeah that sequential shipment increase of  thats significantly higher than what we would typically experience so it is a combination of factors whether there is definitely some effect from pentup demand due to the adverse weather in the previous quarter but the increase was above and beyond that reflecting continued improvement in activity tyson bauer  kc capital okay last question you talked about some of the industrial the chemical plants some of the other growth areas are you seeing a better adoption rate and better reception to your esm product line and do you think that will facilitate better margins as we go forward michael gazmarian yeah we continue to make good progress with state dots and individual customers to adopt esm as alternative means of reinforcing and we expect growth out of that sector and id say we are proceeding on the expected schedule tyson bauer  kc capital sounds great thanks a lot gentleman operator thank you operator instructions and we do have a question from jon evans of jwest your line is now open jonathan evans  jwest i am sorry this may be a silly question but especially in texas it seems like the cement companies and the readymix guys are getting pretty aggressive on pricing and start to push pricing does that give you any ability to have cover to push price for your product in texas as opposed to other markets or could you give us any insights into that michael gazmarian i would say it doesnt really give us any color i think the same market for us is that are allowing the cement related industries to raise prices are positively affecting our business but there is no direct linkage so i would take that as a positive underlying fundamental of the market but i wouldnt infer anything about our ability to price our product from it jonathan evans  jwest and then just relative to spreads i mean with what you see relative to scrap pricing would you think spreads get better in q as opposed to q i mean relatively or sequentially michael gazmarian well its hard to say and we make a habit of not forecasting spreads and margins but if you go back to the comment that i made on what its going to take for us to see that opportunity to expand our margins we are really going to need to see the industry operating at better levels of capacity utilization and i think that just implies the need for continued market improvement jonathan evans  jwest got it great thank you for the answers i appreciate it michael gazmarian okay thank you operator i am not showing any further questions at this time ho woltz iii okay in that case we appreciate your interest in insteel and we look forward to

conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will follow that time operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would like to introduce your host for todays conference mr h woltz president and chief executive officer sir please begin ho woltz iii thank you michelle thank you for your interest in insteel and welcome to our fourth quarter  conference call which will be conducted by mike gazmarian our vice president cfo and treasurer and me before we begin let me remind you that some of the comments made on todays call are considered to be forwardlooking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected these risk factors are described in our periodic filings with the sec all forwardlooking statements are based on our current expectations and information that is currently available we do not assume any obligation to update these statements in the future to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or new information ill now turn the call over to mike to review our fourth quarter financial results and the macro indicators for our construction markets then followup to comment more on market conditions and our business outlook michael c gazmarian thank you h as we reported earlier this morning insteels net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal  improved to  million or  per diluted share from  million or  a share in the prior year quarter excluding the restructuring charges and acquisition costs associated with the american spring wire acquisition and a net gain from insurance proceeds related to the fire at our gallatin facility net earnings for the quarter were  million or  of diluted share the highest level for the fourth quarter in six years net sales for the quarter rose  from last year to a record high  million driven by a  increase in shipments which also reached an alltime high and a  increase in average selling prices our shipments have now risen on a yearoveryear basis for six consecutive quarters and in eight of the previous nine quarters reflecting the strengthening conditions in our construction end markets as i mentioned on our last call despite the improvement the recent highs are in no way indicative of our top line potential in a normalized construction environment as our pro forma  sales exceeded  million including the standalone revenues for asw’s pc strand business and ivy steel  wire which we acquired in november  on a sequential basis net sales rose  from the third quarter and a  percent increase in shipment and a  increase in average selling prices gross profit for the quarter improved to  million from  million a year ago with gross margins widening  basis points to  from  due to higher spreads between selling prices and raw material costs and the increase in shipments which were partially offset by higher unit converging costs related to labour inefficiencies at certain of our plants the gallatin fire and insurance claim did not impact our operating costs for the quarter or year as the out of pocket expenses recorded in cost of sales and sga expense were offset by insurance proceeds other income for the quarter includes the  million net gain that i alluded to earlier for the insurance proceeds attributed to the replacement of property and equipment destroyed in the fire for the year the net gain was  million reflecting  million of insurance proceeds plus a  million loss on the assets that were written off sga expense for the quarter rose  million from a year ago primarily due to higher compensation expenses largely incentive comp under our return on capital plan driven by our improved results together with the relative changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and higher health insurance costs our effective income tax rate for the quarter was  compared with  in the prior year and will continue to be subject to fluctuations based upon the level of future earnings changes in permanent tax differences and adjustments to the other assumptions and estimates entering into the tax provision calculation moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet cash provided by operating activities improved to  million for the quarter primarily due to the increase in earnings and the relative yearoveryear changes in network and capital which provided  million while using  million in the same period a year ago accounts receivable rose  million driven by the sequential increase in sales and the addition of asws receivables inventories increased  million also due to the asw acquisition and accounts payable on accrued expenses fell  million our inventory position at the end of the quarter represented around three months of shipments on a forwardlooking basis calculated off of forecasted shipments for the first quarter capital expenditures for the year totalled  million which included  million in outlays related to the gallatin fire we expect capex for fiscal  to be in the range of  million to  million we ended the quarter with  million cash on hand and no borrowings outstanding on our  million revolving credit facility providing us with ample liquidity as we move into fiscal  the macro indicators for our construction end markets are reflecting continued improvement through the first eight months of the year private nonresidential construction spending was up  from last year and the seasonally adjusted annual rate has risen on a yearoveryear basis for  straight months and at a doubledigit rate in seven of the last eight months after dropping into negative territory earlier in the year the architectural billings index has exceeded the  growth threshold for four straight months and  of the previous  months its longest positive streak since  another leading indicator for nonresidential building construction the dodge momentum index has reflected some moderation in recent months after a strong first half of the year but were still up  yearoveryear in september and  for the previous three months relative to the same period last year the outlook for federal infrastructure spending remains unclear in view of the shortterm stopgap measure that was enacted to extend the previous map funding bills through may we remain hopeful that the longerterm funding solutions will be developed following the november elections that facilitates the passage of a multiyear authorization providing greater certainty of funding at the state and local level i will now turn the call back over to h ho woltz iii thank you mike as reflected in our release and in mikes comments we are encouraged by the continued improvement in market conditions during the fourth quarter these favorable trends are largely consistent with the various macro indicators and forecasts for the construction sector and our previously stated view that demand for our reinforcing products should continue to improve over the next few quarters while our capacity utilization improved to  from  last year it remains depressed on an absolute basis and we suspect that competitors are operating at comparable rates taken together slow growth capacity additions by certain competitors and concerns about the resilience of the construction recovery have contributed to a highly competitive pricing environment that prevails in our markets we expect these conditions will persist until there are further meaningful improvements in demand with that said the pricing environment during our fourth quarter remained relatively stable reflecting growing demand for reinforcing products and lower volatility in the pricing for our principal raw material hotrolled wire rod ultimately we expect there will be an opportunity to expand margins as market conditions continue to improve and capacity utilization rates rise allowing producers to sell more selectively as mike mentioned we have ramped up operating hours to accommodate increased demand for our products we have experienced operating inefficiencies at certain of our facilities related to hiring training and retaining new employees improving our performance in these areas is a primary focus for us and we expect to make significant progress in the coming months as we reported previously last january a group of domestic wire rod producers filed antidumping and countervailing duty cases against china which has been the primary source of imported rod into the us market for the last two years the department of commerce published its preliminary determination in the cvd case indicating subsidy rates of between  and  in addition the department found dumping margins of up to  the final determination in the case is expected before the end of january in anticipation of chinas exit from the us market we have transitioned to other offshore sources for the portion of our raw material requirement that is imported which can vary depending on market conditions from about  to  of our total requirements in assessing the attractiveness of offshore purchases we consider the working capital implications and pricing exposure that are inherent due to longer lead times and larger order quantities relative to domestic purchases mike touched on the financial impact of the fire that we experienced in january at the tennessee pc strand facility the repair work on the facility is substantially complete and we have begun commissioning activities at the newly rebuilt unit at this point we are gradually ramping up operations and expect the facility to be self sufficient for cleaned wire rod within a few weeks i would like to reiterate my appreciation to our total processing partners and to all of the insteel team that made this unfortunate incident a nonevent for our customers as you are aware on october th i am sorry on august th we closed on the purchase of the pc strand assets of american spring wire which included production facilities in houston texas and newnan georgia the integration of these plants has proceeded smoothly and both have transitioned over to insteel information systems and operating metrics we appreciate the excellent work of our people at houston and newnan as well as our operating finance sales and is groups for their efforts in effectively executing our integration plan the addition of the houston facility provides us with a manufacturing presence in the nations most robust market for pc strand and in close proximity to both domestic and offshore raw material suppliers the houston plant is efficient despite employing antiquated ph production technology in certain portions of the operation we are in the process of firming up our investment plan for the facility to reduce this operating cost and provide additional capacity with the objective of transforming it into an ultra low cost strand producer situated in the center of the strongest consuming market in the us we will share more details about our plans in the future call turning to capex as reflected in our release we expect to invest between  million and  million in our facilities and technology infrastructure over the course of  two of the most significant projects that are under way involve cost reduction and rounding out of capacity within our standard welded wire reinforcing product line in the current quarter we’ll begin the installation of a high output production line at our pennsylvania facility that will replace obsolete technology and provide increased capacity for certain skus that have been in tight supply within our company the line is expected to be commissioned in our second quarter and it should contribute to earnings during the last half of the fiscal year our second project targeted toward cost reduction and rounding out of capacity at our florida welded wire reinforcing facility is expected to commence late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter other expenditures will be focused on maintaining our facilities improving quality lowering our operating costs and improving our technology to summarize the recovery in nonresidential construction markets is continuing although the market environment remains highly competitive consistent with prior periods we’ll continue to focus on achieving further improvements in the effectiveness of our manufacturing operations and identifying additional opportunities to broaden our product offering and grow through acquisition this concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions michelle would you please explain the procedure for asking questions questionandanswer session operator sure thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john kohler ph with oppenhiemer  close your line is open please go ahead unidentified analyst good morning gentlemen how are you today michael c gazmarian good morning well thank you john unidentified analyst great i just had two quick questions i am figuring that the asw contribution at the top line is about  million in q is that realistic i didnt know if there were production hiccups or… michael c gazmarian unfortunately it’s been similar to what we experienced on the ivy transaction just with our integration efforts and the shifting of business between locations it’s really difficult to pinpoint the exact impact but i think you can approximate it just based on their prior month run rate unidentified analyst okay great and then the last question i had was the capacity utilization includes  the  includes asw right michael c gazmarian correct unidentified analyst okay thanks a lot operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tyson bauer from kc capital your line is open please go ahead tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates nice quarter gentlemen and hopefully a better quarter as you go forward ho woltz iii thanks tyson tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates couple of quick questions you mentioned a lot of different areas that you can improve your operating things that you can control within your own facilities do you have an idea or ball park how many basis points you think you can improve just because of the way you are operating in those facilities that does not have to do with raw material prices or your end ph prices just cost improvements michael c gazmarian i think just on a sequential basis if you look back at our quarterly results for the year we started in q at a gross margin level at  and then were up to  and  relatively flat in q and q and then we dropped off  basis points this quarter i mean there is a lot of moving parts when you consider changes in our product mix and the addition of the asw plans but just in terms of our fourth quarter results if you were to pro forma and kind of normal office for some of those factors i think the gross margins would have been at or slightly exceeded the previous quarter levels i mean just in terms of the total potential improvement i mean that’s more difficult difficult to quantify i don’t know that are going to throw out a percentage or estimate on that ho woltz iii but tyson there is plenty of room for improvement which we are pursuing every day tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates okay once gallatin gets back up to running normally given the proximity given what you had done when you did the ivy acquisition is there room for asset rationalization within the company at that point in time depending on the market factors and if so what kind of utilization improvements would that give you ho woltz iii well i think you hit on the key factor that has to be considered as you look at rationalization opportunities and that is the market outlook and at this point we believe that there is a strong chance that the market supports efficient operations at all of these facilities and we wouldn’t undertake a serious rationalization effort unless we came to a different conclusion tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates okay and last question from me when you combine ivy with yourselves and  combining number  number  asw is another number  combining with number  give us an idea are you now over  of the market share do you have more strength given the regions than others and is your main threat still imports even though we do have the tariffs in place that should get renewed next year ho woltz iii okay when you are asking the question tyson are you referring strictly to pc strand or are you referring to welded wire reinforcement tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates to pc strand ho woltz iii yeah it is hard to know exactly where we stack up in the market as we have discussed before the market is bifurcated into the segment that has heavy buy america requirements and the segments which does not and in the segment which does not have those requirements we do continue to see imported pc strand as the major competitive threat to our business and certainly with developments in china and chinas willingness to spread low cost steel around the world that doesn’t help us in the imported segment of the market and competing with those imports but i would tell you that up to this point we have occupied a solid market position in the segment of the market that is affected by imports and that we expect to do the same going forward tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates in the buy america side pretty well is your market ho woltz iii well i mean there is plenty of competition out there tyson but i mean it is obvious that we have grown with the american spring wire acquisition and they did have a very attractive product mix represented by heavy buy america oriented participation tyson bauer  kansas city capital associates sounds great thank you gentlemen operator thank you operator instructions and i am showing no further questions at this time and i would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks ho woltz iii okay thank you we appreciate your interest in the company and we look forward to talking to you next
