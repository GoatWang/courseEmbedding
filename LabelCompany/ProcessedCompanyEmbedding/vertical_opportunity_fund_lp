capable browser to see this content play replay with sound play with sound   floating record™ vertical turntable chicago il product design  pledged of  goal  backers the floating record is a highperformance turntable that plays your records vertically through builtin dynamic fullrange stereo speakers or via rca line out we reimagined turntable technology that uses audiophilegrade materials and components the result is a visually and mechanically sound way to experience vinyl music floating record vertical turntable prototype floating record maple prototype at gramovox our design philosophy is to reimagine vintage audio design with modern technology in this spirit we sought to reimagine the record player we yearned for a visceral vinyl experience that showcased the record as both art and a medium to produce analog sound the result is a highperformance turntable that plays your records vertically—producing the illusion that it’s floating floating record walnut prototype we designed the floating record for everyone from the firsttime record listener to the seasoned vinyl enthusiast you’ll be spinning tunes out of the box in a matter of minutes you dont need to set up your cartridge or purchase additional outboard gear such as phono preamps amplifiers and speakers although you have the option to all of these are included in our integrated design floating record walnut prototype don’t hide your vinyl show it off the floating record allows you to showcase your vinyl while maintaining highquality playback floating record maple prototype traditional record players take up a lot of space and require additional components such as preamps amps integrated receivers speakers and all the necessary cables however the floating record’s integrated design allows it to beautifully fit into most environments with ease floating record walnut prototype floating record maple prototype we’ve engineered the floating record to flawlessly play your vinyl vertically and output fullrange stereo sound we deconstructed the elements of a premium turntable setup and reconstructed them in a manner that maintains their highperformance standards  floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version listen in  ⅓ or  rpm you can easily switch between  ⅓ or  rpm by moving the silicon belt over the inner or outer groove of the middle gear we include record clamps for both types of records floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version you can bypass the integrated speakers and use the floating record as a standalone hifi turntable for your own audio setup rca line out to external speakers you have the option of bypassing the internal amp and speakers and outputting an riaa equalized line level signal from the built in phonopreamp via the line out rca jacks the switch is used to choose between onboard and line out the onboard position activates the builtin phono stagethe  watt digital power amp and builtin speakers the “line out” bypasses the internal amplifier and speakers and takes the signal from our builtin phonopreamp to the “line out” rca jacks this allows the player to be used as a standalone hifi turntable rca out is a line level signal that is used to connect to an existing stereo system via the “tape in” or “aux in” inputs on your receiver preamp or amp floating record maple prototype floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version the floating record comes with a dynamic fullrange audio system we use two tymphany ” neodymium speakers driven by a w per channel digital amplifier the speaker cavities incorporate tuned bottom porting to offer superior bass response we achieved the best possible sound without compromising aesthetics or performance we created a fullyadjustable carbonfiber tonearm this audiophile staple is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis this allows it to be played in a vertical position and not flop to one side or the otherthe tracking force is dynamically applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is statically balanced spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied—especially on warped records our tonearms are factoryset at the optimal tracking force of  grams since our tonearm is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other typically the modulations in the groove can cause friction and this contributes to centripetal force acting on the arm and causing it to skate towards the center of the record our rigorous testing ensured no performance issues the audio technica ate is a warm sounding cartridge with a smooth high end sweet mids and rich low end the dual magnet cartridge comes with an elliptical diamond stylus an elliptical stylus has many advantages over spherical styli the elliptical stylus has two radii the front radius being wider than the side radius this allows the stylus to ride in the center of the groove like the conical stylus while the smaller side radius can more accurately track higher frequenciescompared to the conical stylus however the elliptical stylus has a longer vertical contact area and a narrower front to back contact area within the record groove the elliptical tip follows the groove modulations with more precision providing improved frequency response improved phase response and lower distortion specifically in the inner grooves of the record  weve developed a robust cueing mechanism that allows you to effortlessly cue your records this helps reduce the risk of scratching your records or damaging your stylus now you can cue up your favorite track with ease how does it work set your tonearm push cue lever watch your stylus gracefully fall onto the record beltdriven

newsletters vertical market share what is a vertical market a vertical market is a group of companies that serve each others specialized needs and that do not serve a broader market a vertical market is tightly focused on meeting the needs of one specific industry vertical markets are focused on a single niche such as creating payroll software for startup internet companies whereas a horizontal market is able to sell its goods and services in more than one industry and is therefore focused on a wider range of business segments breaking down vertical market vertical market providers are focused on specialized goods and services that meet the needs of a niche customer group that niche customer group can be either a specific industry or a specific demographic with this customer group the vertical market provider has the advantage of marketing its products to a specialized group which can make marketing campaigns more direct and effectivevertical market marketingwhile vertical markets are concentrated on a specific industry or demographic these concentrated markets can have a wide customer base while concentrated a wide vertical market customer base is advantageous for vertical marketing because the greater the demand for a specific product the greater the revenue opportunity in vertical market marketing marketers can prepare targeted marketing programs directed for their niche market this can make marketing efforts more effective than a broader horizontal marketing programin a vertical market customers have a high level of spending power this requires an important focus on the customer relationship by the vertical market provider while there may be a wide customer base for a specified vertical market each customer relationship is important because of the market’s narrow focus customers within a vertical market typically rely on a single service provider to meet their needs these customers have a deep and longterm need which makes the customer service relationship especially criticalexampleone example of a vertical market provider includes a company that manufactures automobile parts this type of company would belong to a vertical market since it would have a limited market of auto manufacturers and mechanics for its products a furniture manufacturer on the other hand would belong to a horizontal market because its customer base could include homeowners apartment dwellers offices hotels restaurants and morehorizontal market comparisoncompanies who provide horizontal market services must take a different marketing approach in a horizontal market a company must be able to market to a wider clientele this requires a broader marketing campaign that could include a much wider range of marketing tactics and channels in a horizontal market customer interaction can also vary considerably as companies market to a broader horizontal market they often have a wider range of customers for which they may interact with less frequently horizontal market interaction may require providers to focus on different aspects of product marketing and customer service including a greater focus on product distribution trading center

integrated speakers and use the floating record as a standalone hifi turntable for your own audio setup rca line out to external speakers you have the option of bypassing the internal amp and speakers and outputting an riaa equalized line level signal from the built in phonopreamp via the line out rca jacks the switch is used to choose between onboard and line out the onboard position activates the builtin phono stagethe  watt digital power amp and builtin speakers the “line out” bypasses the internal amplifier and speakers and takes the signal from our builtin phonopreamp to the “line out” rca jacks this allows the player to be used as a standalone hifi turntable rca out is a line level signal that is used to connect to an existing stereo system via the “tape in” or “aux in” inputs on your receiver preamp or amp floating record maple prototype floating record mdf w walnut veneer production version the floating record comes with a dynamic fullrange audio system we use two tymphany ” neodymium speakers driven by a w per channel digital amplifier the speaker cavities incorporate tuned bottom porting to offer superior bass response we achieved the best possible sound without compromising aesthetics or performance we created a fullyadjustable carbonfiber tonearm this audiophile staple is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis this allows it to be played in a vertical position and not flop to one side or the otherthe tracking force is dynamically applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is statically balanced spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied—especially on warped records our tonearms are factoryset at the optimal tracking force of  grams since our tonearm is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other typically the modulations in the groove can cause friction and this contributes to centripetal force acting on the arm and causing it to skate towards the center of the record our rigorous testing ensured no performance issues the audio technica ate is a warm sounding cartridge with a smooth high end sweet mids and rich low end the dual magnet cartridge comes with an elliptical diamond stylus an elliptical stylus has many advantages over spherical styli the elliptical stylus has two radii the front radius being wider than the side radius this allows the stylus to ride in the center of the groove like the conical stylus while the smaller side radius can more accurately track higher frequenciescompared to the conical stylus however the elliptical stylus has a longer vertical contact area and a narrower front to back contact area within the record groove the elliptical tip follows the groove modulations with more precision providing improved frequency response improved phase response and lower distortion specifically in the inner grooves of the record  weve developed a robust cueing mechanism that allows you to effortlessly cue your records this helps reduce the risk of scratching your records or damaging your stylus now you can cue up your favorite track with ease how does it work set your tonearm push cue lever watch your stylus gracefully fall onto the record beltdriven turntable on walnut prototype the floating record uses a belt drive system with a silicone belt to help isolate motor vibrations from the platter we choose a high quality ac synchronous motor and customdesigned a high precision motor control circuit to ensure silent operation and consistent speed this is mounted with rubber isolation bushings to help decouple it from the base our main platter spindle is made from stainless steel and runs in bronze bushing with a teflon bottom the plinth is cncmachined out of high mass acrylic to help reduce resonance the platter is also cncmachined acrylic to add mass and help reduce resonance all this works together to help our turntable achieve smooth consistent playback the floating record’s base will be composed of a miterfolded mdf box finished with a genuine maple or walnut veneer this method maintains our desired aesthetic prevents warping and minimizes the waste factor the finished product will look beautiful sound great and maintain a high level of performance
