investment process the team contact investment philosophy kiltearn partners llp employs a disciplined value philosophy this philosophy is distinguished by four key features global– our greatest opportunity lies in undervalued companies these opportunities surface in different countries and different industries at different times so we search globally for value longterm– stock market values often fluctuate to a much greater degree than underlying business values experience teaches us that such volatility frequently creates opportunities for the patient longterm investor fundamental– kiltearn focuses its resources on the bottomup fundamental analysis of individual companies we are interested in two factors  the price paid to own a piece of a business and the quality of that business benchmark agnostic – portfolios are built with a bottomup approach one stock at a time we believe the best way to outperform the benchmark is by having the courage to differ from it kiltearn
