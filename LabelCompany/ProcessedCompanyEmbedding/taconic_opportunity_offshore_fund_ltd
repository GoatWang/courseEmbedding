article share diggcom delicious stumbleuponcom redditcom facebook twitter linkedin close taconic capital launches sidecars for claims trades in iceland april     stephen taub the eventdriven and opportunityfocused hedge fund firm has raised  million for two new sidecars a source says new york–based taconic capital advisors a multistrategy hedge fund firm is betting on trade claims against the three largest failed banks in iceland and has created sidecars as investment platforms according to a source the sidecar funds have raised a total of  million in two separate closings the vehicles are no longer open to new investment a regulatory filing shows the funds are called taconic sidecar fund i a delaware limited partnership and taconic side offshore fund spc an offshore partnership the firm has been investing successfully in trade claims on icelandic banks through the main funds but this is the first time taconic capital founded in  has formed sidecar funds the firm which managed more than  billion as of the beginning of  runs eventdriven funds and opportunity funds according to an investor this is an investment position held in the existing funds sidecars were created for investors who wanted additional exposure investors in the new vehicles have committed a certain amount of capital but don’t have to write the checks until the firm is ready to invest investors may withdraw  percent of their capital on a monthly basis but investors may be charged a  percent fee on any withdrawals made prior to september   the filing said in one of the more dramatic consequences of the global financial crisis following the collapse of lehman brothers holdings iceland’s three major banks — glitnir banki landsbanki íslands and kaupthing bank — were placed in receivership in october  the banks had total debt obligations of about  billion according to new york–based law firm richards kibbe  orbe in a letter to clients in november  claims filed against the three banks that were tied to the bonds and other debt instruments issued by the banks before the crisis totaled more than  billion since the banks’ failure a secondary market for complex icelandic claims has emerged involving investment banks and hedge funds in the us and europe in spite of the substantial legal and economic difficulties involved in trading the claims across multiple jurisdictions the law firm said in the letter it isn’t clear why taconic has deemed icelandic bank claims an attractive investment worthy of sidecar vehicles taconic declined to comment for this article in its regulatory filing taconic said the sidecars expect to invest most of the assets in icelandic investments which may include fixedincome securities and other trade claims against impaired companies sidecars which are independently managed separate funds differ from side pockets which are usually attached to a bigger fund taconic’s sidecars have a oneyear investment period ending in march  according to a source the harvest period is set for two years although it could be extended the funds charge a  percent management fee and a  percent performance fee with an  percent preferred return the firm said it may launch additional sidecar funds in the future with different investment strategies and different fee structures taconic was founded by frank brosens and kenneth brody both goldman sachs  co alums brosens was a partner who once served as head of risk arbitrage while brody was a general partner and member of the management committee brody also previously served as president of the exportimport bank of the united states during the s the firm’s flagship taconic opportunity fund and its taconic opportunity offshore fund were up about  percent in  related articles  most read morning brief dan
