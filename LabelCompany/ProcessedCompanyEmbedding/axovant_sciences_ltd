section  of the code such united states person other than a “ excluded us member” as defined in our byelaws is referred to as a  us member then the voting rights of your shares that are treated as controlled shares of such  us member will be reduced in the aggregate with other controlled shares of such  us member to the extent necessary for controlled shares of such  us member to constitute less than  of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares under a formula specified in our byelaws the formula is applied repeatedly until there is no  us member   in addition the board may limit a shareholder’s voting rights when it deems it appropriate to do so to  avoid the existence of any  us member or  avoid adverse tax legal or regulatory consequences to us any of our subsidiaries or any direct or indirect shareholder or its affiliates as provided in our byelaws “controlled shares” of a united states person refer to all shares that such united states person is treated as owning directly indirectly or constructively within the meaning of section  of the code the amount of any reduction of votes that occurs by operation of the above limitations will generally be reallocated proportionately among our other shareholders whose shares are not controlled shares of a  us member so long as such reallocation does not cause any person to become a  us member the applicability of the voting power reduction provisions to any particular shareholder depends on facts and circumstances that may be known only to the shareholder or related persons accordingly we request that any holder of shares with reason to believe that it may be a  us member in the absence of the adjustments to voting rights provided in our byelaws contact us promptly so that we may determine whether the voting power of such holder’s shares has been or should be reduced   by submitting a proxy a holder of shares will be deemed to have confirmed that to its knowledge it is not and is not acting on

of the shareholder’s shares relationships with other shareholders or any other facts the board may consider relevant to the determination of the number of shares attributable to any person the board may disregard the votes attached to shares of any holder who fails to respond to such a request or who in its judgment submits incomplete or inaccurate information the board retains certain discretion

complete and deliver your proxy card your shares will not be voted   beneficial owner shares registered in the name of broker or bank   if you are a beneficial owner and do not instruct your broker bank or other agent how to vote your shares the question of whether your broker or nominee will still be able to vote your shares depends on whether the new york stock exchange or the nyse deems the particular proposal to be a “routine” matter brokers and nominees can use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares with respect to matters that are considered to be “routine” but not with respect to “nonroutine” matters under the rules and interpretations of the nyse “nonroutine” matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of shareholders such as mergers

incentive plan and in may  the board and the shareholders approved an amendment to our  equity incentive plan to increase the aggregate number of common shares authorized for issuance thereunder by  to an aggregate of  we refer to the amended  equity incentive plan as the plan pursuant to the terms of the plan an additional  common shares and  common shares were authorized for issuance under the plan effective april   and april   respectively   in this proposal  we are requesting that our shareholders approve axovant’s amended and restated  equity incentive plan or the amended plan to  increase the aggregate number of common shares authorized for issuance thereunder by  to an aggregate of  common shares  for purposes of section m of the internal revenue code as amended or the code as further described under “performancebased compensation” below increase the peremployee limit on a the number of shares subject to appreciationonly equity awards that may be granted to any employee under the plan during any specified period from  to  common shares b the number of shares subject to performancebased stock awards that may be granted to any employee under the plan during any

adjust the automatic annual share reserve increase from  of the total number of shares of capital stock outstanding on march  of the preceding calendar year to  of the total number of shares of capital stock outstanding on march  of the preceding fiscal year   our management board and compensation committee believe that equity awards are a key aspect of our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the face of intense competition for experienced drug developers and other personnel among many biopharmaceutical and health care companies the board upon the recommendation of the compensation committee has approved axovant’s amended plan if the shareholders do not approve proposal  as a consequence the plan will remain in effect but our ability to grant equity awards at competitive levels will be seriously diminished and we believe that it will negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain highly qualified personnel and our ability to manage future growth without the approval of proposal  management expects that the current common shares available for grant under the plan will not be sufficient to maintain our equity award practices for new employees or for promotions or merit awards for current employees   as of june   a total of  common shares were outstanding and there were  shares available for grant under the plan as of june   stock options

fully diluted shares outstanding at march   the end of fiscal year  was    performancebased compensation   the plan provides for performancebased awards that are intended to satisfy the requirements for “performancebased compensation” within the meaning of section m of the code the board believes that it is in the best interests of axovant and our stockholders to maintain a plan under which

publicly held corporation and its affiliates for certain compensation paid to any “covered employee” the chief executive officer and the next three most highly compensated officers other than the chief financial officer to the extent that the compensation paid to the covered employee for the taxable year exceeds  however certain kinds of compensation including qualified “performancebased compensation” are not subject to this deduction limitation in order for compensation awarded under a plan to qualify as “performancebased compensation” under section m among other requirements the

described above including the terms and conditions necessary for us to grant awards under the plan that may qualify as “performancebased compensation” under section m approval of the amended plan will also constitute approval of terms and conditions set forth in the amended plan that will permit us to grant awards under the amended plan that may qualify as “performancebased” compensation within the meaning of section m however in certain circumstances we may determine to grant compensation to covered employees that is not intended to qualify as “performancebased compensation” for purposes of

executive base salaries and bonuses and granting equity incentive awards we consider compensation for comparable positions in the market the historical compensation levels of our executives individual performance as compared to our expectations and objectives our desire to motivate our employees to achieve short and longterm results that are in the best interests of our stockholders and a longterm commitment to axovant we do not target a specific competitive position or a specific mix of compensation among base salary bonus or longterm incentives   the compensation committee of the board has historically determined compensation for our named executive officers the compensation committee typically reviews and discusses management’s proposed compensation with the principal executive officer for all named executive officers other than the principal executive officer based on those discussions and its discretion the compensation committee then recommends the compensation for each named executive officer the compensation committee without members of management present discusses and ultimately approves the compensation of our named executive officers for our fiscal years ended march   and  the compensation committee retained radford a compensation consulting firm to evaluate and make recommendations with respect to our executive compensation program        annual cash bonus   we seek to motivate and reward our executives for achievements relative to our corporate goals and expectations for each fiscal year the target cash bonus is  of each named executive officer’s base

was employed by our wholly owned subsidiary axovant sciences inc the employment agreement or offer letter for each of our named executive officers sets forth the initial terms and conditions of his employment these agreements provide for atwill employment and set forth the officer’s annual base salary performance bonus target opportunity initial equity incentive grant terms of severance and eligibility for employee benefits each of them provided services to us pursuant to the intercompany         services agreement described below under “transactions with related persons—certain relatedperson transactions—services agreements with roivant sciences inc and roivant sciences gmbh” in april  in connection with the appointment of dr hung as our principal executive officer and chief executive officer of axovant sciences inc mr ramaswamy resigned as our principal executive officer and chief executive officer of axovant sciences inc for the purposes of this discussion references to “we” “us” and “our” will be deemed to refer to axovant sciences inc as context requires   under each named executive officer’s employment agreement or offer letter such executive officer is eligible for the following severance and change in control benefits conditioned upon delivering a release of claims in our favor   ·if we terminate the officer’s employment without cause or the officer resigns for good reason then we will pay to the officer a onetime cash payment equal to the sum of his annual base salary and annual bonus target opportunity we will also reimburse the officer for continued medical coverage for one year if he timely elects such continued coverage   ·if the officer is employed by us immediately prior to a change in control then all remaining common shares underlying the officer’s outstanding options will vest and in the case of mr ramaswamy and dr weinhoff we will pay to the executive officer a prorated portion of his annual target bonus based on the higher of target or actual achievement of prorated performance targets as of the change in control   ·if the officer is employed by us immediately prior to a change in control and within one year after the change in control the officer’s employment is terminated without cause or the officer resigns for good reason then he will receive a onetime cash payment equal to  times the sum of i his current annual base salary and ii his annual bonus target opportunity we will also reimburse the officer for continued medical coverage for  months if he timely elects such continued coverage   the definitions of “cause” “good reason” and “change in control” are set forth in the individual employment agreements   we consider the severance and change in control benefits described above to be critical to attracting and retaining high caliber executives we believe that appropriately structured severance and change in control benefits including accelerated vesting provisions minimize the distractions and reduce the risk that an executive voluntarily terminates his employment with us during times of uncertainty such as before an acquisition is completed we believe that our existing arrangements allow each named executive officer to focus on continuing normal business operations and in the event of a change in control on the success of a potential business combination rather than on how business decisions that may be in the best interest of our shareholders will impact his own financial security   david t hung md   on april   the board appointed dr hung as our principal executive officer dr hung is the
