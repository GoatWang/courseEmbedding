interview mark augusti ceo  bioventus the new smith and nephew biologics spinout  your  orthopedic industry site ▪ stay informed ▪ contact tiger for better recruiting my story i believe tigerrecruiting about contact interview mark augusti ceo  bioventus the new smith and nephew biologics spinout smith  nephew biologics new joint venture with essex woodlands – an interview with mark augusti orthospinenews we recently heard the news about smith  nephew selling  of their biologics division to essex woodlands in a joint venture we caught up with the new president and ceo of the new company and got his thoughts on the news interview with mark augusti ceo bioventus llc drue de angelis mark thanks for taking some time with us today could you give us your brief background and how did you end up where you are today  mark augusti  i joined ge medical systems right out of earning a degree from duke university i was in the imaging business for a number of years and i had a foray into investment banking from  to  i joined smith  nephew in april of  as the global vp of marketing for the trauma business and i’ve been with them since friday of last week may  when i transferred over as ceo of bioventus at midnight on may th at smith  nephews i had various orthopedic roles going from vp to general manager to president i’ve been involved with our clinical therapies business which was exogen and supartz inandout of the trauma business and in  moved to president of smith  nephews biologics division  drue de angelis why did smith  nephew want to “spinoff” the biologics division mark augusti if you look at the new stated strategic aspirations of the ceo of smith  nephew he really wants to focus on the growing markets the emerging markets because they’re international and he wants to reallocate the resources from the established markets to the growing markets  he also wants to focus on their core surgical implant business –  both the orthopedics as well as wound management so when you look at the biologics business it was a bit of a tough strategic challenge smith  nephew felt that biologics was important and regenerative medicine was important for the future direction they wanted to play in but they felt they couldn’t invest it appropriately there were three investment challenges one was the scale of investment — the amount of investment required to have meaningful play in that space second is  the length of time to market most orthopedic companies look to a three year product cycle really when you look at biotech or biologics you’re talking about getting minimum three to five maybe seven year product development cycle the third thing is the riskiness of that profile as a public company and seen more as a medical device company it’s harder to justify to the investors of smith  nephew public company the profile of that so when we started talking about it even before olivier came on we had these challenges and then when olivier came on and really looked at it he realized that given those three things there’s a real winwin here for the shareholders an opportunity to monetize some of the current value in the business for smith  nephew shareholders and that will probably only be  of the smith  nephew revenue for smith  nephew to retain the minority position the significant minority position which should give them the window into biologics and this is all assuming we find the right investor to partner with us provide capital to dedicate to the space that would allow smith  nephew to have that window and potentially assuming we do our jobs well create value for their equity stake so that’s the reason for the spinoff we’re very excited about it obviously as bioventus a private company focused on ortho biologics with orthopedic active healing we think we will be able to do different licensing and acquisition deals that normally wouldn’t rise to the “doablility” of smith  nephew just because given the other demands they have from their strategic priorities that i’ve outlined previously as far as what we are going to do different the main thing is we’re still going to run our business competing to win we’re going to focus on our spaces and we’re now going to focus on longer term investment deals as i said that   to seven year profile and we’re looking to do very interesting deals off this platform that we have of bioventus drue de angelis  what will happen to the existing smith  nephew employees as a result of the spinoff mark augusti  as of the transaction closing on friday all of the us employees including myself and my executive staff have transferred over we’re no longer smith  nephew employees we’re now employees of bioventus  as for our international business — just due to the regulatory issues both from a legal and a labor law standpoint – we couldn’t really get it done right away so you have a process you have to go through you have  to adhere to that process our plan is to do that over time so that we have roughly  to  international employees and plan is to have them all come over the next  to  months the way it’s working is as of the close of the transaction smith  nephew is now our distributor internationally and those employees are still smith  nephew employees doing the same thing they did last week selling our products now given the distributor relationship we will just work with smith  nephew we have a very good working relationship with them and we’ll transfer the international business in an orderly fashion drue de angelis so the focus is then in the nonsurgical arena bone healing and different injectables are you thinking of expanding beyond that to other nonsurgical modalities as well mark augusti well certainly when things come our way we look at them and we’re free to do as we want but i think right now there’s interesting opportunities in bone healing technologies as well as cartilage regenerative technologies we’re looking at some things in soft tissue as well but we think between bone and healing and cartilage technologies there’s a lot of opportunity we have a  or so person direct sales force in the us calling on orthopedic and podiatry outpatient clinics and we think that’s a huge value for bioventus we think we have the best performing and largest scale sales force so we’re looking to leverage that platform to other interesting things so from that standpoint we also given the equity and new capital of bioventus we’re going to build out this model internationally it was a little hard to do that under smith  nephew given the substance of the operations given it was a more surgical distribution platform ous we started that process and will continue that process under bioventus and build our own direct selling force internationally  that will focus on orthopedic outpatient and orthopedic active healing technologies drue de angelis very good that sounds like you got your hands full lots to do mark augusti well we do we got a good partner in smith  nephew and given they have retained a significant position they have every incentive to make sure we get our sea legs under us and get running you can imagine i had direct responsibility for a pretty large sales and marketing development and even clinical affairs and regulatory affairs capabilities but the challenge is back office finance back office hr and all the ip systems we got to build those within bioventus so that’s what we will be doing over the next year drue de angelis do you think we’ll see more joint ventures like this in orthopedics mark augusti i think it represents a very interesting model there’s been partnerships done in the pharma and biotech world before and medtech spinoffs but i don’t think there’s been anything as interesting as this where a major device multinational has maintained such a large position in the spinout and i think if you take the essex woodlands and their profile as a growth equity player as someone who really can invest in technology and do this it’s a unique model that people are going to watch to see if we can really be successful doing this at the extend we can we’d be paving the way in a changing environment with a lot of regulatory changes challenges on data and health economics data and really creating value i think we’re going to prove as we become successful that this may be a different way to go i think the days of just getting a product out there a device a k and try to get a certain amount of runrate revenue and hope a strategic comes along i’m not going to say that’s still not going to happen now and then but there’s so much stuff chasing the deals there’s so much capital out there this is a different model this is a model that is compelling that will take some strategic thinking but there’s few firms that can pull it off  i think other multinationals are going to look at this because frankly even if you’re larger than smith  nephew you’re going to have similar type challenges when you look at precious resources and where your investment dollars go i think to that extent people will be interested over time drue de angelis  do you have any announcements relative to new product offerings mark augusti i’m not expecting to have any major announcements over the short term i think we have enough just doing this and people are going to be watching this is a challenge for all medtech and if you look at the covidiens the jj’s the strykers of the world even ge there’s a lot of big medtech companies who are looking to the emerging markets for their growth the big challenge for them is how do they stay relevant and manage their share in the established markets given all of the changes and the pricing pressures and still fund that growth which is challenging while still maintaining an appropriate rd and new product development pipeline we’re smaller but we aren’t very small we’re an over  million company and i think we’re on the right platform to compete in this space and orthopedics is calling out for that there’s so much biological research and research going on there are few entities that are going to be positioned to really look at what is out there and take a little bit of a longer view and do the work to invest in this space and created really good value propositions the way we’re approaching it is that you’ve got to have a health economic value proposition you’ve got to have something that has clinical data that you can then talk to the payors and governments about and get reimbursement for your product if you look at our two core products that we have both bone stimulation and joint fluid therapy both have great health economic stories and they’re saving dollars in the healthcare system one of the key things we look at is what’s the value proposition and is it sustainable and what are the economics behind it and that’s the way the government is going whether or not obamacare gets repealed and those types of things it is already being established having good clinical data really make a difference in allows you to tell your story protect your franchises and frankly justify being a value for your products and that’s the direction we plan to move in drue de angelis with the challenge of raising money these days do you think joint venture is something that smaller companies can take advantage of mark augusti that’s a great question and we will see i think it is tough if you don’t have the scale the revenue that remains to be seen and that is why this is so unique in that we’ve got a really good cash flow which gives us the platform and the options to move forward i think it is going to be tougher on the startups and people want to see startups with a more detailed plan funded through getting beyond prerevenue it’s clear to me at least is today’s environment that strategics are not really interested in taking on the regulatory risk the reimbursement risk and all the other things they might have taken on in the past if they thought that the idea that a new “mousetrap” would look good there’s so much risk out there in the medtech world you may not even get reimbursement i think things are having to be funded longer as such are requiring more capital and it’s making it tougher for the venture community that’s why essex woodlands has been really farsighted in trying to partner and do a deal like this they have set themselves apart on this deal and being able to do something like that i also think smith  nephew did the same thing and the board of directors should get credit for that clearly i had the germ of the idea for that and advocated for it but it’s not any one person there’s a few people who see the value in it and have to get comfortable with that i do think when this deal was announced back in january other multinationals took notice and said we’ve got “smaller” businesses in our portfolio that are a bit trapped that we know we’re not able to fund appropriately as we would like so let’s try and understand this deal how do you do a deal like this and have it make sense i think we’ve got a great team and we’re all about transitioning the team appropriately and we’ve got great partners great employees i know my employees are excited about this there is more to come as we go forward one response to interview mark

due to the decline in sales in the base business product line first quarter rest of the world product revenue represented  of total product revenue compared to  of total product revenue in the same quarter of  turning to a review of our results across the rest of the pl first quarter gross margin was  of total revenue compared to  of total revenue last year the decrease in gross margin yearoveryear was driven by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the timing of royalty payments received first quarter operating expenses increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear the increase in expenses driven primarily by higher general and administrative expense compared to the first quarter of  including a  million increase in patent litigation expense and a  increase in personnel costs net loss was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share for the same period last year we realized better than expected q revenue performance of roughly  million driven by the combination of the following two factors first we saw roughly  million of surgeries recognized in january having been delayed from the second half of december most likely due to the year end holidays second we experienced a significantly higher conversion rate of orders into surgeries in the first quarter this resulted in roughly  million of surgeries occurring in the first quarter that we would have expected to occur in the second quarter based on historical conversion trends based on these results we are maintaining the financial guidance that we provided on february   for the full year  the company continues to expect the total revenue in a range of  million to  million with product revenue in a range of  million to  million and royalty revenue of approximately  and total gross margin in a range of  to  with that i will turn the call back to mark mark augusti okay thanks paul as i mentioned on our last call we are focused on four strategic priorities at conformis commercial execution gross margin improvement innovation and talent management first on commercial execution we’ve identified number of new areas where we plan to make field investments either through direct representation or an agent relationship we’re making changes in our us and the us sales management teams in addition we’ve added new management resources to our contracting and market access teams we continue to believe that outpatient knee surgery is an important opportunity is an area of focus for us during this period of transition and of course as mentioned previously consumer awareness is also an area focus for us we’ve added two resources to focus on microsite marketing and the patient experience our patient ambassador program is helping to drive patients to conformis while our track my implant program is allowing us to communicate directly to patients prior to the surgery which helps patients make informed decisions with respect to their care all of this is key to our current commercial strategy regarding gross margin in the first quarter i appointed dedicated leadership and project teams to focus on our gross margin improvement initiatives we continue to make progress with our vertical integration strategy as communicated previously at the end of  we insource all of our itotal cr and itotal ps metal tibia trays as planned in q we begin manufacturing of our polyethylene inserts of itotal cr and pleased to report that we are producing internally more than half of those polyinserts our plans to start making itotal poly – excuse me itotal ps poly later this year remain on track we continue to make significant progress with the development of new processes for d printing of our patient’s specific ijigs resulting in print cycle time reduction and powder utilization we believe this will reduce our capital outlays for d nylon printers in  and onward our multiyear plan to offshore some of our cad design work as well as our continued improvements in designed software and cad automation should provide additional gross margin expansion over time in short we are seeing steady progress in our operating programs which we believe will yield progressive improvements in gross margin in  and  with continued incremental improvement in future years as for innovation we’ve kicked off development programs for our next generation iuni and itotal systems we continue to prepare – excuse me to pursue our itotal hip clearance and of course we are constantly evaluating new technology and new partnership opportunities we have a great team here at conformis we consider ourselves change agents in the field of orthopedics and are committed to producing the best total knee system available we’re passing on our belief that everyone should have access to our technology and every knee patients should have the ability to make a choice that leads to better outcomes and satisfaction thank you for your participation today we’ll now turn it over for questions and back to the operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mike weinstein with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead mike weinstein good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the questions mark as the starting point you made some comments just about the sales management in the us – in your us sales teams some changes there can you give us more specifics in terms of what you may have already done or what you’re planning to do mark augusti yes i can and obviously a lot of these are personnelrelated but we have two area vps that will be retiring towards the middle of the year we’ve already back filled one of those roles and we’re in the process of a search for the second role as well as we have made some changes in a couple of our recent regional sales manager roles mike weinstein okay and is that the extent of it or are there bigger changes and has there been turnover in your reps at this point over the last six month mark augusti well there will be more changes mike as i said it’s the year of transitions and out of respect some of those things – we’ll talk about those as they come about we have made the additions i’m pleased to say where we’ve brought in a new vp for our national accounts which is gentleman who has over  years of experience we are so very excited about that as well as i think as i communicated last time we’ve identified an individual i don’t believe he started as of our last call maybe he have but we have a vp of market access which i think is really going to be helpful as we move going forward so we’ll continue – i continue to look at things in that area but we are going to continue to make changes in the field as i see necessary mike weinstein and you – in the comments you made today and then on the q call you kind of talked about redoing effectively the commercial playbook for the company where are you and kind of your thought process on what that needs to look like going forward and is there a point in which you think lay that out in greater detail to the industry mark augusti well i don’t know if we’ll lay it out in greater detail but we’ve developed it – detailed we’re rolling out on training we’re actually in the search process for higherlevel sales training individual but again these areas that we talked about sales execution the playbook will talk about targeting and identification and selling and kind of how we go through the business process here at conformis so it’s a big thing about sales execution and the other things we’ll do around to support that will be the things that we’ve talked about before we’re on an outpatient knee surgery directtoconsumer kol engagement i mean the course will continue our investment around trails that support health economic and patient outcomes mike weinstein okay and have you made any decisions on product map on your pipeline in which you want to be investing in mark augusti well probably it’s the newest information that you may have picked up in the prepared remarks is we have kicked off next generation of our iuni products and our itotal products so we’ve made some decisions around that we’re excited about the opportunities there as you know we can’t sit still there’s always continuous improvement in learning and with our model at conformis we’re able to roll out some of those changes i think more easily and certainly with less capital outlay and then we continue to pursue the hip with the fda and we’re – our policy is obviously not to comment on that but as soon as there is news on that we’ll certainly disclose that as appropriate and then when we do we’ll talk more about what the plan is from there mike weinstein okay last item can you just spend a minute on the changes you’re making to itotal and iuni mark augusti yes so first off i think there’s been a couple of followups that’s money in the bank mike but as it relates to iuni and itotal look we get surgeon feedback and there’s some changes for making the procedure easier so just to give you one example when we first launched iuni our ijig’s weren’t referenced off the osteophytes yes that discrete the osteophytes off and then you had a physician at the ijig and there was a little bit of flexing and some uncertainty and it was a little bit of challenging learning skill for some of our surgeons and in spite of that we still got great outcomes but when we launched the itotal we referenced – our ijigs referenced off the osteophytes and we realized that’s actually a much better way and the surgeons actually really like that so one an example with our iuni program is one of the goals of that program will be to change the referencing so that we reference off the osteophytes and the disease that’s present at the knee at a time so we’ll make that procedure better another small example on the itotal is announcing the ips – the itotal ps we’ve made some improvements on tibial tray we see an opportunity to actually merge the tibial tray both cr and ps projects so part of the goal of that program will be to do that that will actually give us – we think can improve clinical performance easeofuse in the surgery as well as mike it will be part of gross margin improvement for us mike weinstein that’s helpful thanks mark mark augusti thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead larry biegelsen hey guys good afternoon thanks for taking the question paul couple of questions on the quarter just trying to understand the underlying growth in the us given all the moving parts i think plus  yearoveryear but you benefited a year ago i think catch up from the recall but it sounds like there was a onetime benefit this quarter can you help parse out what you see is underlying growth in the us and i do have a followup thanks paul weiner yes so as we have talked about in the last call as far as  the first quarter of  there were – it left us with a difficult case because of the late surgeries related to the recall and that amounted somewhere estimated around  million to  million of additional revenue that we recognized in the first quarter of  that’s not necessarily reoccurring revenue it was delayed from  so you need to take that out and that obviously got it to the underlying growth but here we’re talking about is  to  but certainly this is – the first quarter by certainly much greater than the  and then when we’re looking at the performance in the first quarter there are a couple of items that i mentioned that helped off the first quarter and the first one – and we’re still talking about  million in excess of our expectations for the first quarter and about half of it was related to surgeries in the second half of december that really happened in january because of the holidays around the end of december so that helps us out by about  million in the first quarter the second fee is related to the conversion rate and the conversion rate ended up being much higher in the first quarter than historical averages and that helped us out by about  million we would expect that that higher conversion rate not continue going forward which means that we could have a fall in from the second quarter into the first quarter on that we had a same effect actually in the second quarter of last year where our conversion rate was higher in the second quarter and we ended up with a pull in from the third quarter so we’re in the same situation here with the first quarter having a higher conversion rate potentially pulling in from the second quarter larry biegelsen that’s helpful just doing a math paul is it – as you saying that if you do the math the underlying growth in the us looks like it was  maybe even greater just making those adjustments would you agree with that and just lastly for me maybe could you help us understand what’s going on outside the us i know you talked about changes in germany in the last call your ous performance was much better than we expected this quarter how should we think about the remaining quarters this year thanks for taking the questions guys paul weiner yes the underlying growth you’re talking about in the first quarter in the us i would agree with that an excess of when you do the adjustments the rest of world i think we did a little bit better than we expected on the partial business related to the reimbursement but we don’t expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year and overall we did have a little bit weaker performance in our german business in the first quarter keep in mind that ous just like the us had the difficult ops because of the delayed surgeries as well as in the first quarter which did affect our growth percentage ous larry biegelsen thanks for taking the question guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kyle rose with canaccord your line is open please go ahead kyle rose hi great thank you for taking the questions can you hear me all right mark augusti yes kyle kyle rose great i’m in the airport so i apologize about any background noise but i just wanted to ask one quick question on the new product discussion and then just a followup on the outpatients on the new product discussion i realize your previous management have talked about just the fact that you got the adjust in time delivery of inventory and the ability to innovate much of your products without large capital installed base from instrumentation standpoint can allow for quicker market entry or quicker innovation on a product plan just wanted to see what your thoughts are on the timing of new products and when you think these may be able to contribute and then you also mentioned outpatient is being a focus moving forward just wondering if you could give us an idea where outpatient is as a percentage of us revenues now and then how do you think about that as a growth contributor moving forward mark augusti sure this is mark kyle relative to iuni and itotal projects at this point from a timing standpoint we would expect that we would be on a limited market release being able to get kind of first practicing market in the second half of  we’re still flushing out a couple of things around the itotal project which is a little bit of a bigger project but certainly by q of  i would think on both the new iuni and the new itotal we could be in the market with our clinical versions so i think that’s pretty fast comparing to traditional systems as it relates to outpatient surgery we – i don’t think we’re prepared to give that breakout at this point it’s a very new space we’re looking at that whether there’s – i don’t know if there’s a general acceptable classification around that yet so i don’t know that i would want to hazard a number i don’t know paul if you have any thoughts on kind of outpatients surgery break out paul weiner yes i know that’s difficult at this point in time we’re still in the process of hiring somebody just be dedicated to growing that side of the business mark augusti yes and to be clear the way to envision that role is it’s kind of a sales marketing contracting role where all role is one that space is moving pretty quickly we think we’ve got a great opportunity with our product concept and the logistics and the way we do things here at conformis but there’s still a lot to be involved as far as how you work with the providers and the payers around outpatient needs so we want to be – our goal is to be at the forefront of that so that’s why we’re looking to bring someone on that will focus in that area kyle rose okay great and then just one followup i think in the last call you talked about in  you would be in a bit of a transition year as you really took charge and made some strategic and infrastructure changes to the organization just wanted to see your thought process on that now and just how you view the cadence for some of those changes layering into the business as far as your driving top line growth over the course of the next  months to  months thank you mark augusti yes well it’s like anything else some things are better than expected some things are not but in general we’re on plan and i think as you can tell from messaging here and there’s going to be change and change is always a challenge to manage so i would say that it’s kind of as anticipated at this point thank you kyle operator next question operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve lichtman with oppenheimer  company your line is open please go ahead steve lichtman thanks mark you talked a lot about the initiatives underway with the commercial organization i was wondering if the part of that you expect net sales rep addition this year and if so about how much growth would you expect in the sales force mark augusti so as you know we don’t give out our rep numbers but i can absolutely say we do expect the net addition now obviously you always have unanticipated attrition and whatnot that we have to deal with and we’ll backfill those but in general yes the plan is definitely to have net salesagent additions paul weiner and just to give a little bit more detail on that we are targeting the third quarter to bring on a number of additional reps steve lichtman okay and then just second question just a followup on outpatient side you mentioned hiring someone obviously to lead that effort but where do you envision that going over the next couple of years do you envision a separate sales force calling on the ambulatory surgery centers how do you see this program working for you generally over the next couple of years mark augusti so yes – no i don’t envision different sales force at all as i said because of our unique selling model i think we’re well positioned there but part of what we have to do i think is help be the change agent that can help providers physicians feel comfortable about outpatient surgery program and we have to be knowledgeable on all the things that it takes to make that program successful because we’re all committed – look we’re all committed to better patient outcomes and a safe environment for total knee patients that given in outpatient setting so that’s why i say this this role is i see is a coordination role and frankly helping to refine the marketing message and then to train our existing sales force about what it means to do outpatient knee surgery because you know it’s not exactly the same as inpatient and as i go around and talk to physicians there’s a lot of interest around this but again there’s a lot of questions so that’s kind of the way i envision it but absolutely it would be the same sales force but it will be a tailored kind of targeted message when they’re looking at outpatient opportunities steve lichtman got it thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bruce nudell with suntrust robinson humphrey your line is open please go ahead bruce nudell good afternoon thanks for taking the question depending upon how you slice the revenue a portion of that in the us market it looks like you have  to  partial knee share on a revenue basis and  to  cr share this quarter there was a decline in that base business and it seems sluggish have you guys asymptoted in that sector or is it just the sales force is focused on the ps which is bigger arrogant revenue opportunity mark augusti well there’s no doubt that the ps is a bigger aggregate revenue opportunity bruce but it’s a fair question look i don’t think we’ve reached some point where we are falling back at least that’s not the expectation i have i think we’ve got a great product in the cr and a great product in the ps and i think again we talked about this in the past there’s going to be some of our surgeons that move over to ps and i think we’ve kind of seen that play out now in the fifth quarter so as the ps launch but we are – but i still think that we have an opportunity in the cr and i’d like to think that as we keep up our commercial performance – or excuse me improve our commercial performance we’ll see that not just in ps but also in the base business bruce nudell and just to clarify when i talked to investors they routinely push back and say well the surgeon i talked to said he’s reluctant to use conformis because if it doesn’t work in that particular instance there’s a big problem and he doesn’t have “bailout” could you just speak to the frequency of which that happens and perhaps also speak to how are you training your surgeons to deal with that probably unlikely circumstance mark augusti all right well again this is a question even in my diligence i ask myself and it’s certainly a question that’s going to come up we need think about what i can say is when i do my own channel checks with my conformis users i’m not going to say it’s never happened but we’ve done  procedures or more todate and i’d probably can count on less than – well i can certainly personally count less than one hand the number of times that a surgeon admits to me that there’s been some need to change the surgery during the procedure so what i would say and what i do say personally to surgeons that are considering trying conformis is there’s a lot of work in the industry around if you feel you need a backup plan there for your first few cases by all means do that but when you talk to any of our longtime users and our highvolume users it’s just not something that you have to be concerned about and even in – let’s say even in traditional knee surgery things happen that require them to switch systems or to change out that have happened i would say our occurrence of that is at least again i don’t want to say something out on specific study too but i would say it’s probably not any greater rate than i’m aware of so i think it’s a fair thing that we have to get over and that’s part of what our sales force deals with everyday but we’ve got a great product that’s delivering improved outcomes and i think that concern it is worth overcoming to deliver better patient results bruce nudell thanks so much mark augusti thank you bruce any other questions operator thank you we have a followup question from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead larry biegelsen hey guys thanks for taking the followup mark i heard you – i think the prepared remarks talk about potential collaboration i think that’s the first time i have ever heard conformis talk about that did i hear correctly and could you elaborate on what you might be thinking about thanks for taking the question mark augusti yes you did read me right and that probably is maybe a different statement there’s nothing – certainly nothing that i’m prepared to talk about or nothing that i would say is there but the point is we are an orthopedic company we happen to have a different process and different model but we’re looking to grow the company so we look at technology opportunities we look at those opportunities either through acquisition development opportunities or we look for partner – partnership opportunities and this can both be insourcing or potentially outsourcing so nothing larry i’m afraid to talk about today other than to just to state publicly that we’re considering – things around certainly considering those things and we are looking at them larry biegelsen fair enough thanks for taking the question mark mark augusti yes operator we have a followup question from the line of bruce nudell with suntrust robinson humphrey you line is open go ahead bruce nudell hi mark just one followup question stryker really highlighted the mako robot and both your system and their system have a heavy dose of preplanning that takes almost a lot of the ambiguity out of every case you guys go about reducing variability in different ways of course but their argument with regards to the ultimate superiority of the robot pertains to the fact that they can adjust within the case to any soft tissue anomalies that won’t show up on a ct scan and could you just speak to the evidence that you have todate that in fact your implant which is kind of perfect to begin with really doesn’t face much problem in the field in dealing with soft tissue anomalies mark augusti yes absolutely so a couple of things first off look i will – i understand that a robot can take the variability out of making a surgical bone cut and i think that’s the real value of that but at the end of the day stryker is still focused on trying to make a challenging surgery better the reason why the surgery is challenging is because the surgeon is using a tool that’s  years old they’re using an illfitting lshaped implant at conformis we are taking modern technology and we’re creating a better implant that is matched to the patient’s anatomy and as a result as we’ve seen in papers that have reported this or certainly posters reported this we have less of these soft tissue releases when you have to recut or redo something it’s because you’ve got a problem with alignment o rotation you’ve got a problem with fit they’re going to have to do that more often and so yes the robot is going to help them do that our system the incidence of having to do that as reported in these posters is much less now having said that we still have to have a good surgeon and a well trained surgeon put our implant in and if it cuts off a millimeter or two we have ability in our ijig for them to be able to make that adjustment when they go but the number of times they have to do either a ligament release or some type of an adjustment on cut especially an adjustment on cut is very very rare and we feel like at the end of the day they get a better outcome and we think that our solution what we’re providing will be a much bigger improvement over historical or traditional offtheknee – offtheshelf knee surgery than the robot will provide i will allow that hopefully they’ll demonstrate it through their own clinical trials and their own research and not just kind of anecdotal information but i will allow that robot should allow for more reproducible cuts that is the whole question about the health economic value of that but i’ll leave that for the robot companies to decide at this point but it’s a great question bruce and we think we’ve got a better mousetrap as it relates to that bruce nudell thanks so much operator thank you and this does conclude today’s qa session this also does conclude today’s program ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s

me on the call today is our cfo paul weiner in terms of a brief agenda paul and i will share our prepared remarks on a variety of topics including of course our fourth quarter financial and operating performance our financial outlook and guidance for  which we introduced in this afternoons press release and the companys nearterm strategic priorities and key milestones additionally i thought it might would be helpful if i shared my thoughts on what attracted me to this position where i have been spending my time and efforts since joining the company and what i have learned in the first  weeks as ceo following the prepared remarks paul and i look forward to answering your questions we have a lot to cover this afternoon so lets dive in before turning to our fourth quarter and yearend results i would like to briefly review my initial experiences since joining as ceo on november  and share my high level thoughts on our strategic roadmap going forward in my first few months i have been meeting with people throughout the organization and acquaint myself with the business i have also spent a fair amount of time with customers and other stakeholders such as investors suppliers etcetera many of these discussions have highlighted areas of excellence and differentiating for the company as well as certain areas where we have opportunities for improvement i was attracted to this position for multiple reasons and these discussions have confirmed many of them first conformis has incredibly differentiated technology and capabilities that are making a difference to patient outcome second our highly differentiated technology is supported by two important factors strong ip portfolio and a large and growing body of clinical evidence which together give me confidence in our longterm growth opportunity our growing body of evidence demonstrates that conformis implants can deliver significant economic savings over traditional implants third we have a solid customer clinician loyalty i have connected with many of our customers i am awed by the amazing stories they have related to me those i have spoken with are convinced that conformis is enabling them to deliver better outcomes than they were getting with off the shelf technology and finally our patients our technology and business model is still easily marketable in todays digital enabled society the ability for conformis to speak directly to patients about the benefits of our ifit technology is so well aligned with todays active and informed community of healthcare consumers there is no better example of this then the two new programs we are in the process of rolling out our patient ambassador program which has the ability to connect prospective patients to conformis with existing conformis patients and then our track the implant program where patients can track their implants being designed manufactured and shipped to the or in terms of some potential opportunities for the company first we want to strengthen and continuously improve our commercial execution while we have done some things well was clear to me during my initial reviews but there are a few gaps and areas for improvement we will continue to invest in our selling infrastructure and we are establishing clear strategic priorities our management team will be tasked with insuring that we execute our priorities and that resources are allocated to those highest priorities in our strategic plan second improvement of the companys gross margin will be a point of emphasis my early assessments suggest that we have identified the significant opportunities for margin improvement that are in the process of being resourced and implemented now we just need to execute on those over time we believe that we can steadily achieve significant higher gross margins i will discuss thoughts on how we possibly execute with each of these as part of my commentary on strategic priorities later in the call before turning the call over to paul i want to share a few considerations regarding our revenue guidance for  which we introduced in the press release this afternoon there are a few considerations highly to investors as you evaluate those expectations for the year first  will be a transition year for the commercial team i anticipate many changes as we develop communicate and execute a more targeted commercial strategy while we don’t anticipate large changes to the existing selling team i do anticipate additional adds both in employee and rest in agents and that we will manage these resources differently then we have in the past in order to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and accelerate surgeon adoption this will be an investment year with plans to accelerate spending on commercialization activities however the impact from these activities will not be immediate the second item impacting our  growth is an unexpected change in the reimbursement of our iuni and iduo partial implants in germany in december it was announced that the reimbursement for customized partial knee procedures will be reimbursed at the same rate as the off the shelf partial knee procedures beginning january  through  hospitals were receiving a premium reimbursement on our partial implant we expect that this will adversely affect sales of our partial knee replacements in germany with that let me turn the call over to paul for a detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal  results and our  guidance paul paul weiner thank you mark total revenue for the fourth quarter of  increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to the fourth quarter  total revenue in the fourth quarter of  and  includes royalty revenue of approximately  related to patent license agreements fourth quarter product revenue increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported and constant currency basis us product revenue increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear rest of world product revenue decreased  to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported basis and decreased  on a constant currency basis this yearoveryear decrease in rest of the world revenue was primarily due to fourth quarter  being positively affected by rescheduled cases from the third quarter  into the fourth quarter of  due to our recall in september of  as detailed in our press release this afternoon fourth quarter product revenue from sales of itotal cr iduo and iuni decreased  to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported basis and decreased  on a constant currency basis this yearoveryear decrease in base business revenue was primarily due to fourth quarter  being positively affected by rescheduled cases from the recall fourth quarter product revenue from sales of our itotal ps increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported and constant currency basis fourth quarter us product revenue represented  of total product revenue compared to  of total product revenue in the same quarter of  fourth quarter rest of the world product revenue represented  of total product revenue compared to  of total product revenue in the same quarter of  total fourth quarter revenue was impacted by approximately  due to changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year turning to a review of our results across the rest of the pl fourth quarter gross margin was  of total revenue compared to  of total revenue in the same quarter of  the increase in gross margin compared to the prior year was driven primarily by higher product revenue in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of  gross margin included  in unused product or  of product revenue in the fourth quarter of  as compared to  in unused product or  of product revenue in the fourth quarter of  historically the cost of unused product has averaged approximately  of product revenue with modest volatility in this item on a quartertoquarter basis over time fourth quarter operating expenses increased  to  million or  yearoveryear sales and marketing expense accounted for  of that increase rd expense decreased  or  compared to last year and general and administrative expense increased  million or  yearoveryear due primarily to patent litigation expense indiscernible consultant expense and severance and other expenses related to the ceo transition net loss was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share for the same period last year for the  month period ended december  total revenue increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported basis and  on a constant currency basis this growth was driven by an increase in product revenue of  million or  on a reported basis and  on a constant currency basis offset by a  million decrease in royalty revenue due to lump sum payments received upon the signing of patent license agreements in the second quarter of  us product revenue increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear rest of world product revenue increased  million to  million or  yearoveryear on a reported basis and increased  on a constant currency basis total  was impacted by approximately  due to changes in foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year gross margins for the  months of  was  of total revenue compared to  of total revenue in the prior year prior year included  basis points in gross margin related to royalty revenue resulting in product gross margin in  of  compared to  in  gross margin included  million in unused product while  of product revenue in  as compared to  million in unused product or  of product revenue in  net loss from the  months period was  million or  per share for  compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for  net loss per basic share calculations assume weighted average basic shares outstanding of  million for  compared to  million in the same period last year the increase in shares related to the issuance of shares in the  initial public offering and the conversion of outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock turning to a discussion of our  financial guidance which we introduced in this afternoons press release for the full year  the company expects total revenue in a range of  million to  million representing yearoveryear growth of zero to  on a reported basis and  to  on a constant currency basis the companys  revenue guidance assumes the following total revenue includes royalty revenue of approximately  related to ongoing patent license royalty revenue product revenue in a range of  million to  million representing yearoveryear growth of zero to  on a reported basis and  to  on a constant currency basis our product revenue constant currency growth of  to  assumes growth at the midpoint of our guidance in the high single digit percentage and a decline at the midpoint of our guidance and the rest of the world in the high teens on a constant currency basis let me provide some additional color regarding our  product revenue growth which is impacted from two items of note first as discussed during our first quarter  earnings call those results benefitted from delayed surgeries due to the recall in  we estimate that this is to be  this is approximately  million in sales primarily related to the reduction of order lead times from  weeks to  weeks and to a lesser extent the rescheduled cases impacting our  product revenue growth by approximately  basis points second due to the change in the customized partial knee replacement reimbursement code in germany effective january  our  expectations for product revenue in rest of the world have been lowered by approximately  million we expect the change in the customized partial knee replacement reimbursement code in germany to negatively impact our  product revenue growth by approximately  basis points absent these items our guidance this year would be a  to  growth rate on a constant currency basis for the full year  the company expects total gross margin in the range of  to  as compared to  in  for modeling purposes for the full year  we expect as mark mentioned earlier this is an investment year with plans to accelerate spending on commercialization activities we expect this additional investment to increase our sales and marketing expense by approximately  over  patent litigation expense of approximately  million an increase from  million in  this increase is primarily related to the interparties review proceedings initiated in conjunction with our patent litigation against smith  nephew staff ph compensation expense of approximately  million and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding with eps purposes of approximately  million shares although we are not in the practice of providing quarterly revenue guidance given the extent to which the first quarter of  revenue was positively affected by the reduction in order lead times and rescheduled cases related to the recall and the change in the customized partial knee replacement reimbursement code in germany we felt that it would be prudent for yearoveryear comparative purposes to share our expectations for revenue in the first quarter of  based on both the procedures that have already taken place and the visibility into orders we had in hand for the balance of the quarter accordingly we expect total revenue in the range of  million to  million representing yearoveryear total revenue decline of  to  on a reported basis and  to  on a constant currency basis in conjunction with this yearoveryear decline in revenue we expect our first quarter gross margin to come in below the same period last year or up  with that i will turn the call back to mark mark augusti thanks paul while i am not in a position to provide a comprehensive strategic plan after only a few weeks i would like to provide some early thoughts as i mentioned previously  will be a year for transition for conformis as i look to reposition the company for longer term growth and profitability while i am not yet ready to get very granular i can identify four strategic priorities at conformis early in the call i mentioned two of them namely we have opportunities to strengthen our commercial execution and improve our gross margin in addition we will look to invest in our people through training and talent management and we will look to innovate into new markets with new products for every new product i am reviewing various new product opportunities including the hip project while we do not plan to confirm or give more detail about our new product pipeline i can confirm that we will continue to pursue the hip regulatory clearance however actual commercialization plans remain under review now let me provide a little more color on the first two priorities namely strengthen our commercial execution and improve our gross margin first i see a need for us to establish a conformis commercial playbook a playbook that better defines our commercial strategy includes an enhanced focus around outpatient surgery cost economics and consumer awareness as we grow our business and increase market share we have to develop plans for establishing better relations with the surgeon training community as we look to include conformis surgical concepts in the training curriculum of the next generation of indiscernible surgeons we will be looking to hire specific talent that will focus on these areas second we thought it would be helpful to provide some additional details on our gross margin initiative while our ijig manufacturing process has been  vertically integrated for some time using d printing most of our implant component manufacturing is outsourced this is expected for companies of our size however it means that conformis fares high material cost with or vendors limiting our gross margin expansion we are making significant progress with our vertical integration strategy we completed the insourcing of metal tibial trays for itotal cr and itotal ps at the end of  moreover our insourcing plans for the polyinserts of itotal cr are scheduled to take effect in  with itotal ps can follow in early  we expect that this will yield a gross margin improvement in the second half of  and continue into  we have also made significant progress with the development of new processes for the d printing of our patient specific ijig using d nylon ph printers these programs are focused on d print cycle time reduction and powder utilization optimization which we believe will translate into additional gross margin improvement as well as enhance utilization of our existing fleet of d printers we believe this will reduce our capital outlays for d printers in  and onwards we have made additional progress with our design software programs in cad automation which we believe will yield further gross margin expansion in  and  we are preparing for our multiyear plan to off shore some of our cad design work starting in  which will provide additional gross margin expansion due to reductions in labor cost last but not least volume in increased overhead absorption is the third driver of our gross margin expansion strategy in addition to reductions in material and labor cost we believe volume in increased overhead absorption will continue to contribute to gross margin expansion over the next several years in short we are seeing steady progress in our operational programs which we believe will yield progressive improvements in gross margin in  and  and continue the incremental improvements in future years so in conclusion we have a great team here at conformis both in the field and at headquarters that wakes up everyday looking to help our customers and our patients we love talking about our value and telling our story our technology is slowing reaching out across orthopedics and touching many lives we are into this business for the long haul and believe we have the vision that will result in improved outcome and an overall lower cost thank you so back over to the operator terrence and we will take questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from allen gong from jp morgan your line is open allen gong this is allen on for mike so just to start off a quick one how much was the fx headwind in the quarter i know you said it but i missed it paul weiner yes it was around  i believe  yes allen gong okay and also this was really kind of the first quarter where you broke out growth rates for your base the cr duo uni business by geography and it kind of based on what i am calculating kind of implies ous for your ps business of around  million would you say that was around like flat with your third quarter results mark augusti no i think we had an increase in the ps ous as well certainly not to the extent that we have in us but there is some growth in the ous business as well on the ps allen gong okay and just to kind of close it up so one of the goals that your really kind of outlined for the first time at the jp morgan healthcare conference was really to improve the profitability of your business and you mentioned that again today you are aiming for  by the end of next year but you were really talking about a push to  gross margin over the next four to five years with the majority of improvement towards that actually in  to  so do you think you are still on track with that or do you think that goal has kind of pushed out a bit further mark augusti yes allen we definitely still have that as our target and we think we will be able to achieve it in that time frame operator thank you and our next question comes from kristen stewart from deutsche bank your line is open kristen stewart i was wondering if we could just go over the revenue and product sales guidance and i appreciate the breakouts in terms of how much the estimated was the delay in surgery from the prior q  and then the germany impact but even absent that you are still looking at  to  growth in this year clearly i guess i don’t know what the adjusted number would have been but it seems like it would have been a little bit better than that is this just kind of conservatism i guess mark just kind of coming in and still getting kind of your feet wet or just kind of because you are going to do some changes within the sales organization that that too might lead to some disruption i am just trying to get an appreciation for what more is disruption or are we just seeing a little bit more of a softening of demand because it looks like ps did quite well in the quarter and just trying to understand what the dynamics are in terms of the guidance and how we should really interpret kind of the  to  on a constant currency basis just because it seems a little soft relative to how you guys have been doing mark augusti thanks kristen this is mark appreciate the question yes i mean its important thing to ease out ph and its not really just conservatism i mean if you actually look at the last couple of quarters trends and we look out that that’s really kind of where the business has been at so its compounded by this germany effect which we have tried to provide the detail in there but the business kind of has softened to that level and one of the things i have got due coming in as i have said is kind of change the commercial execution i think this has been a good rollout we have a nice kind of ramp up as i look back over the last few years but we are going to be successful we have to continue to do even that much better at our commercial execution and its just spotty right now we have some places that are very good but we have got to be able to export that to other in the country and do well there as well kristen stewart okay so should we look at  to  as kind of this base level as the transition year and not something you will be targeting for the longer term mark augusti yes i think that’s right the issue is that its going to take more than a year probably to kick it in but i like your words i think that’s kind of the base year for this transition year and then i certainly want to target north of  longer term and think we should be able to definitely achieve that with improved commercial performance kristen stewart okay then just a question for paul with that level of growth it is pretty impressive that you are able to still see the gross margin expansion can you maybe just breakdown how you are able to achieve that in terms of different buckets i don’t know how to bet quantify that in terms of just the vertical integration versus software changes anything that might be helpful to get us more confident in terms of being able to achieve that range paul weiner sure the biggest thing we are doing as far as the biggest impact over the near term that’s really towards the second half of this year and in  its a vertical integration so as you know in the past we have been from day  we have been doing all of the manufacturing of our patients instruments we have just completed the vertical integration of the tibial trays metal tibial trays so we will start to see that improving gross margins lowering our cost in  but above and beyond that there is other projects like the polyinserts that we are bringing in house and in  we are going to make a lot of progress there we will see that progress certainly in the second half of this year and then finishing up in the first half of  so that all of the manufacturing for the most part of all the components other than the thermal component will be done internally by the middle part of  so we do expect certainly as we implement this vertical integration in the first half of this year and into beginning part of  we expect the biggest part of the appreciation in gross margin in the second half of this year and throughout  with incremental improvements in the outer years operator and our next question comes from larry biegelsen from wells fargo your line is open larry biegelsen mark you talked about some execution gaps and i think you alluded to some changes in the sales force or the incentive structure may be could you provide a little bit of color on the gaps and how you plan to address those please mark augusti so i think the first thing i would say larry is we kind of see an unevenness in performance as you can expect talent and geographically related so i think there is bit of a talent gap we have to address as well as we need to resource out the contracting and reimbursement piece so one of the significant things we have done here in the last four weeks is we have added a key talent in reimbursement to support our contracting organization we will also be looking to build out a couple of more spes which will be important for us to be able to handle the deal flow and contracting i think those of us that follow the industry contracting with the providers is just a big part of the day to day business that we have but then even the thing that’s important to tease out here these couple of other points i want to mention is with the talent changes also how you train and you target and what we have to go after because there is a certain kind of psychology around performance excuse me around conformis in converting surgeons and we kind of export those best practices across the country and we are going to be looking to do that as we finalize and rollout the playbook i think that’s important and then the other thing is we have done a little bit with the consumer awareness and i think a really good job to a certain point but i would say that in  looking back at the numbers we got more comfortable that we can do more there and that if we do more there that actually drives preferential interest in our products and we have to combine that better in the areas where we have the talent and the surgeons that can take advantage of that so then we roll in kind of that coordinated approach out across the country larry biegelsen that’s very helpful and just two more from me one on germany just looking at it on the surface it seems like a pretty big impact relative to your sales for that product line outside the us and the reimbursement is just being cut to the same as of the shelf partial procedures we are just in similar to the united states so what am i missing here does it seem like  to what percent your uni business are you assuming goes away in  and i will just throw in my third question here paul just let me push back a little bit more or ask a little more color on the gross margin the guidance is only for about  basis point yearoveryear improvement the  goal was by  it sounds like and i thought we were going to get the most improvement in  and  i know earlier you got asked the same question but you said the goal hasn’t been pushed out but it does seem like its got to ramp a lot in    to get to that  thanks for taking the questions guys mark augusti so larry let me do the germany piece and i can give some color around that and then i will let paul follow up with the gross margin so i just got back from germany to really try to asses to make sure i felt comfortable about kind of whats going forward and i will put the appropriate caveat on anything you cant plan or predict the future but you kind of do the best to be able to understand it and project whats happening what actually happened to be clear in germany is they  in germany there was one code that the conformis technology fell into for partials and totals and it was reimbursement at a certain rate they decided to create a new and separate for partials so that’s what actually happened and then they had to set the rates for that code and because they didn’t have data into the code because there is a lot of other products being reimbursement in that code from before that were more than just conformis they didn’t know what to do for the partial so what they decided to do was set it equivalent and this is for custom partials its got its own code now but its set equivalent to off the shelf and then the idea is after two years the way it works in germany so for the years of  and  they will look at whatever utilization and pricing is in that code and if they think it needs to be adjusted there is actually chance they could adjust it up or depending on whats been occurring then they keep it the same and this is what they do in germany when they look at the drgs every year every few years so that’s actually what happened importantly it didn’t affect our total business and i don’t anticipate it any code changes going forward which i got comfortable with that again the appropriate caveat is as you can imagine healthcare bodies and governmental bodies are going to do what they want to do but i feel better about that so that’s actually what happened to us and that changed the profitability profile as you can imagine for our customers because they are getting a price advantage versus off the shelf partial and so we do anticipate this will be a significant impact in  one time impact on our partial business in germany then paul you want to address the gross margin question paul weiner sure let me give you a little bit of a cadence as far as some of the numbers so as we have said first quarter because of the revenue levels in the first quarter that we are expecting in the first quarter as well as some additional vertical integration costs we have in the first quarter we are expecting our gross margins to come in certainly below  which is what we were a year ago leaving  we expect gross margins to be in the s the low to mid range so that will get us an average of somewhere between  to  gross margins for the year so that marketable improvement from certainly last year and there is more from the beginning of this year to the end of the year the average so leaving this year we are looking at again low to mid s again we expect material increases in our gross margin in  as we complete the vertical integration of the rest of the implant components as well as we will be further on in the expansion of the off shoring of cad as well as some software automation equipment and increasing efficiency in the machines so  we expect a big improvement and then that will lead us incremental improvements in those future years to get us to in or around  operator and our next question comes from steven lichtman from oppenheimer and co your line is open steven lichtman so just my two questions are on the us mark mentioned a couple of initiatives specifically would help economics in outpatient surgery can you flesh that out a little bit what is the type or work that you anticipate going on there to help drive acceleration in the medium to longterm mark augusti so first off the other initiatives apply broader which is around the commercial execution and the consumer awareness but specifically our early results on health economics steve i think are very compelling and so we have to do a good job in getting those published we also have to do a good job at reproducing them at other centers so we will be working on both those front in  and beyond to do that and then in particular around outpatient knee surgery right now there is a lot of discussion in there and there is various estimates but we will say its early days in outpatient total knee surgery but we believe that our model with the reduced sets and all the infrastructure that comes around that with that doesn’t come with us that does exist with the off the shelf though will allow sites to enable through outpatient knee surgery we have got early data that shows we have got a higher rate of discharge within  hours and we have got a higher rate of discharge to home versus a step down facility we think those are big things so we are looking to identifying qualified sites in places where they want to do this and who knows where cms will go on the reimbursement but we want to be in a position to capture that because we believe this will be a growing of importance in the marketplace and when you combine this with consumer awareness and i think the brand allegiance that we can command around conformis i just view it where i am sitting today early days as a big opportunity for us and we have to put ourselves out there as the best solution for customers around outpatient knee surgery steven lichtman thanks for that mark and then just my second question is you mentioned in terms of some of the investments adding some people in this area also on the reimbursement front will you also be adding to the direct sales force in the us i wasn’t clear on that and if so about how much you would think you would expand here this year mark augusti well as you know we don’t give the specific numbers but i can tell you absolutely we do plan to add direct reps in the us in  and we are well on our way of identifying geographies and where we are going to do that operator and our next question comes from bruce nudell from suntrust your line is open bruce nudell mark the investor expectations for the company was only  market share in the us and a lot of that disproportionately uni we are probably north of  at this stage of the company and one of the things that investors are going to be worried about is are there market frictions that the company didn’t anticipate so for instance over half of patients in the us who get primary knees are medicare and they are reimbursed at half the commercial rates and hence  and there is demand matching that goes on in a lot of hospitals hence the price point of the conformis implant could be problematic are there like specific market frictions that the company didn’t realize fully until you showed up and how could you speak to that investors concerns that this really has broadbase appeal and then i have a follow up mark augusti sure bruce that’s a great question and obviously well aware as i said earlier i also have those expectations and i think we need to get it there but having said that look its a competitive market i will say this and i have said this before i mean there are good strong competitors that we go up against we happen to believe we think we have got a better technology and there is a real compelling interest in it given our gross margin of product standpoint we do maintain a firm line on price and we do a pretty good job on that and so that doesn’t mean that there is some business that we turned down that we cant compete everywhere and we are not going to be able to compete there until we solve for the gross margins that’s why its critical that we do both of these simultaneously and i will say bruce there are plenty of areas where we still are able to really create an economic story around our product and so there is still an opportunity to grow there but there is no doubt that its a market dynamic that we have to take into account bruce nudell and then i guess just given the slower growth rate and you mentioned the tbg with regards to commercialization of the hip what is the anticipated cash burn over the next several years and what are the measures you could take to conserve cash and basically provide the proof of principle in the us primary knee market which is key for the investment hypothesis for instance do you really need europe i mean why bother mark augusti let me give you the dollar amount and then mark can follow up with certainly some of the things that we can look at during the year and the upcoming year the cash burn that we would ignoring the fact that we obviously have the  million debt financing that we can borrow off of you are looking at cash used from operations as well as capital equipment in  of somewhere in the neighborhood of  million or a little bit south of that number that’s based on you know on where it stands today before mark obviously completes his evaluation and then moving forward certainly as our revenues increase and we tighten up our operating expenses that number we expect to decrease one of the things that we should look at and consider is the capital equipment needs is as we do the vertical integration so in the past here in  and  what we did invest in new equipment to do this vertical integration in the future years we would expect our capital equipment needs to decrease substantially relative to that mark augusti and i guess i would just say look there is no doubt that there is areas we could change the expense trajectory to conserve cash if we wanted to i am more interested in making sure we got the right growth plans in place and looking about and making sure we can continue to execute on the profitability in the cog your point about europe is well taken and that’s one of the reasons why you don’t hear me talking a lot about going into other international markets and certainly we will be very preferential to any opportunity around there around the right price point because i think as you all know again its due to the industry pricing is really challenged in the international markets especially in europe so its something to look at having said that you know bruce i am loathe to want to do anything to kind of impact that business at this point because once you have entered the market you have built that infrastructure you have got that customer loyalty its hard to get back i would rather work on product profitability and some other stuff to make that business more profitable and kind of keep it where it is but that’s just me being very transparent in my early days about how i think about that so i don’t think we are in a stage yet where we have to make drastic actions around our germany and uk business operator and we have a follow up question from kristen stewart from deutsche bank your line is open kristen stewart i was wondering if you would be willing to share just some more anecdotal comments just around your discussion with physicians in the quarter just with the launch or roll out of ps and just more on the order flows and how things are tracking or taking out of it just kind of the lumpiness on a year to year basis just kind of the underlying trends of the business have you i guess lost a number of physicians are you thinking about adding i guess lost a number of sales people just kind of more trends like that rather than to kind of talking more contextually about the guidance and cash flow trends more subjective measures that you can share with us mark augusti yes i can kris so first off there is not from my standpoint any anecdotal worrisome trend about two of the key things you mentioned which is loss the us knee surgeons or loss of reps we clearly like all companies want to manage the performance and we will do that both at the rep level and the manager level i think it is always a work for talent in finding good orthopedic talent across the board is hard and you have to be really targeted about your market anecdotally my surgeons what i have said in my prepared remarks i will reiterate here review anecdotally is you know what i love about conformis is people love the technology i literally havent had a single conversation with a surgeon that suggested somehow they were unhappy with our technology or somehow they couldn’t or wouldn’t incorporate their practice as a matter of fact we have surgeons routinely coming through the office for headquarters visit we continually do that add and there is a lot of continued interest in the product both at the surgeon level and as i had mentioned at the consumer level and those anecdotes are very strong now there is no doubt we are a small company and we have a smaller group of for us high value surgeons and if one of those surgeons takes two weeks to go on a ski vacation or runs into a health issue that certainly can adversely affect us for the short time and we will see that and i get as a ceo i get those stories anecdotally a lot but no real challenges where core customers for whatever reason has decided to move away from conformis kristen stewart and just with respect to the itotal ps launch are the incremental sales still truly of ps so truly incremental or are you seeing any cannibalization from cr i would imagine that they are incremental but checking mark augusti yes no that’s a really good question thanks because i actually wanted to point that out i mean i think we have said it in the remarks but ps will be still be an important areas of growth for us and it opens up a much larger market for us i think it would probably  its obvious at some level there is a little bit of cannibalization from some guys that have been doing cr because they like conformis and then want to go back to doing ps i don’t think we have broken that out and i am not sure we actually nearly even could quantify that because as was detailed that wouldn’t make sense and its not materials so we see ps as a big source of growth for us but we also believe we will continue to be an important player in cr and that’s really the bigger business and clearly as a result its performance is its certainly not growing as fast as the ps i don’t know if you want to comment more paul paul weiner yes the other thing to look at kristen is we have our sales reps spending their time so there is one regarding some limited cannibalization amongst our surgeons the other thing is as far as where our reps and we don’t incentivize them more to sell ps then the pr but the ps is such a big opportunity and a new opportunity within the existing territories that the reps are already covering that yes some of their time certainly that was spent before solely on pr and the partial is now being spent on ps so that begs the question how do we expand our sales force to be able to cover the potential growth in ps and still pay attention and grow our base business kristen stewart okay and then just going back i guess my original question because i just want to make sure i completely understand as i am having a hard time just reconciling all if it doesn’t seem like you have lost physicians and havent lost reps and momentum still feels good and you have got sizable ps and all of that i guess i am just having a hard time wrapping my head around this  to  growth mark augusti so the way i think about it and again its hard to quantify this and think about it but i think to process to acquiring the surgeon at conformis is pretty lengthy if you think about it because we are getting in it about all the time upfront that we take to get them psychologically ready to want to make the change kristen as then they got to put their first case and wait of course six weeks for the case and lets be charitable and say maybe they even put a couple but then they want to leave another six weeks or so to see those patients in clinic to see how they are doing so right there you are talking about  weeks which is  months and when i really talk to people and think about  and i hate to go back and do this because i don’t want to be forward looking but what really happened to us with the recall that was more pernicious is it threw that cadence of surgeon acquisition off and it forced our reps to actually spend a lot of time homing on to the business going with customer satisfaction issues all through kind of  then we start to get some of those guys back but then whats happened is that cadence of acquiring new surgeons really got hit and part of what i think that effect is its kind of through that misstep off and we have got to get that pipeline and that cadence back so i don’t think about the growth our core surgeons are actually for the most part still with us i think for a large part still with us and that’s giving a growth but what we are not really seeing is that next uptick of these new surgeons where you are going to then come in give us a significant part of the business and that rate has fallen off and so that’s part of the work that we have to do with  and to build that back up and be smart about that and get new surgeons in the fold
