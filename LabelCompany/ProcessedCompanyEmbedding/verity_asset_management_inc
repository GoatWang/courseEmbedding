inc verity investments inc realitybased investing investment philosophy our investment philosophy is derived from three primary considerations we have observed over many years the inclination of markets to deviate sometimes dramatically from any reasonably definable measure of value or other meaningful metric an advantage may be gained by investing in targeted sectors or securities based upon sound underlying fundamentals or in recognition of market pricing anomalies particularly where there are emerging or established trends supported by those factors the most reliable way to maximize the probability of better than average long term results is to identify opportunity in those areas that are mispriced while systematically avoiding severe downturns in portfolio value as a consequence we seek to maximize absolute returns using a broad tactical asset allocation methodology implemented in coordination with multiple risk management strategies ﻿ itt inc itt downgraded by bidaskclub to
