balanced fund a balanced fund combines a stock component a bond component and sometimes a money market component in a single portfolio generally these hybrid funds stick to a relatively fixed mix of stocks and bonds that reflects either a moderate or higher equity component or conservative or higher fixedincome component orientation breaking down balanced fund balanced funds are geared toward investors who are looking for a mixture of safety income and modest capital appreciation the amounts this type of mutual fund invests into each asset class usually must remain within a set minimum and maximumalthough they are in the asset allocation family balanced fund portfolios do not materially change their asset mix this is unlike lifecycle targetdate and actively managed assetallocation funds which make changes in response to an investors changing riskreturn appetite and age or overall investment market conditionsequities and inflationinvestors who have dual investment objectives favor balanced funds typically retirees or investors with low risk tolerance utilize these funds for growth that outpaces inflation and income that supplements current needs while retirees generally scale back risk as age advances many individuals recognize the need for equity exposure as life expectancies increase while the equity holdings of a balanced fund tend to lean toward large dividendpaying companies those issues typically provide longterm total returns that track the sp  index historically inflation has averaged about  while the sp  averaged about  from  through  equities prevent erosion of purchasing power and help ensure longterm preservation of retirement nest eggsincome needsthe bond component of a balanced fund serves two purposes creating an income stream and tempering portfolio volatility investmentgrade bonds such as aaa corporate issues and us treasurys provide interest income from semiannual payments while largecompany stocks offer quarterly dividend payouts to enhance yield retired investors may take distributions in cash to bolster income from pensions personal savings and government subsidiessecondarily bonds and treasurys hold much less volatility than stocks bondholders have a claim against assets of a company while stocks represent ownership bearing all inherent risk if bankruptcy occurs hence debt security prices do not move in lockstep with equities and their stability prevents wild swings in the share price of a balanced fundbalanced fund performance examplethe vanguard balanced index fund has a belowaverage risk rating from morningstar with an aboveaverage reward profile through  years ending june   the fund holding about 0 stock and 0 bonds has returned  on average with a  trailing month yield trading center growth and income fund
