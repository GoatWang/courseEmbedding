department the president and ceo of boeing commercial airplanes and executive vice president of the boeing company during the most important period of launching and promoting new design products daft  lane  albaugh has finished serving as an executive vice president of the boeing company on the st of october  and celebrated his  years of committed work at the innovative and successful company bloomberg businessweek  albaugh holds bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics and master’s degree in civil engineering daft  lane  the leader saw new approach of communication through external and internal blogs which are the main options of the company’s success daft  lane  the boeing company can be assessed as a customeroriented enterprise that is focused on innovation design and craftsmanship of its staff sterling  james f albaugh’s leadership style was a combination of the management and leadership because he modeled the company’s leadership attributes measured by combinations of goals which were focused on the accomplishment of profit margins daft  lane  the following facts prove the abovementioned statement a on july  the boeing reported net income of   million b the boeing gained first position in the aeronautical studies due to its creative and innovative approach to the aircrafts’ and spacecrafts’ maintenance modifications and designs evans   since the main value of the boeing company is to create an atmosphere that gives all employees the chance to make difference albaugh’s main tasks were the following a establishment of the direction which was focused on the growth of  boeing family airplanes and launching of boeing  dreamliner b setting of high expectations and inspiration of others which were focused on designing of the supersonic aircrafts in the stateofart facilities in cooperation with other entities around the world c respecting of the boeing’s values which were focused on the reducing of costs and avoiding of the spreading of the commercial and economic risks that were associated with the design and manufacturing of these aircrafts d delivering results which were focused on the development of modifications for the  family materials such as new electrical system for fanjets and rocket engines which would enable the aircraft to fly at the high subsonic speed pelletier  sterling  these attributes equals to the goals of transformational leader that creates a vision aligns people motivates and inspires them and produces changes sterling  northouse  therefore albaugh could serve as a role model to stimulate the followers to think about existing methods in new ways hughes  beatty  thereby his strategic leadership helped him to gain success inside and outside of the corporation james f albaugh – a leader and an engineer of the year  albaugh participated in the manufacturing and launching of two new jetliners which are the  dreamliner and  intercontinental drexel university  the dreamliner is called the first airplane in the st century that features the innovative use of composite materials and fuelefficient engines pelletier  in order to finish the final assembly of  intercontinental albaugh had to make sufficient impact on the technology and engineering of the project using his coordinated management behavior effective team’s coaching and essential strategies of transformational leader daft  lane  the boeing company is known for outsourcing of its manufacturing business that made its supply chain globally dispersed pelletier  when the company faced delay of the products’ delivery owing to their partners’ manufacturing irresponsibility albaugh had to focus on bringing the site’s business systems and manufacturing process into the line with the rest of the company pelletier  the attributes of his corporate leadership helped him to regain control over the company agenda and motivate his subordinates to continue with manufacturing the airplane on the existing charleston plants pelletier  sterling  albaugh’s individual cultivation of knowledge and business helped him to encourage close connection between goals and rewards as motivation for the workers to provide better performance daft  lane  therefore he had to perform the character of transactional leader in order to combine attributes of the transformational leader and define managerial importance in the company’s technological development and proficient performance daft  lane  albaugh’s persistence education and management behavior helped him to become the president of the boeing company in  drexel university  in  drexel university’s college of engineering selected albaugh as a leader of the year for his engineering and managerial innovations and achievements drexel university  albaugh’s quality of organizational strategy and excellent management activities helped to create favorable environment for innovative development of the committed workforce of team members sterling  gender conception and workplace culture effect on albaugh’ success scholars assume gender as important element of the comprehensive understanding of the leadership northouse  gender determines contemporary notions of effective leadership styles that have moved from traditional autocratic style to more democratic transformational leadership northouse  autocratic style is based solely on effective managerial activities and creates order and consistency in maintaining status quo daft  lane  this style does not take into account longterm goals and does not compromise human values and principles daft  lane  transformational leadership was effective when the boeing’s employees went on strike and the company’s management had to redesign job and align internal structures and systems to make them meaningful and challenging daft  lane  pelletier  regardless the fact that female employees prefer supportive leadership and maledirective leadership albaugh shifted emphasis from controlling the organization to constantly regenerating motivations to work and stay organized sterling  therefore it is fair to say that gender did not fully impact on albaugh’s success because autocratic style would not have helped boeing’s organizational evolution when it faced threat of decline pelletier  the company was in demand of creating new vision recruiting commitment to it and changing the organizational culture daft  lane  workplace culture requires compliance to the established values concepts and systems hughes  beatty  the boeing’s workforce is organized and coordinated on the ground of the boeing leadership model sterling  this model is a value that holds leaders accountable for their performance and determines efficiency of the concept “leaders teaching leaders” sterling  the concept offers greater incentives across all the departments to encourage collaborative work within technical teams hughes  betty  albaugh possessed attributes of the business leader technical coordinator and commands of the boeing leadership center blc daft  lane  sterling  as a ceo he offered core leadership development and functional excellence programs that were constantly reviewed and updated sterling  as a system blc enables its subordinates to create kitting strategies and project work transfers daft  lane  therefore james f albaugh took personal ownership of the leadership attributes although his managerial activities depended on the workplace environment daft  lane  hughes  betty  however albaugh’s main task was to bring together members and suppliers of the boeing’s aircraft projects and embrace boeing’s strategic decision sterling  his engineering and managerial skills helped him cultivate knowledge more effectively and share it on the group level in order to convert ideas into the marketable products daft  lane  albaugh’s innovative approach to the design of the product and its implementation helped him to gain awards owing to his technical and business knowledge drexel university  regardless the fact that albaugh finished serving as an executive vice president of the boeing company in  his extensive experience in manufacturing and development of the

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
