assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call whether as a result of new information or future results now well hear from vic victor l lund  teradata corp thank you gregg our discussions todate have laid out our strategy which is business outcomeled and technology enabled this strategy is extremely relevant today customers face many challenges driving highimpact business outcomes from data and analytics and they need help our strategy is focused on our customers success we help customers prioritize and deliver their highest impact analytic use cases we ensure that our customers deploy the best fit architectures to meet their unique data and analytic priorities and we implement support and manage the most integrated and scalable analytical ecosystem technology to ensure our customers can build lasting analytic capabilities today im going to give a brief update on our progress first and foremost our customers love the capabilities of terdata software and our teams that support it however a year ago they didnt like our pricing and deployment rigidity especially regarding our ability to deploy in the cloud in olivers comments he will discuss how we have addressed these concerns additionally we found our customers are laserfocused on figuring out the type of analytical ecosystem they need analytical ecosystems have become more complex as they have expanded to include among other things data warehouses data lakes and multiple cloud offerings our customers want advice from people they trust to help them understand and navigate this complicated puzzle the goal is to deliver business outcomes they need in todays competitive environment in a costefficient way given our experience and knowledge we are uniquely qualified to serve their needs our customers are among the worlds  largest analytically driven companies many of them require purposebuilt analytic solutions that meet the unique needs of their respective businesses solutions that have the capability to seamlessly interface with and process analytics in an increasingly diverse ecosystem this not only speeds up the time to develop solutions that are rich in insight but also supports consistent data being used across multiple use cases thereby delivering higher confidence in the outcomes we continue to make sure teradata software remains in the leadership position when customers think about data and analytics this continues to be validated by industry analysts in fact so far this year teradata has been named a leader in six key industry analyst reports this recognition spans vision products service and how teradata supports our customer but more relevant is how our customers view teradata our customers tell us no one can compete with teradata in delivering integrated analytics at scale we are the partner that gives our customers maximum flexibility in delivering their unique purposebuilt solutions not ours but theirs consulting is also an important part of the value we deliver for our customers we are focused on consulting that supports our customers while directly or indirectly driving consumption of teradata software our consulting teams are able to provide advice and deliver purposebuilt analytics business solutions as well as designing delivering and managing the underlying bestfit analytical ecosystem our customers know that we have the experience and capabilities to make them successful and want us to engage in both areas turning now to gotomarket we know a key to our success is the people who engage with our customers like the software and consulting discussed above we have transformed our gotomarket approach our sales teams have developed account plans focused on delivering highimpact business outcomes and are approaching our top customers with a businessled approach as i said in the last call when we engage our customers in this way we are finding the discussions become more about benefits than cost and lead to a sustainable relationship we believe the teradata we are building will be at the nexus in the future integrated analytics based on integrated data via an agile data foundation and delivered at scale our customers are receptive to the new teradata strategy this is evidenced by our increased funnel and our momentum which positions us well for the last half of  and a strong start to  all of this sounds great but we understand you want metrics that will demonstrate our strategy is delivering results now and will continue to do so in the future in his comments steve will lay out the metrics that will allow you to just that but before oliver gives his presentation i want you to know that we have turned the corner and we are more confident in our strategy than we have ever been oliver oliver ratzesberger  teradata corp good morning everyone its an exciting time to be at teradata im very pleased to share with you the progress we have made how our customers are reacting to our new strategy and to demonstrate the confidence we have internally at teradata we have created an amazing new company with a new strategy focused on driving high impact business outcomes for our customers and returning teradata to meaningful revenue growth our new strategy is focused on providing our customers flexibility and choice making it easier for them to purchase teradatas marketleading analytics solutions i meet with many of our current and prospective customers and they love that our solutions are now more affordable and our purchasing options are more flexible than ever before as a result we are seeing increasing momentum and activity that sets us up well for the end of  and into  a foundational element of our strategy is teradata everywhere we created teradata everywhere to help customers meet their data and analytic needs today and in the future teradata everywhere provides our customers three core benefits first we are enabling our customers to implement teradata across flexible deployment options including public private managed clouds and onpremises deployments our customers can deploy on their hardware our purposebuilt teradata platforms or public cloud infrastructures second our solutions can now be purchased in more accommodating ways with our simplified pricing bundles that address the needs of different customer use cases at different price points all pricing bundles are delivered through subscriptionbased pricing and as the service options and third teradata everywhere is futureready customers can take advantage of our affordable licensing to change where they run their teradata software as their hybrid cloud needs evolve through a combination off our marketleading technology in teradata everywhere and our highly regarded business and technology consulting teams we are delivering on a broad range of new business use cases these use cases are opening new areas for us to sell our technology our consultants help customers identify and build roadmaps for new analytic opportunities determine the right architecture and deployment options to fit each customers unique needs and deliver businessfocused valuecreating analytics all leading to increased consumption of teradata software the business outcomes we enable for our customers are wideranging and a few of the recent use cases that we are delivering with our customers include member churning and specialty pharmacy analytics for healthcare company raw materials and yield optimization for a semiconductor manufacturer and natural language processing for better speech recognition and document classification to improve process automation at a retail bank customers are now considering teradata in areas where they previously had not and this is significantly increasing our opportunities now i want to highlight some of the advances we have made in our technology that are helping us execute teradata everywhere and build momentum with customers first we provide the same fullfeatured teradata database software regardless of the deployment options a customer chooses in public private or managed clouds as well as onpremises and with portable database licenses customers have the flexibility to expand or modify their hybrid cloud environments by moving licenses between deployment options as their business evolves this flexibility and portability is clearly helping our customers move forward on transactions as we now take the risk of making purchase decisions customers know that their needs will change over time and rather than be paralyzed while trying to determine their future architectures they can buy today with confidence knowing that the teradata database functionality is the same across deployment options and that the database software licenses are portable and with our simplified pricing tiers and subscriptionbased licenses it is easy for customers to get started quickly and affordably and pay as they go instead of working through a long capital approval process while this is a tremendous benefit for customers it is also great for teradata we are seeing customers adopt subscription licenses more rapidly than expected and this is building future recurring product revenue for us turning to our leading teradata intelliflex platform we took a technological leap forward and made intelliflex  based on solid state drives we know that customers continually require substantial gains in their data warehouse compute power to serve the needs of their missioncritical advanced analytics and we specifically designed intelliflex to meet these demands the new intelliflex all in memory appliance delivers a massive increase in processing power in fact seven times more compute power per cabinet than our previous product with intelliflex we are providing our customers with more performance storage and memory while reducing costly datacenter space and saving energy costs and it is generating a lot of interest and activity one example a global leader in the semiconductor industry is leveraging intelliflex and our consulting services to help them improve the yield and quality of the chips it produces a  cumulative yield improvement can translate to  million of savings and we executed that proofofconcept that demonstrate this yield improvement is achievable in the second quarter this customer purchased intelliflex and took advantage of our flexible subscriptionbased licensing which made it easier and more affordable for them to purchase more teradata we also launched teradata intellicloud our managed cloud offering that provides data and analytics softwareasaservice this nextgeneration cloud service ensures that our customers can leverage the same software ecosystem applications tools and training that they have already invested in for their onpremises teradata systems with intellicloud customers can focus on driving business outcomes rather than matching infrastructure we are deploying intellicloud in our data centers as well as on amazons aws and microsofts azure public cloud infrastructures we are gaining considerable traction with our intellicloud offering and cloud activity in our sales funnel has increased significantly in the last few months one of our customers a leading global consumer goods company is focused on improving analytics to optimize their consumer promotions improve sales planning enhance supplier contract negotiations and strengthen their executive reporting this customer is focused on moving their data and analytics to the public cloud and they purchased our intellicloudasaservice offering on aws the customer is also relying upon our enterprise data consulting organization for cloud architecture migration planning and implementation we also recently announced our readytorun teradata intellibase a revolutionary multipurpose platform that supports several software technologies on a redeployable hardware at a low price point intellibase enables a teradata database aster analytics and hadoop to run in the same cabinet a true allinone engineered solution intellibase provides the versatility for a customer to repurpose hardware to meet tomorrows business requirements this provides ultimate flexibility and investment protection for customers despite intellibase being engineered as a lowcost alternative this makes the new platform extremely efficient and economical and therefore extremely attractive to our customers an sp  healthcare company purchased intellibase in q to complement its enterprise class teradata system intellibase will be its analytical platform to support cost of care analytics for its medicaid and medicare business by the structured and unstructured data this customer also leveraged business and analytic consulting provided by our think big analytics organization to strengthen our agile build and delivery capabilities we recently acquired the san diego startup stackiq a leader in opensource software provisioning stackiq will help accelerate adoption of teradata ecosystem and cloud offerings by simplifying and automating the delivery and deployment of teradata products this intellectual property also supports rapid reprovisioning of our intellicloud infrastructure internal test and benchmarking hardware as well as swift redeployment between technologies to match a customers changing requirements as i close i want to reinforce why we are so enthusiastic about the progress we have made and the momentum we have built going into the second half of the year customers are recognizing that teradata is different we are easier to do business with and customers now have more ways than ever to deploy and purchase teradata as a result customers are now considering teradata for a full range of use cases that we may never have been considered for previously this is because of our wide range of deployment options and our new simplified pricing tiers at different price points we have turned the corner on delivering the flexibility and choice that the customers want and this is showing up in our sales funnel as we now engage in new analytic use cases and customers are able to move forward now on purchases because we derisk their buying decisions they no longer need to sweat their assets while they decide on their future analytic architecture direction they can buy today this is enabled by the combination of our multiple deployment options our portable software licenses and because customers can buy in smaller payasyougo increments via our subscriptionbased pricing as a result we are seeing increasing momentum in customer activity our sales funnel is growing and is much higher than it was before our strategy changes subscription licenses are being adopted faster than expected and we are seeing customers seriously consider and adopt our cloud options this all builds recurring product revenue which positions us well for the future as i said at the start the changes around teradata are nothing short of amazing and im excited to be part of this transformation thank you stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp thanks oliver and good morning our strategy is working and providing customers greater flexibility in how they deploy and consume teradata including our subscriptionbased options however our reported financial result doesnt quite tell this whole story as the impact of this transition particularly as it relates to our revenue i want to provide you my perspective on our second quarter financial results when adjusted for an increasing mix of subscriptionbased transactions this perspective is based on our analysis as it relates to specific transactions that had transitioned to subscriptionbased options when i discussed our expectations for the second quarter on our q earnings call our estimates for reported q revenue were in the range of  million to  million which assumed that well do approximately  million to  million of perpetual equivalent transactions converting to our subscription options said another way our analysis indicated that our q revenue when combined with the perpetual equivalent transactions would approximate  million to  million on a total perpetual equivalent basis when looking at our q results you see  million of reported revenue what you dont see is the impact of customers that shows our subscriptionbase to options in the second quarter during q we had  million of subscriptionbased perpetual equivalent transactions or  million higher than the high end of our  million to  million expected range combining our reported revenue with this  million results in a total of  million slightly above the high end of our perpetual equivalent range of  million to  million this clearly demonstrates the increasing demand for teradatas products in fact we believe that the total perpetual equivalent for product revenue has bottomed out and we expect an increase in total perpetual equivalent product revenue in the second half of  yearoveryear as well as versus the first half now as it relates to eps the expectations we previously provided for the second quarter was a range of  to  our nongaap eps in q was  just as you would expect an increase in the amount of activity moving from perpetual to subscription negatively impacts eps in the reported quarter as well our analysis indicates that our q nongaap eps could have been  higher if the  million worth of transactions above our expected  million to  million range had been traditionally structured when you add this estimated  impact plus the  effective tax rate timing impact that ill discuss later we would be at the high end of our eps expectation range of  to  for q to provide some visibility into our progress in q our key performance metrics include revenue from upgrade subscriptions in cloud increased  in constant currency recurring revenue of  million saw a  increase in constant currency from q  by the way our recurring revenue is a very profitable piece of our total revenue the gross margin rate on our recurring revenue is higher than our nongaap product gross margin which was  for the first half of  finally business consulting which helps customers identify new business use cases and as a result should increase the consumption of teradata increased more than  from q  revenue for the full year we expect the following approximately  million to  million of gross perpetual equivalent to shift to subscriptionbased transactions during  in fact we had  million of gross perpetual equivalent shift in the first half annual recurring revenue or arr of  billion by the end of the year with about a third of that being product arr product arr to grow approximately  for  recurring revenue to grow highsingledigits in  business consulting revenue to grow approximately  in  and tcore growth of almost  based off of our  year installed base now looking at our regions in the americas our sales cycles are beginning to shorten and were becoming more predictable with time with our sales funnel is increasing the americas revenue decreased  in constant currency versus q  however majority of the subscriptionbased transactions signed in q were in the americas our international region had a good quarter including international customers starting to utilize our subscription options as well revenue increased  in constant currency and  yeartodate turning to margins product gross margin in the second quarter was  on a comparable basis product gross margin in q  was  the improvement in product gross margin was largely due to favorable product mix in part due to more customers purchasing our intelliflex offering rather than our prior  series appliance services gross margin in the quarter was  a decrease from  in q  services margin was impacted by the investments we are making in our consulting business which as we have discussed before is a driver of our businessled strategy to drive and increase consumption of teradatas products as we said last quarter these investments will impact services gross margin throughout the course of the year services margin was also impacted by utilization rates as well as the work in process issue we described last quarter as a result overall gross margin was  in q compared to  in q  turning to operating expenses sga expense of  million was up  from q  as we are now starting to compare against prior period when we were reducing costs and now are reinvesting those savings more appropriately to support our new strategy correspondingly rd was up meaningfully as expected as weve continued to invest in cloud development and other areas of rd compared to q  rd expense of  million was  million or  higher our nongaap effective tax rate for the second quarter was  versus  in the same period  the increase in the effective tax rate periodoverperiod was largely driven by the higher percentage rate of normal discrete items driven by the lower pretax earnings denominator periodoverperiod however on an annualized basis we expect our full year nongaap effective tax rate to be approximately  we expect q nongaap tax rate to be in the lows with the q nongaap tax rate to be in the midteens to result in the expected  rate for  turning to cash flow we had another solid quarter in terms of cash flow generation net cash provided by operating activities was  million in q  compared to the  million generated in q  however cash flow generations in q was better than we expected after  million of capital expenditures versus  million in q  and  million of additions to capitalized software versus  million in q  we generated  million of free cash flow versus a  million of free cash flow generated in q  although increased investments as well as lower revenue contributed to lower free cash flow yearoveryear free cash flow for both the quarter and yeartodate was better than we expected we expect our full year free cash flow to be at least  million as a remainder we typically generate the majority of our free cash flow in the first part of the year and in this case we are investing in the future of teradata free cash flow for the second half could very well be negative after the  million of free cash flow generated in the first half as a reminder that  million was the high end of our expected free cash flow for the full year as teradatas customers continue to shift to the companys new cloud and subscriptionbased offerings it is difficult to estimate how much full year  reported revenue could be impacted by the ratable manner in which revenue is recognized for these new purchasing options furthermore as we get closer to  adoption of asc  this may begin to impact how transactions are structured in the second half of  in order to minimize loss revenue however given our current view of our sales activity we are updating our forecast for full year reported revenue to now be down approximately  to  which is better than our prior view that  reported revenue could be down  to  from  also keep in mind we expect  million to  million of perpetual equivalent to be structured in subscriptionbased transactions correspondingly we expect nongaap eps to be in the range of  to  for the full year prior to any benefit from the share repurchase activity we planned for the second half again we think eps will be more weighted to the fourth quarter much more than is typically the case in fact q overall could look at lot like q or either a little lower but we expect a very strong fourth quarter as we see our new strategy really start to show signs of success now let me go over some of our other operational expectations for the full year we estimate that product gross margin will be in the mids services gross margin is estimated to be in the mids as we continue to invest in our services business to pull through future product revenue we estimate that sga will be up highsingledigits on a percentage basis as we hire additional sales and sales support resources and invest in our infrastructure as planned rd expense is likely to increase  to  versus  as we invest heavily in cloud and core analytical solutions as expected for companies going through this type of business transformation the first year or two are generally challenging from an asreported basis but companies build on the recurring revenue model for a stronger and more predictable future years  is clearly that type of building year for teradata but let me be very clear we are very confident that our new strategy is working and will result in a much stronger company therefore i want to share with you some of the preliminary  targets that we are contemplating based on what were seeing through the end of q and based on our current assumptions that we are applying indicates that our analysis â our analysis indicates that total perpetual equivalent product revenue is expected to bottom out in  and that we should see more benefits to our strategy in  this early view is before any of the impacts of asc  and any changes in our underlying transition to subscription assumptions our early assessment for  includes total perpetual equivalent is expected to increase  over  and  over  product arr should continue to grow in the mid with almost  million of incremental product arr in  and we continue to expect total revenue growth in  while still transitioning activity to the subscriptionbased pricing model youve heard vic and oliver describe how our new strategy transformation and execution have strongly positioned us to drive increasing business value for our customers through analytics this is demonstrated by the growth of our sales funnel as customers are embracing our hybrid cloud deployment and pricing consumption options and as a result we are even more confident in our strategy and plan to acquire up to  million of our stock during the second half of  and with that operator we are ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question this morning comes from wamsi mohan from bank of america please go ahead wamsi mohan  bank of america merrill lynch yes thank you good morning your perpetual equivalent guidance for the back half suggests that you can have up to  higher perpetual equivalent in second half versus first half which would suggest that youre significantly accelerating the move to subscription revenues and oliver had mentioned customers are now looking at new analytic use cases where you would not have been considered before can you share some examples of this and do you feel now that conclusively customer purchasing is shifting more towards subscription and i have a quick follow up victor l lund  teradata corp yeah wamsi let me take the first part then ill turn to oliver on the use cases but yes wamsi what were seeing in the second half is clearly what we see in building in the funnel is more activity going towards these deployment consumption options on the subscription basis particularly in the americas and were actually seeing that activity picking up in internationally more so in the second half so again a strong adoption of these consumption models and were seeing net increase in the sales funnel in the americas and the international and even to the extent that were looking at potentially increasing our assumptions as we go into  with respect to the adoption so again a very strong statement with respect to the adoption of these flexible pricing models ill let oliver lead to any of particular business value use cases that were seeing oliver ratzesberger  teradata corp yeah wamsi i mentioned one use case where a very large semiconductor company internationally purchased teradata intelliflex in the second quarter and that is really to perform yield optimization of chip manufacturing plants and as i mentioned in my remarks before those are not the traditional use cases that teradata was chosen for right but now first of all with the underlying platform in this case intelliflex and the solid state options that we have in there and the high performance that we can deliver at that plus the new pricing options that we have that simply combine all the relevant features of teradata into a single pricing bundle it makes it so much easier for customers to choose teradata and to implement that and we are seeing that throughout our customer base that really the changes that we have implemented with the strategy already starting to take hold globally with a lot of companies and therefore new use cases are coming in wamsi mohan  bank of america merrill lynch thanks a lot appreciate the color and then steve if i could just followup really quick thanks for the new supplemental breakdown into the recurring elements here given that youre seeing increased traction across subscription base offerings why are we not seeing more of a pickup in the recurring product line in  is that just because we only had a few quarters of this model transition so  should be substantially higher stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah wamsi what youre seeing is exactly the latter part of that statement like the large q deal you have now a small portion you know thats a fiveyear deal so in q you have a portion of that coming in what were seeing if im looking behind the numbers i see product arr growing x at the end of  compared to the end of  so we definitely see that build in the product arr almost x you see bookings which on a combined basis perpetual cloud and term bookings are increasing close to  so again strong bookings coming through strong product arr coming through thats where were seeing the activity right now and as youre right â youre correct as that keeps building it keeps rolling in what im seeing in  is finishing  very strong and there being a very positive impact on that product line revenue in  with respect to that recurring piece rolling into  so yeah its the latter part were at the early stages of the arr building and the arr releasing into the income statement into the revenue line item and  will have more positive impact wamsi mohan  bank of america merrill lynch thanks steve operator our next question comes from raimo lenschow from barclays please go ahead raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc hey i have two quick ones so the first one is more a followup steve but if i look at that subscription line it went actually down sequentially so im just kind of like i know that is rolling in slower but if youre doing so much more why is that going down sequentially in subscription stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp the subscription â the revenue from it is â continues to â theres nothing unusual raimo in that line item the recurring product line in q the  million to  million on that recurring revenue line item is improving as those items roll through the perpetual side is falling off on the perpetual side but then again thats expected as these things convert to subscription am i getting right at your question on that raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc yeah yeah i mean we can take it off we can do it later steve and then the â if i stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp theres nothing unusual raimo going through those line items from what were seeing as those term or subscription transactions roll through raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc okay and then your comments around the q q do i just kind of simply read into that like if you look at your funnel and how the funnel is evolving then q is shaping up as a very very strong year its just that if you look at the deals in the pipeline they more look like q deals than in q and thats why we have kind of the messaging today is that kind of the right way to think about it stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah theres two messages there yes that latter is one of the messages and what were also seeing raimo with our movement towards the subscription type transactions were not â how is a good to say this were not kind of being held hostage at quarter end to try to get a perpetual transaction done and even in q we had two to three transactions that if they were on a perpetual basis we wouldve said okay what do we need to do to get them into the quarter but on a subscription basis says hey we want to do the right thing to maintain our margins those deals they were on subscription basis one was on a perpetual basis rolled over q got closed in the first two weeks of q im anticipating some of that happen in q to q but generally what we find to your latter point we find  as a kind of natural backstop for everybody with their budgets and the deals get completed in q were not going to sacrifice any margin on any transactions just to get it into the quarter and so thats why im saying q we might see a couple of those things those subscription deals kind of roll over the first part of q get done in the first part of q but then i expect that natural progression in q to get done â to get the transactions done in q raimo lenschow  barclays capital inc perfect very clear thank you operator our next question comes from derrick wood from cowen  company please go ahead j derrick wood  cowen  co llc right thanks a question for steve and congrats on the traction with subscription i mean as you look into second half what we typically see when theres an acceleration to ratable revenue theres actually incremental pressure on the model and it causes total revenue to kind of come down and be more pressured and thats not really the case in terms of what youre seeing in second half so can you give us quantitative or qualitative mechanics on why this accelerated shift is lifting what you had previously guided to and maybe theres some fx benefits in there i know the euro has gone up a lot maybe you can speak to fx as well stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah derrick yeah fx we saw  headwind in the first half seeing about  tailwind in the second half flat for the year but when im referring to our total revenue our entire model isnt shifting to subs its just the product revenue we have other elements â the consulting side the maintenance side that we see continuing to have reasonable growth in that second half and as a result we see that offsetting and bringing down our expectations now remember when i said earlier on our analyst day that companies typically go through this and they see a  to  decline in reported revenue in the next year those were kind of the fence posts that we set up there and what were seeing â and we made some assumptions as to what amount of new tcore that would go to subscriptions and existing customers that would go to subscriptions were not transitioning our full base of revenue to that and then when i see the amounts coming through were basically at our original expectation slightly higher but that kept me down to that lower level of that  to  versus  to  so really no significant change i had broad fence posts goalposts there to kind of set up  because there was a lot of sensitivity to our assumptions but now that we see the actual activity kind of tracking towards our assumptions a little bit better than what we had anticipated i feel comfortable bringing that range down into a tighter range of  to  without any significant changes to that model so everything that were seeing were at that  to  range i dont want you to lead into it thats saying okay if more is going to go we could be above that  range no were going to be within that  to  range and its really driven by the other part of our business thats not going to the subs model j derrick wood  cowen  co llc got it thats helpful and just a quick followup the maintenance growth of  pretty amazing given the  decline in perpetual license revenue i mean how sustainable is this does it start to really decelerate or is it more resilient stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah its pretty resilient because of the service levels that our customers expect from us were still growing their â tcore i want to make sure that this point gets out there tcore growth is still  off of our  installed base okay so theres still good growth for tcore out there yearoveryear driving that maintenance and driving the support that our customers expect from us so maintenance continues to be resilient i expect maintenance always to be in that kind of lowsingledigit growth rate even with our reported product revenue numbers because again underneath the underlying core of it tcore is growing  over the  installed base j derrick wood  cowen  co llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from bhavan suri from william blair  company please go ahead bhavan singh suri  william blair  co llc hey guys thanks for taking my question maybe the first one for oliver and then a quick followup for steve oliver as you look at the deployment options youve talked about sort of expanding use cases but when you look at your customers as deploying say an aws or azure or pure cloud as opposed to onpremise subscription on the competitive front are you seeing anyone new are you sort of seeing running into some of the newer vendors like snowflake at all and how does performance of tdc on aws compare with snowflake because weve seen the redshift numbers but id love to get your thoughts on snowflake oliver ratzesberger  teradata corp bhavan thank you thanks for the question obviously we are eagerly watching every single competitor that is out there and what theyre trying to do in reality what were seeing is while some of these competitors were to the cloud faster their performance and specifically for the use cases that our customers care the most which is high concurrency high scale high complex workloads thats where we differentiate the most and so far what we are seeing is that for all the cloudbased competitors they might have a place in small deployments for small companies but once the data volumes grow to a certain size once the complexity of the workload takes off and more importantly once the concurrency takes off meaning you have a couple of hundred users or a thousand users asking complex questions all the time this is where we are seeing a nodefornode advantage of over x with the teradata software and so far it has been universal in all these competitors and so when we look back we have been dealing with competitors obviously for many years and the difference that we see now is while some of the competitors have been earlier to a cloud or focus more on the cloud they have focused less on the performance than some competitors we have years ago and so that is something that now that we have full cloud deployment options and more importantly we have that portability that none of the other options have right so if you go to a snowflake or if you go to redshift or if you go to some of the other options out there you are locking yourself in to one particular cloud platform and our customers simply dont know where they want to be tomorrow they might be okay with one cloud platform today but theyre not quite sure if that will be the cloud platform of the future so these competitors are locked in into a single cloud platform in a single deployment option teradata with its performance advantage with its scale advantage we can deploy on azure on aws in our cloud in the datacenter on our hardware on your hardware and that makes us i think very uniquely positioned compared to some of these competitors plus when you already have workload on teradata when you shift that into whatever choice of cloud that you do theres zero rewrite involved with that whereas with all the other products that you have mentioned its a total rewrite of the analytics that you want to do and then youre stuck on this one platform out there and you have no choice to move around between different deployment options and so we see that really coming together as part of our teradata everywhere strategy and that is really derisking and unlocking a business with our customers for us bhavan singh suri  william blair  co llc all right thats helpful and then one for steve steve youve talked about subscription but id love to sort of get a sense of the split a little bit maybe if you can even just the split of the uptake between softwareonly subscriptions system subscriptions meaning im buying the whole system from teradata still onpremise subscription public cloud managed cloud so how are we seeing those play out and is most of the subscription today really still just onpremise but paying on a subscription model stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah bhavan most of its really onpremise our entire system now were seeing bhavan singh suri  william blair  co llc got it stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp  good growth again the real small numbers but if im looking at cloud im seeing strong growth in cloud arr would go x on cloud so theres good growth but the big numbers that grow is largely entire systems going to subscription but that shift is growing i mean throughout bhavan singh suri  william blair  co llc got it got it thanks for taking my questions ill get back in queue thank you operator our next question comes from philip winslow from wells fargo please go ahead philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc hey thanks guys for taking my question thanks for the color on tcore growth im wondering if you have a sense for the just the pricing environment that youre seeing out there kind of relative to the tcore growth itself and i just have one followup for steve after that stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah what i would say philip on the pricing is really look at our product gross margins that product gross margin continues to hold and it really would indicate that our pricing strategy is operating very very effectively in there and what i would say overall is to give you comfort that were not giving that tcore away that our objective for  is that average revenue that average price for tcore to be consistent with  even with performance improvements so again solid pricing across all of our offerings from a pricing strategy perspective and that product gross margin continues to perform very well philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc got it and then steve i know you gave some color as far as the arr that you expect to add in  when you think about the mix of perpetual versus call it perpetual equivalent how do you see that shifting in  it seems like youre kind of in the highs right now as far as whats shifting to subscription how do you see that turning in  stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp its interesting philip were going through that and seeing as i mentioned earlier were exactly above where we thought we would be performing were above in the americas down a little bit internationally and thats probably what weve been expected in the  and what were seeing in the funnel in  we actually see the international subscription business picking up in the second half so what im looking at modeling out in  is a little bit more â slightly more improvement on that conversion in the americas with better improvement internationally and a little bit higher â potentially higher conversion rate in  versus  at this point in time philip winslow  wells fargo securities llc got it thanks guys operator our next question comes from jesse hulsing from goldman sachs please go ahead jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc yeah thank you steve can you give us a reminder of what the conversion is to get to your perpetual equivalent im wondering how much acv or arr have you booked over the last three quarters before you convert because i think that would help us understand how the subscription revenue will transition in the second half stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah jesse our basis or how we calculate perpetual equivalent revenue is on a transactionbytransaction basis we look at what tcore they will be consuming on a subscription basis and price it out as though they bought it on a perpetual basis thats the onpremise side now to be conservative on that jesse if they are buying it on a oneyear contract basis i do not calculate out that they wouldve bought that on a perpetual basis i take the lower of the lower of the contract value on a oneyear basis or the equivalent if they would have purchased with respect to cloud we look at the softwareonly content with respect on that cloud and over their contractual period so again im not adding in anything on the hardware side saying â assuming if they were to purchase that on the hardware side the perpetual equivalent that were looking at as i said in the prepared remarks increasing in the second half of the year from the  million in the first half arr has grown  million over the last three quarters on that product arr jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc yeah okay stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp and so theres again strong growth in there were looking that product arr continue to grow  in  and in that mids for  so again very solid growth but the perpetual equivalent i want to leave you with that is again a truly equivalent one but if the contractor rental period is less than what they would have bought it for were using at the lower of did you understand that i mean am i clear on that jesse were trying to be very conservative not to just bump up a oneyear rental agreement jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc yes yes that makes sense and to followup on raimos question about subscription revenue i guess if you booked  million of arr in the first three quarters i wouldve expected that to grow quarteroverquarter in the second quarter and stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yes and jesse jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc  whats the disconnect there stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah now that weve asked it twice ill explain there was an anomaly in one of our perpetual customers that went to subscription in q that impacted that number if you look at â because seasonally seasonally we went down q to q last year and we went down q to q this year but as you said with that growing of that arr you would expect to that number in q to come up we have an anomaly and rightfully so this was a good anomaly to have but it comes down to one customer that took the upgrade rights that were baked into previously if you look at that recurring line item it says rights to upgrade subscription in cloud okay they took their software upgrade rights and went to an elas term software and by taking it there moved it out of the line items to the perpetual software and took it out of that subscription right and that was a sizable amount in q but what it does though what i want to highlight here is it does illustrate that our customers do have the choice okay we want to do the right thing for the customers even though it might adversely impact the line item which it did in this quarter but it was the right thing to do for the customer its an anomaly thats why i was trying to emphasize to raimo that theres nothing unusual from a recurring perspective in that line item but there is that anomaly in q so im glad you gave me the opportunity to straighten that one out jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc that makes sense and i also wanted to ask quickly on your sales and marketing investments obviously a pretty meaningful ramp quarteroverquarter in sga what are you â are you investing in new territories are you investing in overlays for the cloud products where are those investments going stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah the investments are going in primarily that direct customerfacing point context as vic talked about we continue to look at the opportunity to drive business value with our customers and we continue to make the investments targeted at our largest  analytical opportunities in the world and bring the right resources to bear for those customers to drive that business value so the majority of that sga increase all is in the gotomarket areas and particularly â very specifically direct customerfacing investments jesse hulsing  goldman sachs  co llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from karl keirstead from deutsche bank please go ahead karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi two for steve steve just back to your  revenue guidance i think you said that you would expect revenue growth in  i just wanted to confirm thats a little higher than i think most street analysts are modeling is that a reported revenue number that you think should go up versus  or is that some kind of equivalent or adjusted basis and secondly are you assuming positive maintenance growth in  to get there stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah karl what im basing that on is our assumptions that we are looking at right now with respect to the conversion to subscription and given those assumptions that were looking at now and looking at how that product ar is rolling through and looking at what were assuming total tcore will grow in  over the  installed base im seeing that â and im calculating that into reported product revenue number then when i look at our other segments of the business with respect to maintenance and consulting maintenance im anticipating will continue to grow lowsingledigits and consulting continuing to grow that those would offset the reported product revenue number and result in a slight increase in reported revenue in  karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc awesome thank you and then my second question is just on the share count for  steve i know its tough and im essentially asking for a little color on the timing of the buyback but modeling the full year share count is important to get to our eps number what would you anticipate if you can say what the full year average diluted share count should be sort of post that second half repurchase stephen mark scheppmann  teradata corp yeah and what im seeing is that depending upon the timing of the share repurchases that could have a favorable impact on eps maybe of  to   to  rather and its our expectation to be again very optimistic in executing that karl e keirstead  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you steve operator we will now turn the call back over to mr lund for closing remarks victor l lund  teradata corp everyone thank you for your questions and insights i think you can sense that were excited about where we are things are coming together we have still a lot of work to do any of the transformation that happens but i want you to know from an operational perspective we are  focused on growth here i look at that every day the numbers are confusing the  its even going to be more confusing next year but we are focused on growth and we are seeing that were looking at our consulting revenue we want to make sure the revenue were doing is focused to get customer accounts that we want and that when going after and that that will drive teradata software growth either directly or indirectly a lot of questions about our ga we are building a support organization but i want you to know that we are laserfocused on making sure that those investments were making get stabilized and make us a more efficient organization we have a lot of opportunity to improve the way we operate and we are working on that monitoring it closely and finding a better a quality organization thats able to function in the new environment we see so were continuously excited but were also not naÃ¯ve we have a lot of work to do here but i think we have the plan i dont think i know we have the plan to drive this forward and im monitoring it every day so again thank you for taking the time we look forward to talk to you all demonstrating our continued performance in the third quarter so thank you very much and with that well conclude the call operator this does conclude todays conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy
