for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent or in connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar circumstance investors in small companies may and frequently do lose all of their investment investing in private securities offerings requires high risk tolerance low liquidity need and longterm commitment investment in small especially startup and early stage companies is speculative and involves a high degree of risk while promised or targeted returns on the amount invested should reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment such returns may never be realized andor may not be adequate to compensate an investor for risks taken loss of an investor’s entire investment is very possible and can easily occur even the timing of any payment of a return on an investment is highly speculative among many factors to consider is that the issuers management may be inexperienced due to inexperience management may not be able to execute on its business plan an investor may not be able to evaluate the company’s operating history indeed there may be none the issuer may have serious risks specific to its industry or business model demand for a product or service may be seasonal or be impacted by the overall economy small businesses in particular often depend heavily upon a single customer supplier or upon one or a small number of employee s it may have difficulty competing against larger companies who can negotiate for better prices from suppliers produce goods and services on a large scale more economically or take advantage of bigger marketing budgets the company may not have audited financial statements or even be required to provide investors with any annual audited financial statements audited financial statements are not required for reg cf offerings under  the company is not required to provide you with annual audited financial statements or quarterly unaudited financial statements except as explained above the issuer may not even have its financial statements audited or even reviewed by outside auditors your decision to make an investment in the issuer will be based upon the information the issuer provides in its offering materials which may not completely or even accurately represent the financial condition of the company the issuer may lack adequate financial controls and procedures the issuer in all likelihood will not have an internal control infrastructure it will not have the controls you would expect to find in a publiclyheld company subject to the sarbanes oxley act of  “sarbanes oxley” because the issuer will not be subject to sarbanes oxley its financial and disclosure controls and procedures will reflect its status as a development stage nonpublic company there can be no assurance of no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of the issuer’s financial and disclosure controls and procedures indeed if it were necessary to implement such financial and disclosure controls and procedures the cost to the issuer might even have a material adverse effect on the issuer’s results of operations lack of information to monitor and value an issuer as explained above an investor may not be able to obtain the information it wants regarding a particular issuer on a timely basis or at all it is possible that the investor may not be aware of material adverse changes that have occurred at the issuer an investor may not be able to get accurate information about an issuer’s current value at any given time the issuers management may have broad discretion over how the issuer uses the net proceeds of an offering unless the company has agreed to a specific use of the proceeds from the offering the issuer’s management will usually have considerable discretion over how to use the capital raised you may not have any assurance the issuer will use the proceeds appropriately you should pay close attention to what the issuer says about how offering proceeds are to be used lack of control because the issuers founders directors and executive officers may be among its largest stockholders they may be able to exert significant control over the issuers business and affairs and may even have actual or potential interests that diverge from those of other investors this may worsen as time goes on if the holdings of the issuers directors and executive officers increase upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted in addition to holding or controlling board seats and offices these persons may well have significant influence over and control of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval separate from how the issuers other stockholders including investors may vote in a given offering completion of offering and relationship between issuer and the site investors that participate in an offering on the site should be aware that once an offering has completed and an investor has received securities from the issuer there may or may not be any ongoing relationship between the issuer and the site any questions or concerns related to
