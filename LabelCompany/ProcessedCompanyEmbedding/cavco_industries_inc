acquisition of a fleetwood factory in southern virginia is playing an increasingly important role in the company’s market strategy by manufacturing a diverse mix of manufactured and park models for a growing dealer base according to a press release before phoenix arizbased cavco acquired fleetwood’s housing division two years ago the rocky mount factory only built hudcode homes as it had since  but with the cavco acquisition the factory’s product mix now includes not only fleetwoodbrand manufactured homes but cavco’s own lines of manufactured homes as well as park models “we’re pleased with the progress we’ve been making” said tom satterwhite general manager of the rocky mount factory which employs  people “we’re happy too because the rocky mount facility gives us a strategic market reach we didn’t have before” said tim gage vice president of cavco’s specialty division noting the company now has improved access to the northeast and midatlantic states because expensive trucking costs have been eliminated in addition to manufactured housing the plant is producing several new park model lines the rocky mount factory initially produced customdesigned park model cabins for campgrounds affiliated with kampgrounds of america inc koa but now the facility builds both cabins and traditional vinyl sided park models for a growing number of independently owned and operated parks as well as koabrand campgrounds throughout the eastern us cavco said the factory is also opening up new distribution channels for park models both through street dealers and at campgrounds that want to sell the products to consumers as weekend retreats or vacation cottages “we’re constantly becoming stronger and getting more distribution and more retail turns on our product” satterwhite said the company said it is also developing growing number of sales leads through its websites and by participating in a growing number of tradeshows such as the upcoming pennsylvania rv and camping show which is scheduled sept  in hershey pa the national rv tradeshow scheduled for nov  to dec  in louisville ky along with north carolina rv shows in charlotte greensboro and raleigh for more information

park model ‘kolony’ ready april   by rvbusiness · leave a comment  interior of the first solarpowered lodge opened in may  at herkimer diamond koa in new york with more than  inches of annual precipitation and three times as many cloudy days as sunny ones upstate new york seems like the wrong place to determine the extent to which people can satisfy their energy needs with solar energy but dr renee scialdo shevat argues that it’s actually an ideal place since most of america has a similar climate and she hopes to prove it with the energy production and consumption data she collects from the nation’s first “solar kolony” which she is establishing this week at the herkimer diamond koa campground in hekimer ny according to a news release the “solar kolony” is a collection of three fully furnished “park model” cabins which will be available for rent throughout the camping season but unlike the “kamping lodges” that are available at other koa campgrounds dr shevat’s units are powered exclusively by solar panels with a backup propane generator “we’re hoping to complete the installation of our ‘solar kolony’ in time for earth day on april ” dr shevat said adding that she is already receiving reservations from consumers who want to rent the environmentally friendly units herkimer diamond koa installed its first solar powered park model cabin from phoenix arizbased cavco industries last may but the unit was so popular with campers that dr shevat decided to install two more of cavco’s solar powered park models this month thus creating the nation’s first “solar kolony” but while many consumers will be enticed by the novelty of spending the night in the nation’s first “solar kolony” dr shevat is eager to study the kolony’s energy production and consumption data which she plans to share with the new york state energy research and development authority the park models that dr shevat purchased to create the solar kolony have been equipped with energy saving lighting and appliances but no one knows at this point whether it’s more cost effective or green to use a propane generator to produce backup power to recharge the kolony’s batteries or simply to tap into new york’s existing electrical grid given the relatively low cost of electricity that’s available between midnight and  am “this will be one of many questions we hope to answer during the coming year” dr shevat said beyond this she said campers who spend the night in the “solar kolony” will also have a chance to learn about other green building and living practices the squarefoot units each of which sleep six are all unique but still have one thing in common green technologies some of the units feature bamboo flooring led lighting recycled axels and tires recycled lumber composite decking ondemand water heating energy efficient heating and airconditioning as well as a complete assortment of ecofriendly cleaning and bathroom products including coreless toilet paper that leaves no cardboard core at the end of the roll even the units’ amishstyle furniture has been manufactured from recycled milk jugs and recycled hickory wood storage tanks are also being set up to capture rainwater that falls on the units so that it can be used to irrigate an organic vegetable and herb garden park guests will be encouraged to pick vegetables and herbs from the garden during the summer months and to use them in their cooking while they stay at the park “our guests will not only have an opportunity for a great camping experience but the dwelling itself becomes an educational tool” dr shevat said adding “my hope is that our guests not only come to enjoy our park and our ‘solar kolony’ with friends and family but come away inspired to live a greener lifestyle” for more information

operated by the riverside county regional park  open space district it’s also one of a growing number of governmentrun parks investing in park models as rental accommodations “we did a feasibility study and a master plan and one of the features that was called out was cabins for folks who want to get outdoors and have a nice recreational experience but don’t have a camping unit themselves” said scott bangle general manager of park district riverside county just installed six silvercrestwestern homes division park models at rancho jurupa park and the county plans to add more park models to other county parks in the future “i could see having a handful of units at every park” bangle said “they will be part of our inventory at all of our major regional parks someday” riverside county of course isn’t the only government agency that’s investing in park models as rental units phoenix arizbased cavco industries inc just delivered  park model cabins to lassen national park in northern california and the company is in discussions with other california counties about purchasing parks models for use as rental accommodations said tim gage vice president of cavco’s specialty division “we believe that the government campground parks are a marketplace that hasn’t been fully explored at this point” said gage private parks for their part have been stepping up their investments in park model cabins in recent years but despite the significant purchases of park model cabins as rental units by kampgrounds of america inc koa leisure systems inc lsi and operators of independent parks north america’s private campground sector is still a long way from being saturated with rental accommodations in fact the koa system which purchased  park models last year is now waiving royalty fees on park model income for one year on any new units that its franchisees purchase this year “the idea is to encourage more koas to invest in lodging” said mike atkinson director of lodging for the billings montbased franchisor adding that park models are “becoming an absolute necessity to grow your campground income” necessity or not park models accounted for  of koa’s  fully equipped with bathrooms rental accommodations systemwide in  and generated over three times as much income as typical rv sites “park models have the longest shortterm occupancy and you get over three times the money” atkinson said atkinson added that most people who could be potential campground accommodations guests have not even been exposed yet to the concept of course atkinson cautions that simply purchasing park models doesn’t turn into immediate revenue hikes because they have to be marketed he says it typically takes three years for them to reach their marketing potential pinnacle park homes units in campground setting nevertheless some park operators find that these ordinarily rusticlooking units outperform their expectations scott cory managing partner of ventura ranch koa in the mountains southeast of santa barbara calif installed four cavco park models at his park in june of last year it was the first time his park offered accommodations and he found that his guests responded very favorably to his investment “lodging is the biggest ‘wow’ factor we’ve done at our park” he said adding that he plans to purchase six more park models this year he also complements his park models with glamour tents and teepees manufacturers for their part are increasingly rolling out more park model rental options not only to accommodate rising demand for rental units but to make up for recent declines in sales to consumers who traditionally purchased park models and placed them on leased campsites for use as their own private vacation cottage “we’re looking at doing more rentals because more and more campgrounds are realizing the benefits of having park models versus transient rv sites” said tyler steele vice president of canterbury rv in goshen ind “listening to the needs and desires of campground owners and then turning that input into an affordable and profitable cabin design has been a crucial key to our growth” said andy davis sales manager for pinnacle park homes in ochlocknee ga some park model manufacturers however still focus most of their attention on producing units for consumers who want to buy them for use as vacation cottages that they can place on leased or purchased campsites in campgrounds rv parks or resorts “we’re probably about  for campground rentals while  of our production is for retail sales” said john soard general manager of fairmont park trailers in nappanee ind chariot eagle cabin joe follman sales manager for chariot eagle inc in ocala fla added that park operators that rent or lease sites to park model owners can benefit from having a steady income stream “i think there’s still a lot of room to grow in this industry both in the sunbelt and up north” he said “there’s still plenty of business out there we’re such a small percentage of the rv business” a continuing roadblock is the availability of financing both for consumers and parks that want to purchase park models for use as rental accommodations “you can show how quickly they can be paid off and how it’s a great investment to put cabins in but the lenders are just not buying aggressively” said dick grymonprez of athens park homes in athens texas “if we could get financing all of us would be building more cabins i can’t tell you how many campgrounds tell me ‘if you can get us financing we’ll buy six’ i can’t tell you how many roadblocks we face getting them financed” but there is money out there parks are continuing to purchase park models and increasingly manufacturers say that the best sources are local lenders rather than nationally known lenders that have little knowledge or experience with the park model product the same approach can also help consumers find sources of financing for park models they’d like to purchase as private vacation cottages “we’re recommending that dealers work with their local banks and educate them about the lack of defaults in the park model world and why it’s a good business model for them”

inc is helping create a market for campers who don’t want to pitch a tent tow an rv or buy or rent a pricey cabin the company’s main business is making manufactured homes but it has developed a small but steadily growing niche of making recreational park trailers that can be purchased for about  and up or rented at affordable prices according to the arizona republic cavco is even producing a solar version and recently installed what it claims to be the first solarpowered parkmodel cabin that can be operated off an electrical grid at a koa campground officials with kampgrounds of america inc the world’s largest camping company credit the little units with expanding its customer base bringing in more minorities and “jumpstarting” a new camping segment that wants an affordable camping experience with some comfort “they opened up camping to an entirely new market for us there’s a level of camper out there who wants the comfort and is willing to pay for it” koa spokesman mike gast said jim rogers president and ceo of koa predicts that the commercialcampground industry will become more aggressive over the next five to  years in buying units like these the squarefoot lodges that cavco makes for koa are rented for  to  a night and come with bathrooms and fullservice kitchens and can sleep four to six people “we call it marriott camping” rogers said koa and cavco came together about eight years ago the yearold koa headquartered in billings mont had been renting smaller “kabins” and “kottages” for several decades to give customers alternatives to tents and rvs but most of those units don’t have bathrooms and kitchens koa found them to be expensive to maintain and buy and for about the past dozen years yearold cavco had been making smaller squarefoot versions of its manufactured homes as second homes they are called park models because they designed for rv parks cavco proposed the idea of making more rusticlooking park models for camping for several years the two companies tested various materials and the durability of the homes gast said of a typical cavco lodge “it looks like it belongs in a campground it either has cedar or log sides it comes in on wheels you add a porch and all of a sudden you’ve got a cabin in the woods” the company bought  last year and expects to buy an additional  this year he said the lodges have proven to be popular with customers “we can’t get enough of them fast enough” rogers said of the lodges “that’s the future of camping in the us it’s looking very good for cavco industries as a result of the popularity” the bulk of koa’s business is renting tent or rv spaces and only about  is its lodging business gast said but rentals of the kabins kottages and now lodges have been growing because they offer affordable vacations at a variety of locations “we found out last year that camping is hotter than we thought we had our best summer in  years we did a lot of surveys and it was the affordability and the desire for a quality affordable vacation close to home that really rang true to customers” gast said rogers said cavco is koa’s main supplier but it hasn’t been able to buy all its lodges from cavco because of the cost of freighting them from a plant in goodyear ariz cavco hopes to resolve that issue by starting production at a fleetwood enterprises inc plant at rocky mount va that cavco acquired last

end of this year “our current president and ceo has vast responsibilities and we may consider some realignment of duties going forward” said arvc chairman david l berg “we are looking at all staff positions and responsibilities within the organization and may restructure some positions” berg talked about staffing and other initiatives underway at arvc in an address to members of the texas association of campground owners taco who had gathered at guadalupe river rv resort in kerrville for taco’s annual spring meeting and convention their convention began sunday and ends today may  in a subsequent interview berg cautioned that no final decisions have been made about the approach arvc will take to replace profaizer who retires dec  “we want to make sure that our selection process enables us to recruit the best possible candidate for this position” he said in his address to taco members berg also said that arvc is heavily promoting the gocampingamerica website with both print and online advertising initiatives he also said arvc is continuing to take steps to improve communication with its state affiliates and that the national association hasn’t given up on the idea of having taco become an affiliate of arvc once again “we’d like to have you back in the family” he said adding “we arvc need to improve our communication and treat the states as equal partners” berg also lauded former arvc chairman jeff sims also in attendance at the meeting for his volunteer work reaching out to nonarvc member parks to educate them about the merits of arvc membership as of midmay sims had personally visited more than  parks at his own expense monday’s taco meeting also included a presentation by bob mackinnon of murrieta califbased guestreviews “texas has strong

texas association of campground owners campgrounds diversifying with rentals may   by rvbusiness · leave a comment  the campground business has been the most resilient sector of the travel and tourism business throughout the recession but it’s not just because campgrounds offer the most affordable vacation option according to the daily exchange waterloo ontario “campgrounds increasingly offer rental accommodations so they’re no longer solely dependent on tent campers and rv owners” said linda profaizer president and ceo of the national association of rv parks and campgrounds arvc adding that roughly a third of america’s campgrounds now offer park model rental accommodations but most campgrounds aren’t building their own rental accommodations from scratch in most cases they are ordering factorybuilt cabins and cottages which are being delivered to their parks just in time for the camping season many of them look like miniature log or cedarsided cabins but these squarefoot units are actually recreational park trailers or “park models” and are technically classified as recreational vehicles “they’re completely turnkey” said william garpow executive director of the recreational park trailer industry association rptia which represents park model manufacturers “all the campground owner has to do is hook each unit up to the utilities and they’re ready to rent” and perhaps best of all since “park models” are technically classified as recreational vehicles they do not require building permits in most jurisdictions so campgrounds can literally order them over the phone and have them delivered to their parks within a matter of weeks “manufacturers construct these units in factories to conform with approximately  safety requirements contained in the national safety standard for recreational park trailers” garpow said industry insiders see the campground industry’s increasing investments in park models and other rental accommodations as a shrewd business move particularly given rising fuel costs and the dramatic decline in towable and motorized rv sales in recent years as a result of the recession “to a certain extent the campground industry has insulated itself from the economic downturn by installing rental units” profaizer said indeed by providing rental accommodations campgrounds are drawing not only tenters and rvers but anyone who would normally stay in a hotel or motel while they travel “with park model cabin rentals we can appeal to families who don’t have to worry about going out and purchasing an rv or having a tow vehicle or whatever the case may be they can just get in their car and come to one of our parks” said rob schutter coo of milford ohiobased leisure systems inc which franchises jellystone park campresorts campgrounds have been gradually investing in park model cabins and other rental accommodations for many years but the focus on rentals has intensified in recent years in fact the competition for campground business has become so fierce that park model manufacturers are facing increasing competition from rv manufacturers who are now marketing some of their own products as rental accommodations for campgrounds for more than  years in fact the breckenridge division of damon corp in nappanee ind was the only thor industries inc subsidiary that produced rental accommodations for campgrounds now there are four thor subsidiaries vying for a piece of the campground rental business with topeka indbased crossroads rv goshen indbased keystone rv co and jackson center ohiobased airstream inc each competing for a piece of the campground accommodations business along with breckenridge some of the major campground chains for their part are busy working out exclusive arrangements with leading park model manufacturers which are building customdesigned rental units for their parks phoenix arizbased cavco industries inc for example is building units for kampgrounds of america inc koa while crossroads rv recently landed an agreement to build custom designed park models for yogi bear’s jellystone park campresorts another rv resort developer memphis tennbased rvc outdoor destinations is working with athens park homes in athens texas to furnish its resorts with park models but while some see the growing demand for rental units in campgrounds as a result of rising fuel costs and declining rv sales it also reflects significant sociological changes taking place across the united states profaizer said “families are increasingly time deprived and the dynamics of the summer vacation have changed” she said “people are camping closer to home because they don’t have as much time off to take extended trips across the country oftentimes both parents are working and their kids are often involved in extracurricular activities which limit their ability to travel” in addition she said many families are finding that it’s easier and more convenient to rent a cabin for a weekend getaway than to spend their limited free time packing setting up and taking down tent camping equipment for others she said having a cabin rental gives them an opportunity to experience camping in the great outdoors even if they don’t have an rv schutter of leisure systems said campgrounds are also finding that park model rentals are particularly appealing to women especially mothers “in our particular system” he said “one of the major decision makers is mom and mom finds all the comforts of home in these units that’s a big selling point” thomas heneghan ceo of equity lifestyle properties inc also said park model accommodations have wide market appeal “in today’s economy” he said “the park model extends the outstanding value and experience of the outdoor lifestyle to families who are either unfamiliar with tent camping or rving or who prefer the conveniences offered by staying in a park model” he added that park models “allow one to have all of the comforts and conveniences of home with the ability to have a change of scenery and reconnect with family” park model manufacturers for their part find it behooves them to pay attention to campgrounds and their growing accommodations needs “many of our manufacturers are literally racing to get these units in place in time for the summer camping season” said garpow of rptia adding that the presummer rush can be a nailbiter for campgrounds many of which have already booked the park models they have ordered for this summer such is the case at west glacier koa in glacier mont which just received six park model cabins in late april “we’re hooking them up to septic and electric utilities right now” said park coowner theresa mcclure adding that five of the six units are already booked may  when the park opens for the summer camping season “it’s just crazy” mcclure said of consumer demand for park model cabins which koa markets as kamping lodges “we could probably put in  and they’d all be booked” filed

the nation’s first park trailer to achieve “emerald” status from nta inc a nappaneebased company that specializes in certifying “green” manufacturers phoenix arizbased cavco industries inc received the emerald status for the herkimer park trailer in late april after proving that the unit met nta’s highest green standards indeed the herkimer koa unit believed the first “offgrid” park trailer in the country features numerous green features including solar panels capable of producing   kilowatts of power bamboo flooring led lighting recycled axels and tires recycled lumber composite decking ondemand water heating energy efficient heating and airconditioning but while this unit may demonstrate one company’s efforts to prove how green it can be in reality park trailer manufacturers in elkhart county ind and across the country are increasingly seeking green certifications not only for their products but for their manufacturing processes and several consulting engineering firms are helping them obtain their green certifications in the past year tr arnold  associates in elkhart has certified elkhartbased trophy homes inc and forest river inc as well as middleburybased woodland park as green manufacturers while athens texasbased athens park homes also met nta’s requirements for green certification elkhartbased country log cottages for its part has also obtained green certification from anderson indbased bis llc as has chariot eagle inc an ocala flabased park trailer manufacturer olin wenrick president and ceo of trophy homes said consumers are becoming increasingly educated about the merits of green products and it may eventually get to the point where manufacturers are at a disadvantage if they aren’t able to tell their customers they are green “it’s coming so why not start now” wenrick asked “it at least tells people out there that i’m trying to do the right thing for the environment” in trophy’s case it already was trophy had already adopted environmentally friendly manufacturing practices such as recycling its construction waste so it was relatively easy for the company to get green certified wenrick said dave burrows national sales manager for middleburybased woodland park said his company also achieved green certification with relative ease “we didn’t really have to change anything” he said “we had been manufacturing to green standards for quite a while there was just not a certification process or a verification process for our industry” but tr arnold  associates nta bis and other consulting firms have tried to fill that void and park trailer manufacturers are finding it’s worth their time and effort to seek green certifications burrows in fact said woodland park’s dealers applauded its green certification “basically the dealers looked at it as a move in the right direction they looked at it as another tool for them to sell our product and my canadian dealers absolutely loved the thought of a green product” mandy leazenby tr arnold  associates’ green program manager said her company looks at several criteria before determining whether a company’s manufacturing operations can be green certified “we look at indoor airquality resource efficiency energy efficiency water efficiency operations and maintenance and innovative practices” she said “we also look at the attitude of the company and the extent to which they recycle materials during the construction process” but while obtaining “green” certification has been relatively painless for several elkhart county manufacturers to achieve selling “green” units is another matter said wenrick adding that his company’s green status hasn’t yet translated into increased sales that day may come however in fact while many consumers may not yet be ready to purchase an “off grid” green park trailer with all the bells and whistles such as solar panels with backup generators consumers are showing interest in purchasing park trailers with energy and water saving features such as led lighting low flow faucet and showerheads and energy saving appliances dick grymonprez vice president of marketing for athens park homes which achieved its green certification last year said his company is seeing increased demand for instant hot water heaters “some people just focus on solar panels but there are different shades of green” said leazenby of tr arnold  associates adding that there are many green features in today’s park trailers that are very positive features for consumers such as units with lowvoc paints and finishes as well as

in the western united states and mesabased rv traders has consistently been its largest dealer a distinction that recently prompted cavco to name rv traders its “dealer of the decade” but while rv traders coowners ken dugwyler and jack crays are obviously pleased with cavco’s recognition they are equally enthused about the timing of cavco’s announcement which coincides with a sharp upturn in consumer demand for park models after two years of lagging sales according to a news release “the park models really seem to be reviving this year” dugwyler said adding that rv traders’ sales are up  over  figures rv traders which has locations in mesa and apache junction sells both park models as well as travel trailers fifthwheels and toy haulers but dugwyler said park models which are used as seasonal cottages in rv parks and resorts in arizona and throughout the sunbelt have withstood the economic downturn better than towable rvs and consequently have helped his dealership weather the recession “the demand for everything declined in the past couple of years but the regular rvs suffered considerably more than the park models” dugwyler said adding “we’re definitely doing a lot better with park model sales this year than the past couple of seasons especially last year our rv business is improving as well” rv traders has been involved in the park model business in arizona since its inception in the late s dugwyler said demand for park models has grown in arizona and across the sunbelt because park models offer snow birds an attractive roomy and sturdy alternative to travel trailers fifthwheels and motorhomes unlike towable or motorized rvs park models are square foot cottagelike units with full size kitchen appliances showers and interior furnishings park models are also better insulated than towable or motorized rvs which makes them more comfortable for use as a seasonal dwelling “park models are technically classified as recreational vehicles but they are sort of a hybrid between a factorybuilt home and an rv” dugwyler said “they are approved by zoning laws to go into rv parks but they are built more like a small home” and while rv traders initially sold park models almost exclusively to snow birds cavco’s decision to broaden its product offering to include cabinstyle park models has helped open up a new market for working professionals families and retirees who want to have a weekend or seasonal getaway cabin in the mountains of northern arizona the rockies and the pacific northwest “our geographic reach is growing every year” dugwyler said “we’re shipping units to california oregon washington and colorado we’ve even sold some units in montana and wyoming” and because rv traders is also a fullservice rv dealership it can accept towable rvs and motorhomes as tradeins for park model units “we resell just about every park model we take in trade for a new one” dugwyler said adding that older park models are typically sold for use in some of the more economical rv parks cavco for its part is pleased that rv traders continues to enjoy market success “they’ve been our number one dealer for sales and customer service ever since we signed them on” said tim gage vice president of cavco’s specialty group adding “we fully expect that rv traders will continue to grow with us in the years ahead” filed under breaking newstagged cavco

park model companies do” the units include tongue and grove interiors specialty floor materials and composite siding the walls are glued together instead of nailed together and the dormers in the
