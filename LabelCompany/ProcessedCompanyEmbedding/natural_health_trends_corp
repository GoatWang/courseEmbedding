investingsummarydespite generating less income for q  due to a delay in distributors recruiting business fundamentals remain strongvaluation metrics indicate that the firm is on sales at a significant bargainthe prudent course of action is to initiate small purchases while awaiting the upcoming quarter resultsbackground similar to notable companies operating in the wellness products market natural health trends nasdaqnhtc suffered substantial share price depreciation in  due to activist investors’ campaigns and regulatory difficulties as chinese authorities probed the firm’s alleged multilevel marketing “mlm” practice the stock tumbled from its  peak on nov   to  by jan  a year ago source stockcharts retouched by dr tran biosci in the triumphant note for shareholders natural health trends has been vigorously defending against all claims and thus brought the stock back to  as of late activism asides the firm is posting robust yearly earnings growth and yet its valuation metrics are highly favorable about natural health trends headquartered in los angeles california natural health trends corp commenced operation with the launch of the intimacy enhancement cream alura over the years the firm expanded its portfolio and now engages in the direct selling and ecommerce of beauty home baby herbal wellness and lifestyle products in  different countries as of march   there are  active members namely those who purchased at least  item in the preceding year despite having a global presence the firm generated over  of all sales from hong kong members who distributed the goods to customers in china which is the company’s most promising market source natural health trends retouched by dr tran biosci strong operating metrics for half a decade revenues have increased by leaps and bounds  from m in  to m in  accordingly natural health trends strong results stemmed from its stellar management particularly christopher sharng who has an indepth understanding of the asian ecommerce market as the fruits of its sound business are realized in the form of ample cash flow the company started to pay  dividend in  and increased it to  by  thereafter three special dividends   and  were paid source dr tran biosci furthermore the directors authorized the increase in share repurchase from m in july   to m by jan  last year notably m worth of stocks were bought in the open market as of march   while m remains for future accumulation with strong fundamentals and increasing buybacks it is not far from the truth that the stock will continue to trade northbound over time despite stellar developments q  report showed a  sales decline compared to the same period a year prior m down from m  as follows the company stated that the decrease was due to the mistiming of their ambassador academy an event held annually in january but delayed to march this year even with  sales decline in china as a result of the m reduction in the home product line the firm was able to increase revenues by  and  for north america and europe respectively source natural health trends retouched by dr tran biosci financials and valuations as mentioned natural health trends has been posting increasing revenues and income trends for the past five years accordingly sales aggressively grew by  moreover the firm reaped  net earnings increase from m to m for the same period furthermore there is a slight sales reduction for the past months m versus m in  which was due to the new distributors recruitment delay nevertheless we expect sales to regain their growth trajectory as efforts to enlist new members to normalize source dr tran biosci that aside the balance sheet is strong with no longterm debts while there are only m in shortterm borrowings for  in addition cash and equivalent stand at m additionally operating cash flows and ebitda are m and m correspondingly with the market capitalization of m natural health trends is an uber bargain by trading at only x cash and x earnings using the product of  pe average of peers with m net income the company should be worth at least m based on our arithmetics this investment has  upsides calculated from m true value divided by m market cap source finbox retouched by dr tran biosci management according to the father of growth investing philip fisher “the company with real investment merit usually promotes from within” in contrast “of one thing the investor can be certain a larger companys need to bring in a new chief executive from the outside is a damning sign of something basically wrong with the existing management” that being said natural health trends corp leverages on internal talent by promoting christopher sharng to president in  from his former position as cfo and evp as a columbia university mba graduate mr sharng also held management positions at northpole limited as cfo ultrak inc as svpcfo and mattel as vp of international finance likewise the company rewarded the former chief accounting officer scott davidson with the title svpcfo in  having been with the firm for an extended period the senior management has an indepth knowledge of the ins and outs of its operations to ensure success and this wisdom is manifested as their ability to deliver the strong records of earnings increase year after year potential risks the main investing risk in natural health trends is the potential loss of its strategic base china there are strong competitors operating in this market including usana health sciences nyseusna nu skin enterprises nysenus and herbalife nysehlf nonetheless the asian markets are vast and have highly receptive populations which ensure ample room for various competing firms to grow that aside the other risks are activist investor campaigns and shareholder lawsuits which can incur additional costs as well as lower shortterm share price of note the stock tumbled on jan  when two security class actions were initiated against the firm the complaint was regarding its alleged mlm operation in china in response the company filed a motion to dismiss all complaints however the court denied it in all the management believes that these claims were without merits and is determined to vigorously defend against them it is imperative for readers to note that mlm is illegal in china natural health trends bypasses this issue by employing distributors in hong kong who then sell the products directly to customers in china and despite the aforementioned concerns the firm has been able to generate an overall sales and earnings increase furthermore shortterm share price depreciations have been opportunistic purchases that handsomely rewarded the intelligent investors conclusion amidst the difficulties of investor activism and mlm legality surrounding natural health trends lies the opportunity to accumulate shares in the said highly aggressive grower the company procured impressive earning results for the past five years valuation metrics are also highly favorable even with the uncertainty in the upcoming quarters operating results the margin of safety is certainly widened to warrant consideration by value and growth investors of note it is prudent to accumulate shares in the stepwise fashion in waiting for more earnings data to come as warren buffett said that one should not test the water with both feet in addition shares price has been gyrating wildly in both extremes due to the small float only m shares are available for trading hence the company is not suited for investors who cannot stomach high trading volatility beta as the professionals call it as the final icing on this cake the remainder of the m for share buyback is another incentive for stock appreciation to reward loyal shareholders
