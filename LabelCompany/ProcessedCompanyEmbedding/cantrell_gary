gary cantrell  jabil  insightive it leadershipgary cantrell speaks about digital innovation at jabil january   by insightivetv“iot is one of those areas where i think there is a lot of hype but i also think there is a lot of opportunities we need to figure out where there is value for our customers i think it is in a great place not only to find solutions for that but to provide ideas for the business about how we can go develop these opportunities into new business models” insightivetv do you think it is seen as an enabler or necessary cost — has there has been a change in this perspective recently gary over the last few years i think the perspective has rapidly changed from cost to key enabler jabil has definitely undergone this transition my boss our coo has developed an insatiable appetite for the transformation power the it team can bring the goal has really become to take a broad and strategic approachthe development and availability of technology has had an impact but as much as anything else i think the change has come from an attitude shift within the it team itself we made a purposeful pivot to look at the new technologies and work with the business to figure out how to best leverage those technologies in innovative ways it was the combination of realising the opportunities in the digital space and opening up a dialogue with the business leaders that has allowed us to have success this has created a much more value based and strategic set of priorities than existed even a few years ago insightivetv what are some of the recent developments you have been working on gary one large project involved working with our supply chain leaders to develop an intelligent digital supply chain we have also done quite a bit around analytics within the production line and within our production facilitieswe started working to implement digital analytics about two years ago — beginning with some specific tools like microsoft azure we implemented these technologies within the product line to analyse how to improve our product quality this also enabled us to run algorithms on production parts to predict failures before they showed up in the inspection processes we can then look at all this information and improve some of our other operations things like machine maintenance operate on prescribed cycles which frankly may or may not be optimal for what we are doing so we are using analytics to improve those processes and we are seeing some early successto help cultivate the skills needed to engage in a digital culture we recently started our citizen data scientist program this is a training program that takes internal subject matter experts through a curriculum on how to use analytical tools insightivetv if you look to the future what are your plans in terms of transformation — what are your dream transformation projects gary in our digital program we have three guiding principles first our digital efforts need to improve our customer experience second we must focus on improving our operations the third element is about using digital strategies to identify new business opportunities looking forward it is that third aspect where i want to see it get even more aggressive with our business partners in identifying and developing opportunities that can take technology and transform our business from a digital standpointiot is one of those areas where i think there is a lot of hype but i also think there is a lot of opportunities we need to figure out where there is value for our customers i think it is in a great place not only to find solutions for that but to provide ideas for the business about how we can go develop these opportunities into new business modelsthat is my longterm view but this is challenging we have to get the mindset right within the it organisation to take that step of being business people — as opposed to just it people this creates a second challenge  —  developing business models requires a different skill set than we have had historically we have had to go on a fairly aggressive talent development process over the last few years to bring in some of the new talents that have helped us make that transitionthe other important piece of context that has to be taken into account during implementation is that we have to continue to take care of our operations while undertaking transformation projects we are working very quickly on transforming to cloud infrastructure that will allow us to reskill part of our it force to start thinking about where we can provide new business opportunities away from what we do on the operations side that is where i get excited insightivetv in terms of the workforce are you doing anything to increase manufacturing and production productivity gary in the physical manufacturing of the products there are a number of initiatives we have where we are partnering with the operations teams you get a lot of dialogue about itot jabil is probably right in the middle of that pack in regards to having a lot of it and ot over the last eighteen months we have made some really good strides partnering with the operational teams to make both technical and strategic improvements to the shop floorpart of that is a new mes systems that we are rolling out this gives us better visibility and flexibility to tailor that system to what is needed there has been a lot of work done around analytics and visibility on the shop floor which is helping drive productivity we have had a lot of success using analytics to improve the quality of our products and to catch early defects as items go through the assembly linewe are able to look at a lot of this information in real time it varies a little by site but what we are focusing on right now is taking the analytics work from the shop floor and figuring out where we can increase value insightivetv how do your transformation projects link into the supply chain — how big of a role do you see there in the future gary we partner with our global supply chain and work a lot with them on their enablement this relationship has actually kind of turned a corner in the last eight or nine months to where the supply chain partners are now asking us to take a look at the embedded capabilities in the systems we have and work with them on identifying opportunities to improve their processes from that perspective we work with them pretty tightly and i only see that improving in the futurewe have to convince our it guys to spend more time down on the shop floor and with the supply chain leaders themselves we have to understand these processes to be able to improve the capabilities and tools this again is a challenge when we ask our guys to do this on top of their day jobhistorically it has been a little bit of a response organisation versus an organisation that pushes its ideas and advertises opportunities moving away from this is the big shift we are undertaking in all areas of the business i see this developing in the future — it is the key to adding value for further information please download trends vs technology a research report from capita
