company” until we have more operations and have substantial revenues and assets we anticipate that if we receive  from this offering we should have enough money to expand our business of kalabases production that will be sufficient to cause us to not be considered as a “shell company” we cannot provide any guarantee or assurance however that in the event we raise  from this offering we will have enough money to engage in profitable operations during the time that we are a “shell company” holders of our restricted securities will not be able to rely on rule  in connection with the sale of

if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks associated to our business we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future we were incorporated on july   and till current time we have commenced limited business operations such as formed the company developed our business plan set up our web site and leased and office space and we have purchased our d milling machine and raw materials we are newly created company potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any substantial revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely be harmed                we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from jose galarza our sole officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr galarza has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company his agreement to loan funds to kalmin corp is verbal and this verbal commitment is filed as exhibit to this registration statement after one year we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations as of august   we have yet to earn revenue and our ability to start and sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise financing our independent registered public accountant has expressed a doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations in production of kalabas cups further the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth these factors raise a doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern gbh cpas pc our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed a doubt about our ability to start and continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise in case if our sole officer and director mr galarza is not able to loan to the company needed amount of funds and in case if the company is not generating sufficient amount of  from selling kalabases we will not be able to complete our business plan as a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment in kalmin corp is suitable we are dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to develop our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve significant revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available as of august   we do not have any income and just recently starting our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve sufficient revenues and profitable operations we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us                we face competition from larger and well established companies which could harm our business and ability to operate profitably our work area is extensive there are many different concepts of kalabases production in paraguay and our services are not a lot unique to their services even though the industry is fragmented it has a number of wellestablished companies such as industrias acha sacif alberto calatrava san isidro and others which are profitable and have developed a brand name marketing tactics implemented by our competitors could impact our limited financial resources and adversely affect our ability to compete in our market because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend operations or our business will be harmed due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we have limited marketing activities and may not be able to make our products known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably our operations will be harmed because we will import our raw materials from overseas a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors we will import our equipment and some of raw materials from overseas because we plan to purchase our raw materials from abroad and ship them to our locations in paraguay we believe that disruptions in import shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who manufacture andor warehouse products in the place of location deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as        raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest        problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping container shortages        increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments and        economic crises international disputes and wars also if there are any issues regarding shipping raw materials or equipment from overseas we consider an option of purchasing raw materials for our production from americans or european  suppliers which could cause price increases it may impact out financial part and we will spend more funds on buying local raw materials and as a result we might need additional financing                problems with product quality or product performance including defects in the products we distribute could result in a decrease in customers and revenue unexpected expenses and loss of market share for our company because we are sourcing our raw materials from overseas we may encounter issues with product quality and consistency if we deliver products with errors or defects or if there is a perception that our products contain errors or defects our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed the possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective product because our sole officer and director will own substantial part of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr galarza our sole officer and director will own substantial part of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr galarza may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders because company’s headquarter and assets are located outside the united states us investors may experience difficulties in attempting to effect service of process and to enforce judgments based upon us federal securities laws against the company and its nonus resident officer and director while we are organized under the laws of state of nevada our officer and director is nonus resident also our headquarters together with assets are located outside the united states consequently it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process on them in the united states and to enforce in the united states judgments obtained in united states courts against his based on the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws  since all our assets will be located outside us it may be difficult for us investors to collect a judgment against us as well any judgment obtained in the united states against us may be enforceable in the united states if mr galarza our president and director resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer that could result in our operations suspending if that should occur you could lose your investment we extremely depend on the services of our president and director jose galarza for the future success of our business the loss of the services of mr galarza could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if he should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer if that should occur until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer our operations could be suspended in that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment                having only one director limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control of our president over operations and business decisions we have only one director who is our principal executive officer accordingly we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit issues in addition a tie vote of board members is decided in favor of the chairman which gives his significant control over all corporate issues including all major decisions on operations and corporate matters such as approving business combinations until we have a larger board of directors that would include some independent members if ever there will be limited oversight of our president’s decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to •         have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act •         provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting •         comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis •         submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and •         disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive’s compensation to median employee compensation in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company we may still be in certain circumstances subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company for example smaller reporting companies like emerging growth companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under item b of regulation sk or auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting                until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile risks associated with this offering since there is no minimum for our offering if only a few persons purchase shares they will lose their money immediately without us being even able to develop a market for our shares since there is no minimum with respect to the number of shares to be sold directly by the company in its offering if only a few shares are sold we will be unable to even attempt to create a public market of any kind for our shares in such an event it is highly likely that the entire investment of the early and only share purchasers would be lost immediately you may not revoke your subscription agreement once it is accepted by the company or receive a refund of any funds advanced in connection with your accepted subscription agreement and as a result you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock once your subscription agreement is accepted by the company you may not revoke the agreement or request a refund of any monies paid in connection with the subscription agreement even if you subsequently learn information about the company that you consider to be materially unfavorable the company reserves the right to begin using the proceeds from this offering as soon as the funds have been received and will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering the precise amounts and timing of the companys use of the net proceeds will depend upon market conditions and the availability of other funds among other factors additionally you may be unable to sell your shares of our common stock at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price you paid for such shares and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our president mr galarza does not have any prior experience offrering and selling securities and our offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment                mr galarza does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us because the company has arbitrarily set the offering price you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the company’s shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value additionally as the company was formed on july   and has no operating history and no revenues as of august   the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock to the date of this filing november   our company kalmin corp has generated limited revenues of  from selling our kalabases and bombillas to our first customer tienda calabaza mate the sales contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration statement we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in selling at least  of the shares and we receive the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering any additional funding we arrange through the sale of our common stock in the future will result in dilution to purchasers of securities in this offering we are a development stage company and have generated no revenue as of august   long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion we do not currently have planned our expansion and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing our most likely sources of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock and through selling our kalabases the stock issuances will cause interests of purchasers of securities in this offering to be diluted such dilution will negatively affect the value of investors’ shares                the trading in our shares will be regulated by the securities and exchange commission rule g   which established the definition of a “penny stock” the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the over the counter bulletin board “otcbb” the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between kalmin corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment                we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without significant revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all the estimated cost of this registration statement is  we will have to utilize funds from jose galarza our sole officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board we may be exposed to potential risks and significant expenses resulting from the requirements under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  we will be required pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we expect to incur significant continuing costs including accounting fees and staffing costs in order to maintain compliance with the internal control requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of  development of our business will necessitate on going changes to our internal control systems processes and information systems if our business develops and grows our current design for internal control over financial reporting will not be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period or on an ongoing basis accordingly as we develop our business such development and growth will necessitate changes to our internal control systems processes and information systems all of which will require additional costs and expenses in the future if we fail to complete the annual section  evaluation in a timely manner we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls in addition any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations however as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  of the sarbanes oxley act of  until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating                united states state securities laws may limit secondary trading which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell the shares offered by this prospectus there is no public market for our securities and there can be no assurance that any public market will develop in the foreseeable future secondary trading in securities sold in this offering will not be possible in any state in the us unless and until the common shares are qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals is available for secondary trading in such state there can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying our securities for secondary trading or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our securities in every state if we fail to register or qualify or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of the securities in any particular state the securities could not be offered or sold to or purchased by a resident of that state  in the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our securities the market for our securities could be adversely affected because we are a “shell company” the holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on rule  until we cease being a “shell company” we are a “shell company” as the applicable federal securities law defines that term specifically because of the nature and amount of our assets our limited operations history and limited revenues pursuant to applicable federal rules we are considered a “shell company” applicable provisions of rule  specify that during that time that we are a “shell company” holders of our restricted securities cannot sell those securities in reliance on rule  another implication of us being a “shell company” is that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan for us to cease being a “shell company” we must have more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents forward looking statements this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify such forward looking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus                      use of proceeds our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten and “bestefforts” basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of    and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no assurance that we will raise the full  as anticipated   gross

obligations jose galarza our director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process the above figures represent only estimated costs if necessary jose galarza our president and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process also these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the overthecounter bulletin board mr galarza will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by mr galarza mr galarza will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation                to the date of this filing november   our company kalmin corp has generated limited revenues of  from selling our kalabases and bombillas to our first customer tienda calabaza mate the sales contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration statement determination of offering price we have determined the offering price of the shares arbitrarily the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly higher than the price paid by the company’s officer for common equity since the company’s inception on july   jose galarza the company’s sole officer and director paid  per share for the  shares of common stock he purchased from the company on august   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders the following sections compare the differences between our future investor’s investment in our shares and the investment of our existing stockholders as of august   the net tangible book value of our shares of

includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties you should review the “risk factors” section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to •         have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act •         provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting •         comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis •         submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and •         disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo’s compensation to median employee compensation in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company we may still be in certain circumstances subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company for example smaller reporting companies like emerging growth companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under item b of regulation sk or auditor attestation of internal controls over

on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is a doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have generated no revenues as of august   to the date of this filing november

funds for business operations in the next year and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money plan of operation we intend to commence operations in the business of kalabas cups production

marketing efforts during the first year which depend on the amount of sold shares marketing is an ongoing matter that will continue during the life of our operations if we do not raise at least  in
