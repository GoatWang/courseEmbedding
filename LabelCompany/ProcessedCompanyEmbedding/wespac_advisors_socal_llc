saw as the new market reality – the boom and bust cycle from  the world had changed and wespac felt that investment management had to change to continue to generate the returns and safety that our clients expected since we developed our new approach we were tested with yet another boom cycle from  the bust cycle in  and now another boom cycle from  through today our returns for our clients demonstrate the success of our new approach across some violent markets the environment after the  crisis has continued to change the link between economic and earnings fundamentals and the markets has become stretched central banks around the globe are shamelessly targeting asset prices with monetary policy corporations are indulging in financial engineering and stock buybacks clouding earnings performance the markets are buffeted daily by the micro boom and bust cycles caused by high frequency trading the environment is getting even more challenging the uncertainty and volatility of the markets over the past  years calls into question conventional investment management most investment management strategies are based on predictions of the future and speculation about how securities will behave in that context wespac advisors believes that a more flexible and adaptive processes is required to safely deliver market beating returns in this environment     market updates wespac

our approach  wespac advisors llc skip to main content home market outlook our approach investment solutions contact you are herehomeour approach our approach our strategy wespac advisors has developed a sophisticated systematic approach to implementing tactical asset allocation across asset classes and across investment horizons this approach helps us identify market leadership to keep our portfolios allocated to the right asset classes and the right securities at the right time we participate in asset classes that are leading the market and when safe assets lead we tactically shift our allocations to that new leadership the wespac approach is not a process based on academic research predictions and speculation – it is a disciplined process that has been deployed across all types of market environments tactical asset allocation most investment management strategies are based on predictions of the future and speculation about how securities will behave in that context given the difference in performance between the leaders and the laggards across all markets there are substantial risks in holding the wrong positions at the wrong time tactical asset allocation helps you participate in what the markets are actually doing as opposed to what someone thought the markets should do when applied across asset classes and investment horizons tactical asset allocation can deliver the best of what all markets have to offer if you are uncomfortable with the performance of your investments and you feel there should be a real alternative to conventional portfolio management that is good thinking relativestrength investing relativestrength investing is a sophisticated systematic approach to implementing tactical asset allocation and active management the technology behind relative strength investing helps us identify market leadership across asset classes and investment horizons to keep you allocated to the right asset classes and securities at the right time including safe assets in times of market distress if you thought your investment solution should be more transparent flexible and adaptive to today’s market reality that is good thinking
