wecast include a thirdtier chinese publication the other company sells scooters and furniture though wecast actually calls it a leading global supply chain managerthe chairman in control of the company is a chinese entertainment guru whose former company trades otc markets under a warning note at a price of  per shareinstitutions avoid wecast stock while losses persist cash dwindles the deficit exceeds  million and wecast struggles along under going concern issues wecast network nasdaqwcst has struggled along since  when the company was called gallery rodeo international a beverly hills art business turned hotelgaming business with  in cash after seven incarnations over the decades wecast is now a mishmash of chinalinked businesses controlled by chinese parties and overseen by a chinese chairman toting  of the companys common stock meanwhile the company rips through millions of dollars subtly pushing average stockholders closer to watching their shares get watered down in the future formerly called you on demand holdings the videoondemand provider operates primarily in china after numerous business changes wecast now hopes to develop a consumer management platform for businesses and consumers  or maybe headsets  or whatever idea strikes their fancy tomorrow here is an executive summary on this company controversial underwriter chardan capital markets helped take this company public through a reverse merger into a shell company… a less than auspicious introduction to the public the stock has surged on two silly announcements of merger agreements … with companies owned by none other than wecasts chinese chairman one bogus merger is actually a million loan loaded with conditions including a profit target if sun video were actually able to reach that  million target profit level you sure couldnt buy it for so relatively little the other bogus merger is a freebie thrown in by the chairman arguably just for the sake of hype the chairmans companies offloaded to wecast include a thirdtier chinese publication the other company sells scooters and furniture though wecast has the nerve to tout it as a leading global supply chain manager the chairman who controls the company is a chinese entertainment guru who has helped grind his former company into the ground the otc markets where that stock is traded lists his nextmart under warning at a price of  per share wecasts recent announcement sounds like pure promotion designed to drive up the stock wecast suddenly wants investors to believe that its really a tech company  rather than a struggling video provider that just bought a scooter company company leaders are fleeing both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have suddenly resigned within weeks of each other institutions avoid wecast stock no surprise company revenue is slim losses are high cash is low the deficit exceeds  million and wecast drags along under going concern issues wecast is more a tiny scooterandfurniture maker than a global supply chain manager or videoondemand provider … or a headset maker this company cant decide on or focus on a business investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here meanwhile thestreetsweeper presents the top nine reasons we believe wecast is a huge risk   rats nest of related party deals the stock ran up following two mergers with companies owned by wecasts chairman merger  wecast announced the feb  completion of a merger with sun video group to buy  of my products the company name was changed from you on demand to wecast network inc the cost  million shares of wecast stock actually a  million loan the hype sun says it will generate  million profit within  months of closing or return the shares the hitch my products is owned by sun video sun is owned by chairman bruno wu this debt deal is off if sun video doesnt reach its target if sun video were really able to reach  million profit in a year no one would be able to buy it for a mere  million the deal sounds fishy to us merger  wecast on feb  acquires  of wide angle group limited the hype wide angle is an industrialtrade media and commerce company wecast gets the wide angle shares from bt capital global limited which is owned by guess who chairman bruno wu and his sun seven stars the cost nothing wcst will pay no additional monetary or stock consideration for the acquisition the hitch wecasts chairman threw in his company wide angle for free why on earth would he do that it could be that wide angle is worthless it could be the chairman wants to promote the stock or maybe both  whos your daddy and you say hes selling scooters lets look at the two companies owned by the chairman which are intricately bound to wecast first wide angle is just a thirdtier politically oriented magazine  published in china sourcehttpguangjiaojingzazhicom second my products is  owned by sun video an affiliate of mr wu and sun seven stars my products claims on its website that its a leading company of wecast global supply chain management the company further asserts it helps chinese manufacturers that export products to the us mighty big claims source pr newswire company but wayback machine shows my products is a different kind of critter yep the my products website just last october clearly states they manufacture lots of goods under various brand names source wayback machine and rather than supply chain management my products has been making and selling  scooters and furniture thats right the scooters are marketed to kids in the us denmark and china rockboard currently lists my products as its mailing address source web archive my products the above looks like a hobby website to us below is more verification of what my products really does source bizstanding business directory indeed my products was incorporated nine years ago the scooterfurniture company shares a warehouse with three other businesses in franklin indiana at  n forsythe street hmmm so scooters and furniture fall well short of global supply chain management  adios suckers its always disconcerting when officers throw up their hands and leave a company especially when the dearly departed is the chief financial officer who undoubtedly knows the company finances better than anyone and such a departure is an even bigger red flag when the cfo ducks out after less than a year on the job thats the case with wecast cfo mei chen suddenly said zài or goodbye a couple of weeks ago just about nine months after accepting the job item  departure of directors or certain officers election of directors appointment of certain officers compensatory arrangements of certain officers on january   ms mei chen the chief financial officer cfo of the company notified the board of directors the board of her resignation from her position as cfo effective february   ms chens resignation was not because of any disagreement with the company known to an executive officer of the company on any matter relating to the companys operations policies or practices the company thanks ms chen for her service to the company on january   the board appointed mr yi xu as the chief operating officer as well as the interim cfo and principal accounting officer of the company effective february   unfortunately no one less than the ceo mingcheng tao initiated the leadership dash from wecast he suddenly resigned in december item  departure of directors or certain officers election of directors appointment of certain officers compensatory arrangements of certain officers mingcheng tao resignation on december   mr mingcheng tao the chief executive officer and director of the board of directors of the company the board of wecast network inc the company notified the board of his resignation from his position as ceo and from the board effective immediately mr taos resignation was not because of any disagreement with the company known to an executive officer of the company on any matter relating to the companys operations policies or practices the company thanks mr tao for his service to the company its bad news when the top leaders flee and especially worrisome with these little chinese reversetakeovers  reverse takeover controversial underwriter did someone say rto yes wecast went public through a reverse merger into a shell company in  the underwriting team at the controversial chardan capital markets helped breathe life into the shell source company sec filing chardan is the brainchild of kerry propper whose father started the similarly named chardan capital without the word markets in a  profile of the younger propper observer wrote  in the meantime mr proppers business is evolving late last year he and his father were sued by investors in a  million deal for a chinese firm called huiheng medical its cfo said on a conference call that the company was spending substantial amounts of money paying bribes to officials in control of the chinese hospitals the suit says according to records it was settled this year it was a nonevent mr propper said  usa today reported that chardan capital markets was censured and fined  for three violations of shortselling rules in  the federal government sued the father and son for allegedly failing to make promised payments to a limited partnership that received small business administration money so certainly not the most promising blastoff into the public arena now about the companys big guy   chairmans background chairman wu is such a contributor to wecast that investors have got to consider his background mr wu is a chinese entertainment guru married to a chinese actress he worked for sun new media as both chairman and chief executive mr wu was quoted in a  press release describing that companys hail mary to create an enhanced business strategy and name change to nextmart otcpknxmr dr bruno wu chairman and ceo of nextmart inc commented by changing the companys name to nextmart we have established a powerful brand name under which we can market all of our information and ecommerce services to customers this a critical first step for building the foundation of chinas largest shopping community with an initial focus on womens fashion products over the next  months our enhanced focus gives us the opportunity to leverage our core competence of media and marketing as well as our suite of technologies our knowhow and our market connections but the technologies knowhow and market connections apparently didnt materialize as expected the company proceeded to fall apart heres where nextmart stands now source otc markets  quarterly losses persist institutions say no thanks the stock attracts virtually no institutions leaving shares in the hands of retail investors and the chinese chairman  a potential set up for extreme volatility on the downside source bloomberg lack of big banks interest is not shocking  considering the quarterly losses that go on and on and on quarter after quarter source bloomberg with wecasts recurring losses since inception and an accumulated deficit exceeding  million auditors have substantial doubts the company can continue as a going concern  almost no cash left diluting shareholders heres the cash mess wecast found itself buried in last quarter source company sec filing thestreetsweeper and heres how  since its expenses exceed revenue  wecast rapidly burns through cash sources company sec filings thestreetsweeper so wecast had little choice but to raise cash by selling  million shares of the company stock last november to mr wus controlled company sun seven stars that sale raised  million so wecast could keep its doors open the moneyguzzler had to come up with even more dollars  in the form of that promissory note convertible to stock that wecast called a merger wecasts stockselling history along with the financial messiness convinces us theres more potential ahead for diluting existing stockholders  latest hype wecast issued a promotional press release on valentines day with the announcement that testing of virtual reality and augmented reality headsets is nearing completion the release drops all the big buzz words like vr ar saas and artificial intelligence source company press release this in our view is pure hype before this most recent release the first time wecast used vr in any sec filing was in feb   regarding the merger with sun video which is really just a smalltime manufacturer source company sec filing press release before the valentines day release wecast filings had never before mentioned commerce technology solution or saas or virtual reality or augmented reality so now wecast suddenly wants investors to believe that its really a tech company  rather than a moneylosing video provider that just bought a scooter company the promotional release also underscores wecasts inability to develop and focus on a valid business plan  the reality of virtual reality meanwhile dozens of real companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars even billions in the vr and ar field in which wecast suddenly purports to be an expert the market is already dominated by giants selling headsets including facebookoculus vr  oculus is the indisputable leader so hot that facebook spent  billion for a preshipment product microsoft  microsofts hololens focuses on headset uses such as spatial mapping gesture recognition and voice and speech recognition unlike others hololens is wireless google  googles  google cardboard gamingfocused headset is designed for using vr apps on android smartphones google is also selling its daydream headset worldviz  the companys d interactive and immersive visualization is aimed at universities government institutions and private businesses other established rivals include bricks  goggles marxent labs unity technologies magic leap vuzix castar etc etc conclusion so wecast appears to be a chinesecontrolled scooter and furniture company that parades around as a global supply chain manager and videoondemand provider and consumer management platform developer  and now a headset maker wecasts chairman facilitates mergers with his own companies  one of which is a freebie and the other is actually a debt deal the company has gone through numerous operational changes and still cant seem to decide what it should be doing both the chief executive and chief financial officer have recently thrown on their goggles and scooted away from the whole mess we think stockholders may be wise to do the same this thing is blowing up and when the smoke clears we expect the stock to simmer down to  cents per share disclosure i amwe are short wcst i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not
