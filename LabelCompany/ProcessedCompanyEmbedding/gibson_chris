playing with groundbreaking seattle grungers soundgarden as well as his solo work and his contribution to later bands like audioslave and temple of the dog chris cornell has been a major creative force in alternative music since the mid s in addition to his powerful fouroctave vocal range cornell is a distinguished guitarist and has long shown a love of gibson electrics with some alternative twists the chris cornell es from gibson’s memphis division captures cornellcertified looks and appointments in a great new es built with full gibson quality and tradition behind it the legendary and original thinline semihollow electric is given a clever tweak with a pair of jason lollar™ lollartron® pickups for that fatbutjangly late ’s to early ’s humbuckerfired twang that fuels chris cornell’s tone your choice of an olive drab green or flat black finish in nitrocellulose lacquer with a bigsby™ vibrato option on the former extends the individuality of this unique artist’s model from its superbly original tones to its stunningly distinctive looks the chris cornell es is a powerful new performer from gibson memphis body and neck the chris cornell es is constructed in the image of the original “dot neck” s of the late s with a semihollow body made from laminated maple with a bound top and back and a solid maple center block the result is the perfect marriage of the traditional archtop’s looks and sonic depth and the solidbody’s sustain and resistance to feedback the neck is made from solid mahogany and topped with a bound fingerboard made from handselected rosewood inlaid with simple pearloid dot position markers while the headstock carries a motherofpearl gibson logo and crown inlay pickups and electronics while continuing in the es’s humbucker tradition the chris cornell es departs from the norm with a pair of jason lollar™ lollartrons® made in the style of the original filter’tron® humbuckers of the late ’s and early ’s for a distinctively twangy tone but sized for a gibson pafstyle humbucker mounting the result is plenty of tonal depth and warmth from the semihollow design but with a new clarity and crispness from the lollartron® pickups with excellent hum rejection the pickups are routed through the traditional threeway switch and individual volume and tone controls and topped with clear knobs for a distinctive look hardware the flat black model carries gibson’s legendary tuneomatic bridge with aluminum stopbar tailpiece and there’s a bigsby™ option on the olive drab green model both renditions are equipped with highquality grover™ rotomatic® tuners all hardware is treated to gibson’s proprietary vos process for a gently aged vintage look every chris cornell es comes protected in a black leatherette hardshell case with
