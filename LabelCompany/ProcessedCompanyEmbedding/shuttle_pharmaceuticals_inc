intends to raise  million in an ipothe company is developing a drug that promises to sensitize cancer cells so they are more susceptible to radiation therapyshuttle is only in phase  trials the ipo valuation is unrealistic and management has no previous experience bringing drugs to marketmy opinion is to avoid the ipo quick take shuttle pharmaceuticals pendingsphr has filed to raise up to  million in its ipo the company is developing a drug to sensitive cancer cells to radiation therapy it is only in phase  trials with no expected results announcement date and the proposed valuation is unrealistic my opinion is to avoid the ipo company rockville marylandbased shuttle pharma was founded in  to sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy rt while protecting normal tissue from the negative effects of radiation the company is headed by cofounder chairman and ceo anatoly dritschilo md who is  years old owns  of company stock and president and chief financial officer peter dritschilo md additional cofounders include chief scientific officer for chemistry milton brown  and chief scientific officer for biology mira jung  there are no institutional investors in the company technology shuttles primary drug development centers around ropidoxuridine a halogenated pyrimidine that it believes has hypoxic cancer cell sensitizing properties that when used in conjunction with radiation therapy renders them more susceptible to the effects of radiation the company received a small business innovation research grant from the nih and began phase  safety trials at the brown universitylifespanrhode island hospital in january  the drug is being tested on patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers below is the current status of the companys pipeline for its lead candidate source shuttle pharmaceuticals a second radiation sensitizer candidate doranidazole is being developed in japan by pola pharma the drug is in phase  trials for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancers and shuttle has an exclusive option to license the drug for development and commercialization in the us but as of now has no exercised that option market and competition according to a  report from globaldata the global market treatment size for gastric cancer will grow rapidly from  billion in  to  billion in  a cagr of  source globaldata the main driver for this growth is expected to be premiumpriced therapies for advanced gastric cancer and as a consequence the increased uptake of therapy and lengthier treatment duration the number of gastric cancer cases is expected to exceed  million in  as a result of population aging in the us europe and asia key competitors in the treatment of gastric cancer include roche otcqxrhhby  herceptin taiho  teysunocisplatin eli lilly nyselly  cyramza the company says its cancer cell sensitizing candidate has the potential to apply to other types of cancers financials shuttles recent financial results are typical of clinical stage drug developers in that it has no revenue or resultant gross margin and significant cash use in operations however the low amount of spend on rd and ga expenses todate is unusual for a biopharma developing a new drug below are the companys operational results for the past two years audited gaap source shuttle s revenue     gross margin  na  na cash flow from operations     notably the company did not include interim financials for  yeartodate which is normal and customary for mid or lateyear ipos as of december   shuttle had  in cash on hand and  in liabilities ipo details shuttle intends to raise up to  million in a selfunderwritten best efforts ipo what that means is that there is no minimum to the ipo yet the company says it wont consummate the ipo unless it has sold at least  million also it means that the company is not using an underwriter and instead is using its executive officers and directors to sell the shares directly to potential investors the expected terms are  million shares of common stock at  per share and the ipo will be open for up to  days from the effective date of the s filing after a successful ipo the market cap of the company at its proposed valuation would be approximately  million shuttle intends to use the proceeds from the offering primarily to fund preclinical and clinical trials of product candidate continued hcac small molecule technology platform development working capital and general corporate purposes as well as potential acquisition or inlicensing activities commentary shuttle is developing ropidoxuridine to help make radiation therapy more effective against cancers particularly gastric cancers ropidoxuridine has been shown in other studies in conjunction with drugs to potentially improve therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients and the company believes there are other cancers such as small cell lung cancer sclc that may be possible targets but as to shuttles current phase  trial management has not provided an expected date when results will be published furthermore for the companys second listed drug candidate doranidazole it isnt developing the candidate pola pharm in japan is and shuttle hasnt exercised its option to license it no doubt waiting until phase  trials are further along or completed so shuttle has proposed a  million ipo valuing itself at  million and it only has one drug candidate in phase  safety trials in my opinion due shuttles very early stage of development unrealistic valuation lack of discussion about when phase  trial results will be announced long time range to further clinical trials thin capitalization lack of institutional investors family ownership and shareholder concentration and no successful experience in bringing drugs to market investors should

conducted on a selfunderwritten “best efforts minimummaximum” basis which means i the company will not use the services of an underwriter and our executive officers and directors will attempt to sell the shares directly to investors and ii the offering will be terminated in the event the minimum number of subscriptions set forth herein are not received and accepted by the company we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  if the minimum of  shares is sold and approximately  if all  shares are purchased after deducting estimated offering expenses we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering over the next twelve months for the purposes set forth in the table below the following table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as of the date of this prospectus assuming the sale of    and  of the shares offered hereby assumed percentage of shares sold     price to public           offering expenses     net proceeds

        product acquisition and inlicensing activities     working capital cost of capital raise and general corporate purposes     total use of proceeds         as indicated in the table above if we sell only  or  or  of the shares offered for sale in this offering we would expect to use the resulting net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale of  of the shares and in approximately the same proportions although we will need to prioritize our clinical studies to accommodate the availability of funding ropidoxuridine and doranidazole may be approved by properly designed phase i and ii clinical trials for the orphan disease indications if phase iii clinical trials are required by the fda than an additional  will need to be raised for each of the two clinical candidate drugs if such additional funds are required we will have to either secure additional funding from investors or through a joint development partner the expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors including the progress of our preclinical development efforts the results of any clinical trials and other studies and any unforeseen cash needs all of our research and development programs are at an early stage and successful development of product candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict as a result we cannot currently specify in more detail the percentage of the net proceeds that we may use for each of the listed purposes accordingly we will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our stock pending the use of the proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities certificates of deposit or government securities in the event we do not sell all of the shares being offered we may seek additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above if we secure additional equity funding investors in this offering would be diluted in all events there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available when needed and if available on terms acceptable to us the development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive we compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies as well as technology being developed at universities and other research institutions our competitors have developed are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that enter the market we believe that a significant number of products are currently under development and may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing sales and supply resources or experience than we have if we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate we will face competition based on many different factors including the safety and effectiveness of our products the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products the availability and cost of manufacturing marketing and sales capabilities price reimbursement coverage and patent position competing products could present superior treatment alternatives including by being more effective safer and less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates such competitors could also recruit our employees which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan  fluorouracil fu is an antimetabolite used to treat cancer by injection for colon cancer esophageal cancer stomach cancer pancreatic cancer breast cancer and cervical cancer fluorouracil was patented in  and is an effective and safe drug with radiation sensitizing properties capecitabine an orally available formulation of fu and was patented in  it is used for the treatment of gastric esophageal and other cancers for sensitization to radiation therapy cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor egfr inhibitor used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal lung cancer and head and neck cancers this monoclonal antibody is administered by intravenous infusion and improves the year survival of patients when used in combination with radiation therapy compared with radiotherapy alone platinum based compounds cisplatin carboplatin and oxaloplatin also exhibit radiation sensitizing properties platinum and radiation are used together for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer and for head and neck cancers cisplatin is believed to augment the effects of radiation by inhibiting the repair of radiationinduced sublethal damage bevacizumab works as an antiangiogenic agent it was approved for medical use in the united states in the addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months and may be used with radiation therapy irinotecan is given by injection and is used to treat colon cancer and small cell lung cancer and can be combined with radiation therapy for colon cancer it is used either alone or with fluorouracil company description shuttle is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in  with the goal of becoming the first us pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative firstinclass drugs for sensitizing cancers to and protecting normal tissue from the effects of radiation therapy “rt” the us food and drug administration the “fda” considers new molecular entities as firstinclass if such drugs like our in initial product candidates use a new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition the mechanisms of action underlying our candidate agents have been attributed to i incorporation of iudr a metabolite of ipdr into dna yielding reactive uracil species and dna double strand breaks following radiation exposure and ii doranidazole is a highly reactive molecule that increases dna strand breakage in combination with ionizing radiation under hypoxic conditions in tumors our objective is to improve the outcomes of cancer treatment through rt and reducing its side effects by  sensitizing growing cancer cells rendering them more susceptible to the effects of rt  sensitizing hypoxic cells in tumors that resist regular rt and  activating the dna damage response pathway to protect normal cells located near cancers to our knowledge no drugs utilizing these mechanisms have received fda approval as radiation sensitizers to date we have developed to clinical stage small molecule strategies to sensitize growing cancer cells in tumors to conventional rt and to sensitize treatment resistant hypoxic cancer cells in tumors to large fraction radiation therapy using stereotactic body radiation therapy “sbrt” a preclinical technology delivery platform using histone deacetylase “hdac” inhibitors which are designed to target cancer cells while protecting healthy tissuenormal cells further enhances our product pipeline shuttle has two clinical stage first in class product candidates that we believe will deliver these benefits in conjunction with our technology platform  ropidoxuridine an orally available halogenated pyrimidine with strong cancer radiation sensitizing properties is our lead “clinical phase” product candidate halogenated pyrimidines are incorporated into dna by rapidly growing cancer cells and become more sensitive to the effects of rt we have received a small business innovation research “sbir” contract from the national institutes of health “nih” to fund a phase  clinical trial at and in collaboration with brown university lifespanrhode island hospital to determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers in connection with the trial the national cancer institute “nci” has approved the phase  clinical protocol and agreed to provide drug and clinical data management support to rhode island hospital if we receive positive results from the phase  clinical trial we plan to advance to phase b and phase  clinical trials of using ropidoxuridine in conjunction with rt treatments of patients with brain tumors and soft tissue sarcomas  doranidazole an injectable hypoxic cell radiation sensitizer is our second “clinical phase” product candidate as cancer cells outgrow the blood supply and oxygen availability becomes limiting regions of hypoxia develop within a tumor cancer cells under hypoxic conditions are more resistant to the killing effects of rt electron affinic drugs such as doranidazole are able to reach areas of tumor hypoxia to effect radiation sensitization thereby offering the potential to improve the outcomes of rt treatment by increasing hypoxic cell kill unfortunately first and second generation hypoxic sensitizers used to date have shown neurologic toxicity and little clinical benefit doranidazole which has been developed in japan by pola pharma inc “pola pharma” has been welltolerated in clinical studies conducted in japan and has shown improved survival in a randomized phase  clinical trial of advanced pancreatic cancers when used in combination with intraoperative radiation therapy “iort” as opposed to treatment by iort alone pola pharma has already conducted and completed the aforementioned clinical trials of doranidazole shuttle has secured an exclusive option to license doranidazole for development and commercialization in the us we have not yet exercised our exclusive option and the terms of a license agreement with pola pharma for the commercialization and development of doranidazole are under negotiation we intend to focus on the use of doranidazole for treatment of pancreatic lung and liver cancers in combination with large fraction sbrt which is rt administered in large doses over a several day period as opposed to conventional rt which is generally administered in small daily doses over an extended period of several weeks in addition to our two primary product candidates we are developing and planning to commercialize other cancer radiation sensitizers with radiation protecting properties which target protecting normal tissue during the administration of rt and other first in class products utilizing our hdac small molecule technology platform we have also been awarded two sbir contracts from the nih to  develop prostate cancer cell lines for africanamerican men who are at higher risk for prostate cancer with donor matched normal prostate cells with the goal of establishing  prostate cancer cell lines for research aimed at treating prostate cancer in african american men and  develop predictive biomarkers of prostate patient outcomes following treatment with sbrt the sbir program is designed to encourage small business to engage in federal researchresearch and development “rrd” that has the

industrystandard pricing methodologies including discounted cash flow models whose inputs are based on managements assumptions and available market information significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of cmos are prepayment rates probability of default and loss severity in the event  of default significant increases decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement generally a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates further we retain independent pricing vendors to assist in valuing certain instruments

interest rate resulting in a fair value which approximates the carrying amount the second type carries fixed interest rates which are higher than current market interest rates the fair value of these

line being in runoff o premiums earned decreased  million for the three months march   when compared to the same periods in  the decrease in premiums earned is primarily due to the sale of risk

investments   balance sheet the company had receivables due from reinsurers of  million at march   compared to  million at december   the  million decrease is primarily due to the novation of assumed

liability for policy benefits and claims by segment are as follows in thousands     policy benefits and claims     march    december                    medical stoploss     fully insured health       group disability       individual ah and other                       major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stoploss relate to i frequency and severity of claims ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation changes in utilization and demand for medical services the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols and ii the adherence to the companys underwriting guidelines changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns tend to be representative of future claim development patterns factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures changes in product design changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity the  million increase in ihcs stockholders equity in the first three months of  is primarily due to the  million of net income attributable to ihc and  million of other comprehensive income attributable to ihc partially offset by  million of treasury stock purchases  asset quality and investment impairments the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders although the companys gross unrealized losses on availableforsale securities totaled  million at march    of the companys fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average aa the company marks all of its availableforsale securities to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss these investments tend to carry less default risk and therefore lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments at march   no fixed maturities were invested in noninvestment grade fixed maturities the company does not have any nonperforming fixed maturities at march   the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments there were no securities with fair values less than  of their amortized cost at march   and the company did not record any otherthantemporary impairment losses in the three months ended march   or    the unrealized losses on all availableforsale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the companys impairment policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at march   in  the company recorded  million of net unrealized gains on availablefor sale securities pretax in other comprehensive income loss prior to reclassification adjustments from time to time as warranted the company may employ investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures further deterioration in credit quality of the companies backing the securities further deterioration in the condition of the financial services industry a continuation of the current imbalances in liquidity that exist in the marketplace a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession or additional declines in real estate values may further affect the fair value of these securities and increase the potential that certain unrealized losses be designated as otherthantemporary in future periods and the company may incur additional writedowns capital resources due to its strong capital ratios broad licensing and excellent asset quality and creditworthiness the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity in the event additional funds are required it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations including liabilities for insurance reserves funds on deposit debt and operating lease obligations  however ihc does not believe that its cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  future cash outflows whether they are contractual obligations or not also will vary based upon ihcs future needs  although some outflows are fixed others depend on future events the maturity distribution of the companys obligations as of march   is not materially different from that reported in the schedule of such obligations at december   which was included in item  of the companys annual report on form k    outlook for  we anticipate · a decrease in premiums and earnings due to exiting the medical stoploss business as a result of the closing of the risk solutions sale and coinsurance transaction · continued significant increase in specialty health premiums including shortterm and supplemental health products such as dental accidental medical gap and critical illness products and continued decrease in major medical premiums which is in runoff increasing emphasis on directtoconsumer and career advisor distribution initiatives as we believe this will be a growing means for selling health insurance in the coming years and accompanying startup costs of expanding our sales through our call center career model including our newly launched aspira a mas outreach to the hispanic community and transactional websites · increasing retention in our group life and disability lines of business in  we expect a continuation of the increase in premiums from group longterm and shortterm disability driven by higher retention amounts and a full year of premiums generated by a relatively new distribution partnership · continued evaluation of strategic transactions  as a result of the sale of risk solutions we have significant cash  we plan to redeploy some of this cash in making investments and acquisitions to bolster existing or new lines of business  subsequent to march   specialty benefits made a  million investment in a call center that will begin writing substantially all of its specialty health business with carriers affiliated with ihc  we are currently negotiating several similar transactions · continued focus on administrative efficiencies including a reduced operating loss at ehae · concluding the process to take amic private on march   ihc and its subsidiary independence american holdings corp sold the stock of risk solutions  in addition under the purchase and sale agreement all of the inforce stoploss business of standard security life and independence american produced by risk solutions is coinsured by westport as of january    the aggregate purchase price was  million in cash subject to adjustments and settlements  this transaction resulted in a gain of  million net of taxes and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests  as a result ihc is highly liquid and has excess capital however its medical stoploss line of business will be in runoff which will have a negative impact on future earnings the company will remain highly liquid in  as a result of the continuing shorter duration of the portfolio as a result the yields on our investment portfolio were and continue to remain lower than in prior years and investment income may continue to be depressed for  ihc has approximately  million in highly rated shorter maturity securities earning on average  our portfolio as a whole is rated on average aa the low duration of our portfolio enables us if we deem prudent the flexibility to reinvest in much higher yielding longerterm securities which would significantly increase investment income in the future  a low duration portfolio such as ours also mitigates the adverse impact of potential inflation  ihc will continue to monitor the financial markets and invest accordingly our results depend on the adequacy of our product pricing our underwriting the accuracy of our reserving methodology returns on our invested assets and our ability to manage expenses  we will also need to be diligent with the increased rate review scrutiny to effect timely rate changes and will need to stay focused on the management of medical cost drivers as medical trend levels cause margin pressures  therefore factors affecting these items as well as unemployment and global financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition    item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain an investment portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities options and other derivatives may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments this monitoring includes the maintenance of an assetliability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the companys inforce policies using current assumptions on mortality lapses and expenses then current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows additionally various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group the expected change in fair value as a percentage of the companys fixed income portfolio at march   given a  to  basis point rise or decline in interest rates is not materially different than the expected change at december   included in item a of the companys annual report on form k  in the companys analysis of the assetliability model a  to  basis point change in interest rates on the insurance groups liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company with respect to its liabilities if interest rates were to increase the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance groups interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies and many of the insurance groups universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies additionally there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered if interest rates were to decrease substantially the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income with respect to its investments the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures ihcs chief executive officer and chief financial officer supervised and participated in ihcs evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
