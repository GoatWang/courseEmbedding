products    product pipeline product pipeline with universal biosensors ubi electrochemical strip technology already demonstrated in blood glucose and coagulation testing the company is focused on adding new clinically relevant and commercially attractive tests to its product pipeline  ubi is developing an immunoassaybased biosensor an important technique for biomarker measurement which is progressing through the feasibility stage of the companys rd pipeline  another key opportunity is ubis early but exciting research into molecular diagnostics testing immunoassay the immunoassay is an important technique for biomarker measurement immunoassays account for approximately  of the us billion per annum in vitro diagnostics market and many of these assays could easily be transferred to the fast growing pointofcare segment if a more appropriate technology existed ubis vision in this area is to develop a single analyser platform that can utilise multiple biosensors to analyse a wide array of biomarkers using immunoassay techniques an example of an immunoassay based test that ubi has incorporated in its research program is the ddimer test conditions which are associated with high ddimer levels include deep venous thrombosis clots in the leg and pulmonary embolism clots in the lung pe and dvt collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism vte affect up to  million patients annually and kill up to  of them more than breast cancer and hiv combined however up to  of patients with suspected vte do not actually have the disease a negative ddimer test enables the safe and immediate rule out of vte in suspected cases preventing unnecessary and costly additional testing  in addition to ddimer other immunoassay targets that are experiencing significant growth include cardiac markers and oncology markers with a truly universal immunoassay test ubi will have the opportunity to expand into a broad range of growing markets  molecular diagnostics molecular diagnostics tests are a new wave of cutting edge technology that analyse genetic information  in particular the tests look for genetic mutation or levels of certain genetic material that uniquely identify a cancer or virus for example which may affect the probability of developing a disease aid in the diagnosis of a disease or infection or improve the response to treatment the market for molecular diagnostics is a broad segment including blood screening infectious disease testing genetic testing and oncology testing  molecular diagnostics also has the ability to drive new approaches to therapy by enabling doctors to tailor their therapeutic strategy for each individual based on genetic information the market for molecular diagnostics is valued today at more than us billion worldwide and is expected to grow at more than  annually  ubi anticipates continued growth in this area due to an ageing population and greater incidence of chronic disease a need for earlier diagnosis and faster treatment to reduce healthcare costs an improved understanding of human genetic makeup and how to identify irregularities and advances in chemistry and instrumentation technology ubi has signed a nonexclusive licence agreement with australian company speedx pty ltd for access to its proprietary mnazyme technology which is a highly selective method for detecting sequences of rna and dna ubi hopes to combine these mnazymes with ubis proven biosensor technologies to detect dna or rna electrochemically meaning tests would take minutes rather than the hours typically required for molecular tests today and the system would be simple to use and cost effective ubis vision is to make true rapid and convenient pointofcare dna and rna testing possible blood glucose monitoring coagulation

products onetouch® verio® glucose test onetouch® verio® is the first blood glucose product launched by lifescan that uses the innovative opposing electrode technology developed by universal biosensors  lifescan a johnson  johnson company first introduced onetouch® verio® to the market in january  and it is now available globally onetouch® verio® has been positively received by the market based on key competitive advantages that stem directly from the novel electrochemical approach the onetouch® verio® represents worldclass technology that utilises highly automated state of the art manufacturing system developed by universal biosensors key advantages of the technology in onetouch® verio® enables instant within seconds readings of blood glucose levels requires no calibration and uses a tiny finger prick blood sample less than  µl the result is unaffected by the presence of unrelated sugars such as maltose and galactose which interfere with the results in a number of other blood glucose systems glucose monitoring pointofcare blood tests for blood glucose first appeared in the market in the late s these simple test devices allowed patients to take control of their insulin medication and led to dramatic advances in life expectancy and quality of life for diabetics today it is estimated that around  billion disposable sensor strips using electrochemical cells are used by diabetics each year this remains the largest market in the pointofcare segment and has been valued at more than us billion globally and continues to grow in australia the onetouch® verio® can be found at wwwonetouchcomau xprecia stridetm coagulation analyzer following on from its successful validation with glucose ubi has adapted its electrochemical cell to measure prothrombin time ptinr a test used to monitor the anticoagulant therapy warfarin the test is used to maintain patients on a safe and effective dose if patients are taking too much warfarin they are at risk of serious bleeding events and if too little they are at risk of thrombosis  ubi has signed a long term supply and manufacturing agreement with siemens healthcare diagnostics to manufacture three test strips for the professional pointofcare coagulation testing market  the first product a ptinr test was launched in december   ubi is also developing its own ptinr device for use in decentralised settings including
