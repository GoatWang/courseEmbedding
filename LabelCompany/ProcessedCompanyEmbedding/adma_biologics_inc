for primary immunodeficiency disease is on track for second half  fda approvalwe continue to believe that ri will offer a superior treatment option for a subset of patients with pidd and other immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patient groups at highrisk for infectionswe recently updated our dcf valuation model which pegs fairvalue for the shares at  we have been proponents of adma biologics inc nasdaqadma since we initiated on the company back in june  notable highlights from  include the company receiving fda acceptance of its biologics license application bla for ri and fda approval of its second plasma collection center in addition to strengthening its intellectual property portfolio by receiving a year compositions and methods for treatment patent in our opinion adma remains on track for ri approval to occur during the second half of  at the current price we continue to view adma shares as meaningfully undervalued and as providing significant longterm upside potential we are increasing our price target to  per share and continue to rate the stock a buy brief background on adma adma biologics inc is a latestage biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and intends to commercialize specialty plasmabased biologics for the primary immunodeficiency pidd population and the treatment and prevention of certain infectious diseases admas lead candidate ri is a specialty intravenous immunoglobulin ivig product that contains polyclonal antibodies against various infectious agents that are derived from human plasma ri contains standardized high levels of antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus rsv in addition to naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies such as streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae type b cytomegalovirus measles tetanus etc ri is intended to prevent infections in a subset of patients diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disease pidd and in particular primary humoral immunodeficiency the polyclonal antibodies that are found in ri are expected to prevent infections in this population group adma plans to seek approval for ri for a target population range of approximately  to  patients primarily suffering from pidd presentations potential offlabel followon indications include hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct patients solid organ transplant lung heart liver and multiorgan patients and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the winter months management believes that there is no other ivig product currently on the market that contains standardized high levels of rsv antibodies additionally ri is produced with reported consistent lottolot potency we believe that these features are what differentiate ri from currently marketed ivig products more importantly if approved physicians and patients would have an additional selection for ivig therapy which in our opinion could lead to enhanced quality of life for patients the goal is for ri to replace standard ivig therapy during the winter months for the subset of patients with pidd  the year in review… in our opinion the company has achieved several significant valuecreating milestones during  for the purpose of this update we would like to offer a review of major milestones that the company has achieved during  in addition to offering some insight into what  holds for adma we believe that the company remains laser focused on getting ri approved in  and continues to move in the right direction towards this goal february   adma announces data from phase  trial of ri on february   adma announced positive results on the primary and secondary endpoints from its phase  trial for ri in primary immune deficiency disease pidd at the american academy of allergy asthma  immunology annual meeting secondary endpoints included safety pharmacokinetic nysepk data points including antibody titers for certain agents including rsv antibody levels at various time points after infusion incidence of all serious and nonserious infections lost days of work or school hospitalizations emergency room visits and antibiotic use among others as a reminder on december   adma announced that ri demonstrated positive phase  results and achieved its primary endpoint of preventing serious bacterial infections or sbi in immunocompromised patients with pidd as per the fda sbi are defined as bacteremiasepsis bacterial meningitis osteomyelitisseptic arthritis bacterial pneumonia andor visceral abscess no sbi were reported in patients during the course of the study these results more than meet the requirement specified by fda guidance of ≤  sbi per patientyear adma completed the phase  clinical trial of ri as a treatment for pidd in accordance with the fda guidance for industry safety efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies to support marketing of immune globulin intravenous human as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency the phase  trial was designed as a multisite single arm open label study in which  patients diagnosed with pidd were treated once every  to  days for  months across  treatment centers located throughout the united states the patients were then followed for an additional  days for followup and safety monitoring below the average doses of ri that were administered in the  and  week groups were mgkg and mgkg respectively twentyone patients  had at least  study drug related event within  hours after completion of ri infusion there were only  symptoms evaluated within this time period that were reported by  or more of the subjects  the four symptoms that were reported as drug related events included headache  patients myalgiamuscle pain  patients pruritusitchy skin  patients and adverse drug reaction without further specification  patients scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included a total of  days or  days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection  hospitalization due to an infection of  days duration in the entire study above and igg trough levels above those required by the fda for ivig products below specific antibody levels were also measured for h influenzae cmv measles s pneumoniae  serotypes rsv and tetanus an increase in all of the measured specific antipathogen antibodies in pk subjects n was also observed the mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of ri ranged from  fold s pneumoniae type a to  fold rsv which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogens specific measured baselines below as per adma the safety profile of ri was comparable to that of other immunoglobulins as per the company over  infusions of ri were administered to  patients and were well tolerated with no reported serious adverse events attributable by investigators to the study drug overall we see these results as excellent news for adma and they suggest that ri is safe and effective and could be an important new alternative therapy for a subset of individuals with pidd we think utilizing standardized high levels of antirsv neutralizing antibodies is a unique approach and believe the data supports moving forward with the drug we believe that the data compares favorably with historical clinical data for other marketed immunoglobulin products and the results from the phase  ri trial may allow for the differentiation of the drug candidate from other immunoglobulins for instance with admas ri therapy only  days per patient per year were lost from work or school due to infection as compared to  days missed with gammaplex® and  days missed with flebogamma® schroeder et al  march   adma closes public offering of common stock on march   adma announced the closing of a public offering of  million shares of common stock at a public offering price of  per share as well as  additional shares of its common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters adma walked away with net proceeds of approximately  million the net proceeds of the offering are being used for prelaunch and commercialization activities which include the procurement of commercial inventory and build out of a commercial organization and staffing infrastructure relating to the companys anticipated launch of ri if the fda grants marketing approval for the product in addition to general and corporate purposes june   adma biologics  jeffrey modell foundation initiate strategic patient advocacy alliance on june   adma announced a collaboration with the jeffrey modell foundation a global nonprofit organization dedicated to patients with pidd the jeffrey modell foundation centers network includes over  physicians at over  academic institutions in over  cities approximately  countries in  continents as part of this collaborative effort adma will have access to the jeffrey modell foundations global databases of over  patients who have varying forms of pidd we believe this strategic alliance is crucial in order for adma to raise awareness among physicians and patients regarding ri there are approximately  leading specialty programs for treating pidd patients in the us and we believe adma continues to concentrate efforts on these areas as well june   adma secures up to  million loan commitment from oxford finance adma currently has total debt of approximately  million with oxford finance llc that bears interest of  on june   adma announced that it has entered into a loan and security agreement with oxford for up to  million adma received the first tranche of  million which will be used to repay the existing notes payable with hercules technology growth capital inc beginning on february   the principal must be repaid in monthly installments over the following  months the interestonly period may be extended until august   upon admas receipt of approval for its bla for ri from the fda on or before january   adma has the option to draw upon the remaining additional  million once the bla is approved by the fda if drawn upon it will be used towards ongoing commercialization activities working capital and general corporate purposes june   adma joins the russell microcap® index adma joined the russell microcap® index following market close on june   we believe that this step was important in increasing admas visibility with institutional investors july   adma strengthens commercial team on july   adma announced multiple senior appointments to the companys commercial team as part of the admas ongoing commercialization activities for lead product candidate ri the company announced the appointment of mr james hauert senior vice president of commercialization  strategy dr doris connell pharmd vice president of medical affairs and ms theresa gwaltney senior director of supply chain operations to the team july   adma files ri biologics license application as a reminder on july   adma announced submission of its ri biologics license application bla to the fda seeking marketing authorization of its lead product candidate and the fda had  days to review the application to determine whether admas bla submission for ri was complete and acceptable for filing under pdufa v the bla filing fee is usually  million but since adma submitted a small business waiver application that was approved the company did not have to pay this fee we view this as meaningful and continue to believe the company is on the right track towards approval and commercialization august   adma strengthens intellectual property portfolio on august   adma announced that the us patent and trademark office uspto issued united states patent  entitled compositions and methods for the treatment of immunodeficiency the patent relates to the use of human plasma immunoglobulin compositions containing select antibody titers that are specific for a plurality of respiratory pathogens methods of identifying human donors and donor samples for use in the compositions methods of manufacturing the compositions and methods of utilizing the compositions by prophylactic andor therapeutic treatments such as passive immunization the term of the newly issued patent extends to january  as a reminder on june   adma announced that the us patent and trademark office uspto had issued a notice of allowance for us patent application  entitled compositions and methods for the treatment of immunodeficiency we believe this is great news for adma as it not only strengthens the companys intellectual property portfolio but also offer protection of ri and is an important step towards commercialization of ri if approved september   fda approves second plasma center on september   adma announced that its second plasma center received fda approval to sell human source plasma within the us the center is located in marietta ga and is over  square feet with the potential to support over  donor beds we were expecting the facility to receive approval in the fourth quarter of  or the first quarter of  and so we view this early news as great for the company we still believe that adma continues to retain plasma in order to build up inventory in preparation for commercial manufacturing of ri related to the anticipated product launch during the second half of  and that any plasma that is not used to manufacture ri will be released for sale we are happy to report that adma began generating additional revenues from the newly approved second plasma center sooner than anticipated in the third quarter  we like the concept of adma biocenters plasma collections centers because it is a revenuegenerating and costlowering operation both of adma biocenters are now fdalicensed source plasma collection facilities that provide a portion of plasma for the manufacturing of lead product candidate ri in addition to a revenue stream the norcross georgia facility is also a member of the international quality plasma program iqpp as certified by the plasma protein therapeutics association is gha german health authority certified and mfds korean ministry of food and safety certified in april  adma biocenters received a twoyear recertification from the gha which allows plasma collected at the norcross center to be imported into the eu and to be purchased and processed by european plasma fractionators subsequently in september  the norcross center received mfds approval to sell source plasma into south korea during the third quarter of  the adma biocenters facility expanded by securing additional space to grow its donor and collection screening areas to meet the increase in market demand for source plasma in november  the opening of a second plasma collection center in marietta ga was announced and prior to recent approval the second center was collecting plasma the company started generating accretive revenues from the sale of plasma that was not used to manufacture ri starting in the third quarter  shortly after receiving fda approval management believes inventory of source plasma will continue to increase as adma ramps up for commercialization efforts we believe there may be future opportunity for the company to add additional centers and in turn would result in additional source plasma necessary for ri production as well as additional revenue for the company by selling unused amounts in the us and abroad there are hundreds of diseases that rely on products made from human plasma as treatment and there we believe there continues to be a demand for plasma the trends show that the number of us fda approved plasma collection centers as well as total us source plasma collections continue to increase below adma biocenters plasma collections centers as well as other typical plasma collection centers can usually collect between  to  liters of source plasma annually the plasma can be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma quantity of purchase and market conditions at the time of sale plasma that is collected by the center that is not used for making ri is sold to customers in the us and where it is approved worldwide under existing supply agreements or in the open spot market generating revenues for the company as per adma a fully operational plasma center can generate more than  millionyear september   fda accepts bla for ri on september   adma announced that the biologics license application bla for ri was accepted for review by the us food and drug administration fda the pdufa date for the fda to complete the review is scheduled for the second half of  if all goes well and the bla is approved we could see a potential approval of ri during the second half of  management believes that first commercial sales could also occur as early as the second half of  if approved we believe the proposed dosage would be  mgkg every  or  days during the winter months in the select pidd population or approximately  doses per year management believes based on guidance documented from the us fda that a successful single phase  trial and complete bla submission should lead to final approval of ri november   adma presents additional data at the pidd congress in budapest adma presented a poster entitled protection against palivizumab resistant rsv with an ivig containing high titer anti rsv neutralizing antibodies at the nd international primary immunodeficiencies congress held november   in budapest hungary the data compared the effectiveness of antirsv monoclonal antibody palivizumab synagis®  astrazeneca azn to that of high titer antirsv ri when administered prophylactically to rsv infected cotton rats the data demonstrated the presence of higher antirsv neutralizing activity in ri as compared to that which is present in palivizumab in the animal model p  ; student t test ­tailed and that ivig containing high titer neutralizing antibodies to rsv can prevent infection in cotton rats infected with a palivizumab resistant strain of rsv we believe the  to  fold greater increase in the antirsv neutralizing antibody titers from the serum of cotton rats using ri as compared to the rats injected with palivizumab further supports the unique antibody profile of ri  the year ahead… as mentioned above adma achieved several major milestones in  including receiving the fdas acceptance of the bla submission for ri and obtaining fda approval of the second adma biocenters plasma collection center in addition to strengthening its intellectual property portfolio adma has several anticipated milestones on the horizon and in our opinion the potential approval of ri for the indication of pidd is of utmost importance remaining anticipated milestones that we would like to highlight include continuing commercialization and marketing preparation for ri obtaining fda approval to manufacture and market ri for the treatment of pidd patients first commercial sales of ri continuing to expand intellectual property protection for ri and related ivig products initiating new specialty plasma collection programs at adma biocenters we note that the current management team has met prior commitments and milestones in a timely fashion for instance most recently with the bla filing and fda approval of the second plasma center and we are hoping that the trend continues into  admas current strategy for moving ri forward includes exploring other possible indications for ri developing additional plasmaderived products for the treatment of infectious diseases in immunocompromised patient populations expanding the network of adma biocenters facilities both to maintain control of a portion of the raw material supply and to generate additional revenue through the collection and sale of source plasma to third party customers we expect adma will continue to build out its commercial infrastructure in order to move forward with us commercialization plans adma plans to hire a small specialized sales force to market ri to physician officesclinics hospitals as well as other specialty treatment organizations we expect adma to hire between  sales reps initially we believe that adma will focus on physicians that are concerned with the identification of infections in the immunocompromised patient population which primary attention placed on immunologists and infectious disease doctors we also believe that other specialists such as pulmonologists and hematologists may also be included we expect adma to hire between  sales reps initially additionally the company has recently appointed some new hires to strengthen the commercial team adma also expects to add additional personnel for patient support medical affairs quality assurance regulatory affairs scientific affairs reimbursement inventory and logistics human resources and financial and operational management in order to fulfill orders for ri adma may also use a network of national distributors we believe that the company will need to secure additional financing prior to launching ri in order to support commercial efforts as well as launch expenses conclusion adma had a very busy  and the company has achieved several significant valuecreating milestones during year with the bla for ri in patients with pidd accepted for review fda approval of the second plasma center in place which is now generating revenue and a key patent issued that further expands admas ri intellectual property portfolio we see things as continuing to move in the right direction we continue to view the area of infection prevention such as rsv in immunocompromised patients specifically pidd transplantation and chemotherapy to be one of significant unmet medical need we believe that a polyclonal ivig product that is specifically tailored to highrisk immunocompromised patients that could potentially protect against rsv infection as well as other pathogens would provide a unique alternative treatment option for physicians and patients we believe adma biologics has a product with a unique antibody profile that sets itself apart from other ivig products that are currently on the market due to the unique antibody profile of ri we believe that adma has the opportunity to charge a premium over currently marketed standard ivig products if approved there is a wellestablished fda regulatory path to approval and we see ri gaining approval during the second half of  management anticipates product launch as early as the second half of  if fda approval is received in accordance with the standard review timeline it may take some time for the product to gain momentum but given managements experience of launching and commercializing plasma derived biological products and the sizeable market for ri we believe this is a very attractive opportunity for investors we believe adma is capable of commercializing and marketing ri on its own if approved we also believe that if ri is approved adma could potentially become a very attractive acquisition candidate for a big pharmaceutical or larger biotech company for example we see the possibility for a key player operating in the us ivig market such as baxalta bxlt formerly known as baxter international inc bax biotest ag otcbttay csl behring cslax octapharma ag kedrion spa andor grifols sa nasdaqgrfs becoming interested in the company and a differentiated ivig product like ri as of september   adma had  million of total cash and shortterm investments consisting primarily of  million of cash and cash equivalents and  million of shortterm investments as compared to  million at june   our model suggests current cash provides adequate funding into the second half of  based on our assumptions and increasing the probability of success for ri to  given the recent bla acceptance of the ivig candidate we calculate a fair value for adma at approximately  million with a market cap of approximately  million we feel that the market does not yet fully appreciate admas potential of note in the fourth quarter admas senior management team purchased  shares at an average price of  which in our opinion shows that management not only believes that the shares are undervalued but also that they doing something about it by investing their own capital in the company should ri prove to be an effective treatment for additional indications there is the possibility for significant upside to this valuation in our opinion with positive phase  data in place and the company moving in the right direction towards ri approval we feel as though adma is a relatively low risk investment especially at the current price we continue to view adma as a compelling investment opportunity and look forward to seeing management execute on its strategy we are increasing our price target to  per share and continue to rate the stock a buy disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it
