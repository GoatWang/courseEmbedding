fact that farooq kathwari the multi millionaire owner of the ethan allen furniture company  son irfan aka imran was killed fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan should serve as another cautionary tale that every muslim is suceptible to radical islam farooq kathwari recently spoke at a radical islamist events in the us and his enormous wealth has no doubt made him a donor and guest to be courted by these groups farooq kathwari came from a priviledged kashmiri family  attended new york university worked on wall street and made a fortune as a businessman that his  year old son imran would leave america to be killed fighting as a muhajadeen in afghanistan shows that even a muslim from a modern westernised background can become a jihadi and begs the question of how many more imran kathwaris may be tempted to become jihadis the recent trials and convictions of wealthy and educated american born phd ali al tamimi who earned a  figure salary working for the us department of transport and was jailed for jihad recruitment and abu ali whose father works for the saudi embassy was accused of training with al qaeda and plotting to kill president bush shows that farooq kathwari was an early manifestation of an alarming trend in his blog are muslim americans victimised named farooq kathwari as one of the the most sucessful muslim businessmen in america business tycoons of

brother wrote an entire article about irfan katharis death in jihad entitled my nephew the freedom fighter the article gives a valuable insight into how wealthy american born muslims can get involved in jihad the juxtaposition of a long haired irfan kathwari shooting hoops in driveway of the family farm where his fathers bmw is parked and listening to metallica to his last picture in traditional muslim garb in afghanistan and a note reaffirming hislove for allah kathawaris father was also a high ranking official in kashmir which shows that the family many of whom still live there and continue their involvement in the political life of the region the writer of the article rafiq kathwari has said that after  years he still feels as the same about the struggle in kashmir httpwwwfeaturewellcomdocsignincfmaid my nephew the freedom fighter by rafiq kathwari   words all rights available essays the author an american born in kashmir remembers his cousin who is buried in a mass grave somewhere in the minefields of afghanistan full story my family has a longstanding tradition of activism in kashmir my father was once a finance minister in pakistancontrolled kashmir we had migrated there in  after india and pakistan fought their first war over kashmir my mother wrote letters to world leaders pleading with them not to forget the plight of broken families separated by an artificial cease fire line which in kashmir is called the line of control we returned to indianoccupied kashmir in  after  years there irfans father and i were jailed for several months by indian authorities for our student activism that was the family tradition that influenced my nephew irfan freedom for kashmir was near or so it seemed those events impacted irfan differently then they did me or my brother irfan spent his waking hours that summer at the local mosque sometimes returning home late at night iraq invaded kuwait in august and a few months later when smart bombs fell in baghdad irfan wanted to enroll at king faisal u in islamabad a few weeks later irfan wrote that he and a handful of his new classmates had crossed the pakistanafghanistan border in a toyota pick up several times without being stopped a photo shows him wearing the long shirt the kameez and loose pants the shalwar he is stroking his curly beard there is no kalashnikov on his shoulder love of allah he wrote in another letter is the only love i have ever known on one such trip allahs foot soldier seemingly cast the first stone the enemy released an arc across the sky in their backyard in america his mom was pruning roses under a gunmetal sky the day the call came my nephew is buried in a mass grave in the desolation of afghanistan my brother and sisterin law who believe that their son was killed in a freak accident fighting the soviets are of course entitled to find solace in any idea that helps them come to terms with their sorrow mimthe interviewer refers to imran kathwaris death while fighting jihad in chechyna as his having been the youthful pursuit of a romantic notion and glosses over the death without questioning what could have motivated the son of one of americas wealthiest business tycoons from an assimilated muslim background to become a muhajideen fighter in afghanistan   business week at ethan allen selling furniture and tolerance ceo farooq kathwari has revitalized the company while leading a campaign to bring peace to kashmir httpwwwbusinessweekcommagazinecontentbhtmgrief comfort gratitude patriotism that was the language of most chief executives messages in newspapers around the country after the violence of sept  but m farooq kathwari the head of furniture retailer ethan allen interiors inc eth  a muslim who left kashmir some  years ago and now an american citizen trying to bring peace to that troubled place wrote of something else deep sadness yes but also of the need to foster unity among people of different faiths as community leaders have stated in the days since the twin towers fell kathwari says the terrorists win if the search for justice turns to vengeancekathwari  knows something of how grief and anger work on people his eldest son was killed in afghanistan in  imran a yearold college student born and raised in america was drawn there by romantic notions of the fight against the russians and by that time the regime they backed says kathwari imran went despite the familys opposition he died in a mortar attack in one of the last battles for the capital kabul my son is lying in rubble in afghanistan kathwari saysa death like that could make a parent bitter for life and kathwari was for a while but eventually he decided to get involved not in afghanistan but in kashmir as a diplomat of sorts at least  kashmiris have died or disappeared since  when their renewed call for more autonomy if not independence from india sparked a rebellion that pakistan supports kathwari once a student activist in kashmir brought together a group of predominantly american politicians academics and former diplomats in  to suggest ways to end the civil strife kathwari talking publicly about his work there for the first time says i wanted to try to save parents from the agony of losing a child and kashmir helps me maintain perspectivewhat makes kathwaris experience so interesting is the way in which it has influenced his leadership at ethan allen that most traditional of american retail icons hes as demanding as any ceo but colleagues also talk about his sense of justice and humility as sandra lamenza vicepresident and general manager of the retail division puts it ego is not tolerated you cant throw power aroundkathwari who grew up in a privileged politically active family left kashmir in  to obtain an mba at new york university after a few years on wall street he began importing handicrafts from kashmir in  kathwari sold his company to ethan allen an early client and five years later he was promoted to presidentsince then he has changed almost everything about ethan allen the furniture the design of its plus stores its relationship with dealers and the senior management almost all of whom retired between  and  ethan allen used to sell traditional furniture some of which hadnt been updated in  years in stores that even employees say looked like colonial museums ethan allen was a trusted dusty brand in danger of going the way of the oldsmobile says simon williams chairman of brand consultant sterling group in new york kathwari and his designers made over its valley forge look to suit modern tastes and they now launch new collections more frequently they have also remodeled most stores and relocated half to prime retail spaceat the same time kathwari took on the independent dealers who sold most of ethan allens furniture breaking with industry protocol he told them to sell only the companys merchandise at one price to be set in the danbury conn headquarters he also required them all to buy the furniture at the same price before the bigger dealers received a discount several of them confronted kathwari in  saying do you think you are robin hood youre giving to smaller dealers at our expense to kathwari it was an issue of fairness and that was that two dealers walked outa message now the transformation is almost complete to fend off a hostile bid in  kathwari led a  million buyout that gave him a  stake in the company and more operational control kathwari took ethan allen public again in  at most stores sales have tripled since  and the companys profit margins are the highest of any furniture manufacturer but of course no business is immune to the slowing economy and the likelihood of protracted military action profits for the fiscal year that ended on june  were  million down  from a year ago sales were  million up  as late as june the stock price was holding up well at about  now its trading around  to reduce costs kathwari closed three us factories this year and he is moving some production to southeast asia he still expects sales to grow  in  though that may be optimistic these days the company does have a strong enough balance sheet to weather a recessionkathwari talks often about establishing a moral precedent at ethan allen when corey whitely vicepresident of retail operations won the companys golden kite achievement award in  kathwari said he should think of it as recognition that he fulfilled his responsibilities with modesty and when the company bought a plant in virginia ten months ago he told charlie farfaglia vicepresident of human resources to recognize the employees service with the old company when determining benefits kathwari also speaks of religious tolerance when speaking of it seems appropriate at a christmas dinner he hosted he read from the koran about the birth of jesus after sept  the staff agreed ethan allen should put a public message in a few newspapers they know of my loss they know i believe injustice is a sin he says kathwari wrote the note himselfkathwari is intimately involved some would say overly in running the company that doesnt work to everyones benefit after years of operating without a chief financial officerthe company has a controllerkathwari decided last year to hire william beisswanger from ernst  young llp he left after nine months beisswanger would only say that farooq is very handson i didnt think it was the right place for me kathwari has since hired someone elseany difficulties with the turnaround pale alongside kathwaris efforts to bring peace to kashmir the kashmir study group is an independent effort initially welcomed by no one and still criticized by some as out of touch but over the past five years kathwari has largely persuaded indian and pakistani officials that he is serious fair and worth their time he and his project are highly respected by both sides as well as the us government says a bush administration officialthe groups report released in early  offers a supple approach to sovereignty giving kashmiris a majority of whom are muslim the right to rule themselves within india or pakistan that is a controversial notion among indians who want to retain control and some of them view kathwari with suspicion theyve asked the leaders to imagine a settlement thats fair to both its very helpful just to get people thinking about that says frank c wisner a former ambassador to india who is now a director at ethan allen last year kathwari met with pakistans ruler president pervez musharraf and indian officials close to prime minister atal behari vajpayee he was one of many urging them to talk the two met in the indian city of agra in july and are considering another summit the violence continues a car bomb exploded near the state legislature oct  killing at least  people now though there may be more pressure to bring peace to kashmir says kathwari because then those fighting jihad there would lose an important basekathwari insists that his work in kashmir didnt distract him from ethan allen and the board doesnt seem worried it helps give him a sense of value beyond the furniture business says edward h meyer a director and head of grey global group inc an advertising agency in new york who can argue with that corrections and clarificationsin selling furniture and tolerance people oct  about ethan allen interiors inc

httpwwwadnanorgkathwariphp httpwwwadnanorgkathwariphp mimthis entry on google groups reveals that kathwari is known as a sucessionist leader based in america and that he used the ethan allen company as a front to meet with a kashmiri official to discuss what was said to be timber for furniture manufacture as the writer of the artcle points out  the region in question is does not permit use of forests for timber and the meeting was for political reasons in a discussion of an article entitled letter from a shaheed comments were posted which stated that it was farooq kathwari who motivated his son to quit his medical studies at harvard to wage jihad in afghanistan where he was killed in  see entry below what would be interesting would be to hold a refrendum in jammu  ladakh and the valley and ask each voter which state they would like to live in  if these states were carved out of the present kashmir  its almost certain that most of the muslims of doda and even the valley would vote to join jammu  to stay in india proper and this would be a kind of indirect refrendum  a divisive agenda chief minister farooq abdullahs recent conclave with united statesbased secessionist leader farooq kathwari is seen as part of a larger ussponsored covert dialogue on jammu and kashmir in which the vajpayee government is complicit praveen swami join the dots on the graph charting the future of jammu and kashmir and it is hard to miss the shape staring back from the page on march  chief minister farooq abdullah and a group of his top cabinet colleagues held a closeddoor secret meeting with farooq kathwari a usbased secessionist leader the meeting held at the secretariat in jammu appears to be just part of a larger ussponsored covert dialogue on jammu and kashmir indeed there is growing evidence that the bharatiya janata partyl ed coalition government in new delhi is complicit in this dialogue which could lead to a violent communal sundering of the state kathwari heads the kashmir study group ksg an influential new yorkbased think tank which has been advocating the creation of an independent state carved out of the muslimmajority areas of jammu and kashmir the owner of ethan allen an upmarket furn iture concern which includes the white house among its clients kathwaris associates in the ksg have included influential indian establishment figures notably former foreign secretary sk singh and retired viceadmiral nk nair kathwari was blacklis ted by successive indian governments and on one occasion was even denied permission to visit the country to meet a seriously ill relative shortly after the bjpled coalition took power in  however he was granted a visa it is still unclear at whose initiative the visa was granted but kathwari arrived in new delhi in march  carrying a series of proposals for the creation of an independent kashmiri state called kashmir a way forward the proposals were the outcome of the ksgs deliberations on this first visit he met what one senior intelligence official describes as a whos who of the bjp establishment kathwari also appears to have visited jammu and srinagar staying at the home of a top national con ference politician frontline has so far been unable to establish whether he met abdullah on that occasion public disclosure of kathwaris proposals provoked a minor storm both sk singh and nk nair disassociated themselves from its recommendations nonetheless kathwari seemed encouraged enough to push ahead with a new version of kashmir a way forwar d last september a fresh version of the document was finalised after its preface records receiving reactions from government officials in india and pakistan the new document was even more disturbing than the first at least one ksg member the university of south carolinas robert wirsing refused even to participate in the discussions but the bjp it now appears was not wholly unhappy with the direction kathwari was proceeding in kashmir a way forward outlines five proposals for the creation of either one or two new states which would together constitute what is described in somewhat opaque fashion as a sovereign entity but one without an international personality th e new entity the ksg report says would have its own secular democratic constitution as well as its own citizenship flag and a legislature which would legislate on all matters other than defence and foreign affairs india and pakistan would be re sponsible for the defence of the kashmiri entity which would itself maintain police and gendarme forces for internal law and order purposes india and pakistan would be expected to work out financial arrangements for the kashmiri entity which could inc lude a currency of its own four of five possible kashmiri entities the ksg discusses involve two separate states on either side of the line of control loc and territorial exchanges between india and pakistan but the fifth kashmiri entity outlined in kashmir a way forward  of a single state on the indian side of the loc  is the most interesting of the ksg proposals premised on the assumption that pakistan would be unwilling to allow the creation of a new entity on its side of the loc  although there is no discussio n of what will happen if india were to be similarly disinclined  the new state would come into being after a series of tehsillevel referendums all the districts of the kashmir valley the districts of kargil and doda three northern tehsils of rajouri and one tehsil of udhampur the ksg believes would opt to join the new kashmiri state kashmir a way forward attempts somewhat desperately to prove that its assumptions are not based on communal grounds all these areas it argues are imbued with kashmiriyat the cultural traditions of the vale of kashmir andor interact ext ensively with kashmirispeaking people but this assumption is patently spurious for several of these areas also interact similarly with peoples who do not speak kashmiri there is no explanation for example as to why the linguistic cultural and tra de links between the three northern muslimmajority tehsils of rajouri district and the three southern hindumajority tehsils are of any less significance than those they have with the kashmir region nor is it made clear what linguistic affiliation the tehsils of karnah and uri in kashmir where just  per cent and  per cent of the population were recorded as kashmirispeakers in the  census the last carried out in jammu and kashmir might have with the valley indeed these tehsils have recorded some of the highest voter turnouts in successive elections from  suggesting that their residents have little sympathy for kashmir valleycentred secessionist politics similarly while ramban and bhaderwah tehsils in doda are not kashmirispeaking and principally trade with jammu the ksg proposals make the a priori assumption that they would vote to join the new state officials in jammu and kashmir seemed uncertain of just what kathwari and abdullah discussed during their meeting state chief secretary ashok jaitley told frontline that the meeting had indeed been held but said that he was unaware of just what was discussed what i can tell you is that the initiative for the meeting was not ours he said and that the highest quarters were consulted before it was held others said kathwari had requested the meeting to discuss a potential timber business in the state neither the jammu and kashmir directorate of public relations which handles media interaction with the chief minister nor abdullahs personal staff responded to queries from frontline even leaving aside the minor point that following supreme court orders felling forests is illegal in jammu and kashmir it seems implausible that the content of kathwaris dialogue with abdullah centred on raw material for ethan allen the national confe rences proposals for jammu and kashmirs future have striking similarities with those that the ksg is touting the controversial report of the regional autonomy committee rac which was tabled in the jammu and kashmir assembly last year frontline  july   and is in the process of being implemented bears similarities with the ksg proposals muslimmajority rajouri and poonch are scheduled to be cut away from the jammu region and recast as a new pir panjal province the single districts of buddhistmajority leh and muslimmajority kargil too will be sundered from each other and become new provinces in some cases the rac report and the ksg proposals mirror each other down to the smallest detail for example kashmir a way forward refers to the inclusion of a goolgulabgarh tehsil in the new state there is in fact no such tehsil gool and gulabgarh were parts of the tehsil of mahore the sole muslimmajority tehsil of udhampur district until  gool subsequently became a separate tehsil but the proposal for mahores sundering from udhampur and inclusion in the chenab province was fi rst made in the rac report according to the rac plan as in the ksg proposals mahore would form part of the chenab province while udhampur would be incorporated in the hindumajority jammu province significantly abdullahs plans for the future of jammu and kashmirs relationship with india match the ksgs formulation of a quasisovereign state the report of the state autonomy committee sac which was released in march  and is now under cons ideration by the centre would leave new delhi with no powers other than the management of defence external affairs and communications fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution for example would no longer apply to jammu and kashmir if the sac has its way they will have to be substituted by a separate chapter on fundamental rights in the jammu and kashmir constitution which now contains only directive principles the supreme courts jurisdiction over jammu and kashmir will end and the state election commission will conduct polls in the state not the election commission of india while the national conferences demands for greater autonomy are in themselves not disturbing the context in which they have been made and their character are for one the sac proposals were pushed through without debate in the assembly and a nationwi de political debate on the issue promised by abdullah never took place meaningful autonomy seems to be the last of the sacs concerns the report does not contain even one sentence about financial autonomy essential  what would be interesting would be to hold a refrendum in jammu  ladakh and the valley and ask each voter which state they would like to live in  if these states were carved out of the present kashmir  its almost certain that most of the muslims of doda and even the valley would vote to

away the dots on the map charting the future of jammu  kashmir are starting to join together into a striking picture the jammu  kashmir chief minister dr farooq abdullah held a onetoone closeddoor

with mr kathwari suggests that the union government is engaged in a dialogue on plans that would in effect amount to a fresh partition of jammu  kashmir this time on communal lines mr kathwari heads

you is that the initiative for the meeting was not ours he said and that the highest quarters were consulted before it was held neither the jammu  kashmir directorate of public relations which handles media interaction with the chief minister nor dr abdullahs personal staff responded to queries while officials contacted in new delhi argued that the kathwariabdullah meeting had no significance the facts appear to suggest otherwise the ksgs specific suggestions for the powers of the new entity are remarkably similar to those proposed by jammu  kashmirs state autonomy commission sac the sacs report now under consideration by the union government would restore the states  constitutional status giving it power over all subjects barring defence and external affairs significantly no major union government figure has taken issue with the proposals the communal ripping apart of jammu  kashmir suggested in the ksg report has also found expression in the controversial recommendations of the jammu  kashmir regional autonomy commission rac the rac proposes to create a series of communallyhomogeneous provinces mirroring the ksg reports cartographic content down to the last tehsil more than a few observers believe that the dialogue now in progress could lead to an internal partition of jammu  kashmir with the muslimmajority provinces gaining quasiindependence and the hindumajority regions being further integrated in india interestingly the pakistani journalist mr talat hussain reported last year in the nation that the backchannel negotiators during the kargil war mr niaz naik and mr rk mishra had discussed what was described as the chenab plan for kashmir the chenab plan which according to mr hussains report was documented in a pakistani proposal an indian response and a second pakistani proposal suggested recognition of the loc as the border followed by the grant of autonomy to kashmir valley several us establishment figures too have argued that india needs to make concessions in this direction the secrecy shrouding such dialogue has fuelled fears that the bharatiya janata party bjpled union government is engaged in an exercise that could have serious repercussions the communist party of india marxist mla mr my tarigami told business line that the senior bjp leader mr kr malkani had at a conference last month told him that a division of jammu

jihad and trivialises  with an article entitled kashmir dispute will make ground zero seem like a bonfire kashmir dispute will make ground zero seem like a bonfire by rafiq kathwari when i was a teenager about  years ago and in my final year in college in srinagar the summer capital of kashmir the movie battle for algiers was a big hit it captured my imagination as well as that of my classmates one of whom approached me a few days later and asked if i would commit myself to the liberation of kashmir yes of course i said reading a typed sheet my friend took out from his coat pocket bear arms against a sea of troubles i remember the title said this is our manifesto my friend said as i read the aims and objectives which included blowing up bridges and the local radio and telephone buildings ambushing army convoys and killing soldiers the text said nothing about where we would get arms and ammunition the number of members in the group how we would organize who our leader was or when we would execute our plan however i remember the manifesto was long on the why with each point emphasized in the present tense our cause is freedom india promised us a referendum on our future but fails to keep its promise prime minster nehru the last englishman to rule india has kept our popular leader sheikh abdullah in jail for over  years to the extent that india denies us our fundamental rights and subverts its own constitution to that extent india is not a democracy it was great stuff for my impressionable mind my friend had energized me if the algerians could do it so could kashmiris i read the typed manifesto again before signing it with a flourish a few weeks later that teenage flirtation landed me for  months in srinagars central jail where i met  of my classmates who had also signed the manifesto the college principal had been somehow alerted to the plan and called the police subsequently india announced that it had cracked a dangerous gang of terrorists trained in pakistan there was no trial we were just locked up and forgotten until one beneficent proindia sycophant in kashmir was replaced by another who ordered an amnesty soon after i fled to the future of other continents the passage of  years hasnt dimmed my memory my passion for kashmirs freedom is undiminished despite the horror of the last ten years during which anywhere from  to  mostly civilians have been killed maddened by merciless hinduization of kashmirs muslim culture the lack of career opportunities and indias repeated betrayals during the past  years a rag tag army of young kashmiri men took on the third largest army in the world to obtains arms those young men crossed the line of control that divides indian from pakistani administered kashmir rode in buses to kabul where armaments supplied by the cia to the mujahideen were readily available after the soviets withdrew from afghanistan india calls those kashmiri youth cross border terrorists and blames pakistan for supporting them pakistan which has competing claims on kashmir calls them freedom fighters many kashmiris i know simply say a plague on all your houses which of course includes my adopted homei know its politically incorrect to say it the united states many young native kashmiri men who took up arms against a sea of troubles are dead or languishing in indias jails the fighting now is being mostly done by foreign mercenaries recruited by the elusive mr bin laden whose socalled martyrs have changed the tenor of kashmirs legitimate struggle to that of an islamic jihad against hindu india see we told you so india is screaming kashmiris are terrorists india has fueled western fears of resurgent islam propagandizing the militancy as fundamentalist which in turn enables india to flout all international codes of conduct in kashmir if all kashmiris are terrorists and must be smoked out of the himalayas by  indian troops stationed there then let us at the very least agree on a working definition of terrorism which must include both the unofficial and official variety but wait lets be honest prior to the militancy india portrayed kashmir as the model for secularism in india as the warp of her pluralist democracy what has propelled kashmiri society seemingly overnight from a model of secularism to deranged fanaticism under the present ultra right wing regime indian society is becoming increasingly intolerant and absolutist there is a profound disturbance within mother india many indians i know think of india as a super power next only to the united states i will believe that when kashmir the source of five great rivers gets a basic sanitation system and an unrestricted flow of electricity the kashmir valley itself generates kashmiris have been enslaved for generations the west is finally taking note of the fact that regional conflicts have a global reach nothing is remote anymore it never was now we must do whatever is necessary to win the hearts and minds of alienated peoples such as the kashmiris restore their dignity fulfill longstanding promises and watch how swiftly kashmiris sign a manifesto to honor democracy in a world that has changed

fomite press  earned rave reviews from publishers weekly kirkus reviews and booklist bostons npr station named it one of  good reads for the summer he is a senior writer for inc magazine ilanmochari senior writer incilanmochari write a comment credit present life ceo of ethan allen a million manufacturer and retailer of furniture with  stores and  plants headquartered in danbury conn former life political activist in kashmir where kathwari grew up students were beaten arrested police would use their sticks he says in the early s kathwari regularly led protests and marches for kashmiri selfrule times were riotous then the ruling indian government had kept kashmiri leader sheikh abdullah in jail since  also india was blamed when a holy relic of the prophet mohammed was missing from the hazratbal shrine in srinagar on a plane kathwari met an american journalist who was in kashmir to cover the relics disappearance after taking the journalist around to demonstrations kathwari got into trouble with the kashmiri government in  he came to america and requested political asylum lessons learned if your nations been fighting for selfgovernance since  you realize that to change things sometimes takes a long time that helped kathwari cope when he became president of ethan allen in  for seven years prior to kathwaris arrival there the companys sales had been mired at about  million i had to change our whole image early american colonial was no longer a style category people wanted we sold  of our line during four months of the year and we didnt have unified national pricing says the ceo when we started doing one cost we had to raise prices in the east there was opposition from the eastern independent retailers who were used to doing things their way and were worried theyd lose money kathwari convinced the east coast retailers that their shortterm losses would ultimately be worth it when the company became a stronger national presence but we needed to do it in stages kathwari says trying to do everything at once would have meant failure before implementing unified pricing kathwari made several incremental changes all of which were initially resisted by the independents he banished other brands from ethan allen stores he flew  instore salespeople to danbury to persuade them that the companys new styles would sell enough to support brand exclusivity and he switched the companys advertising strategy from more than  locally managed ad campaigns to one nationally coordinated push kathwaris patient revolution has paid off stabilizing the company and preparing it for the next big leap ecommerce wed have a tough time doing ecommerce though if we didnt have one price nationally he says but thats all a major result of work we started

loading reference id cecedcccbc powered by perimeterx  inc profile m farooq kathwari articles  profile m farooq kathwari published by the new york sun on  quietspoken and quietly selfconfident farooq kathwari  chairman president and chief executive officer of ethan allen inc  is not one to boast about anything not even about the profitability of his yearold furniture and home furnishings corporation which has  independent and companyoperated stores around america and dozens more in  locations around the world neither is he likely to suggest satisfaction that in a  billionayear industry scores of his competitors have fallen by the wayside  especially in the recessionary times of the last three years  while ethan allen has gone from strength to strength about the only prideful comment coming from mr kathwari is what he said yesterday to the new york sun ethan allen is in a better position today than it has ever been indeed it is the company  whose stock eth is traded on the new york stock exchange  has a market capitalization of  billion its stock closed at  yesterday with trading of  shares its retail sales of  billion in  produced pretax profits of  million ethan allen gave its shareholders  million in extra dividends the danbury connecticutbased company which has been averaging annual growth of at least  over the last five years has no debt and an operating cash flow of at least  million annually enables mr kathwari to engage in bold expansion at a time when the rest of the industry is contracting in the last dozen years some  furniture stores have gone out of business in america alone mr kathwari will allow that our industry is in a great stage of confusion and transition thats because new distribution channels and specialty retailing have hurt traditional manufacturers who relied on oldfashioned production and marketing techniques cheaply produced furniture from the orient flooded american stores and many domestic manufacturers simply werent able to cope with these imports many also remained mired in moribund designs vainly trying to cater to a constituency of consumers that had long moved on to more modernism in their choice of home furnishings but mr kathwari understood long ago that the furniture business could not remain fastened to tradition ethan allens colonial designs had remained unchanged since  when its factory in beecher falls vermont started massproducing furniture that sold at  a piece neither had the trademark facades of its stores  each having a distinctive colonial spire  changed in the  years preceding his becoming the companys president mr kathwari set about engendering dramatic changes in ethan allens products as well as the architecture of its stores the idea was to inject a contemporary sensibility into the companys brand that meant changing the ethan allen look from what mr kathwari characterizes as a colonial to a classic and contemporary aesthetic what customers see as our signature style today is quite different from the way the ethan allen brand was seen in years gone by he said you have to be a leader in style and decorating what does that mean that means innovation it means understanding consumer tastes and shaping your products to cater to those tastes that means being a brand leader being a brand leader in turn means a relentless emphasis on reinvention a word that mr kathwari institutionalized at ethan allen since he became president  years ago there are no sacred cows at ethan allen he said we are constantly reassessing constantly reexamining our products that work is done by some  consultants and by  other company employees at the companys  manufacturing plants in america it is done by associates in various parts of the world with whom mr kathwari continually keeps in touch by email telephone and through frenetic travel the reinvention is done most of all by mr kathwari himself he acknowledged yesterday that he possesses an inborn instinct for opportunity when an opportunity for innovation and growth comes along i seize it he said i am always focused on doing my best that means hard work lots of hard work and so new stores are opening in china korea japan taiwan the philippines and other parts of asia in europe and of course all across america new product lines are being added we have created a brand thats not only known but is preferred he said our objective is to double our business mr kathwari told the sun yesterday after a lunch in his honor at the asia society on park avenue and st street lest that sound excessively ambitious it should recalled that farooq kathwari has succeeded at virtually everything that hes done since his student days in kashmir in the early s as an english literature and political science major at college in that disputed himalayan territory thats claimed by both india and pakistan he was captain of the cricket team indeed he still talks of those halcyon days and asserts that captaining a cricket team of  often disputatious players taught him more about leadership than anything that he subsequently learned while picking up a mba at new york university and while working in senior positions at bear stearns and rothschilds he also talks with fond remembrance of his grandfather the late gulam mohidin who was a grand old man  imposing in looks charming in manner and a true connoisseur of fine objects and oriental rugs to this day mr mohidins company makes the most exclusive kashmiri carpets which continue to be exported to the best stores all over europe and america vibhuti patel an assistant editor at newsweek international and an indian who now lives in new york says she remembers the time when bloomingdales buyers were regular visitors in the kashmiri capital of srinagar the hardeyed buyers came to place their customized orders  paler colors pastels in classic designs styles that would be more in keeping with western color schemes  with mr kathwaris uncle and his fatherinlaw and first cousins who ran the business after mr mohidin the kathwaris tiny factory still employs the most gifted rug weavers in kashmir ms patel said yesterday but what a long way farooq has come from that remote valley and a familyrun enterprise that is generations old his grandfather the shrewdest of businessmen would have been justly proud of his achievements in the new world the assembling of those achievements began in earnest in  when ethan allen formed a joint venture with mr kathwari to develop home furnishings products in  the joint venture company merged with ethan allen and mr kathwari joined the company as a vice president in  he was promoted to senior vice president and was elected a director of the company he became executive vice president in buyout of ethan allen from interco and in  he organized an initial public offering of the companys  and president in  in  ethan allen made him chairman and ceo in  mr kathwari led a management common stock whatever i do i do with passion mr kathwari said yesterday at every stage of my career i have focused on doing my best i dont take myself seriously but i take my work very seriously that element of seriousness is particularly applied to his colleagues mr kathwari is a huge believer in developing teams of decisionmakers all the associates at our scores of stores in america and around the world are ceos in their own right he said i believe in a collaborative cooperative approach making sure that we are all going in the right direction i have set about creating an entrepreneurial participant culture in ethan allen from our sawmills to manufacturing plants to distribution centers to our inhouse advertising unit i have tried to infuse our organization with a forwardthinking entrepreneurial culture translation mr kathwari helps set clear priorities and then ensures that they are implemented my overriding goal is always to be that cricket captain he said i want to help people become better at what they do im not a control freak i believe in treating my team members with dignity theres little doubt that his approach works this reporter got an opportunity some time back to observe mr kathwari mingle with colleagues at the inauguration of a renovated ethan allen store near atlanta the scene was like a southern revival meeting with dozens of employees trying to hug him get his attention and even ask for his autograph its a fair bet that there arent too many ceos out there who elicit that kind of outpouring of sentiment from their employees part of that sentiment surely flows from the recognition that under mr kathwaris leadership ethan allen has undergone a dramatic repositioning to increase the companys consumer reach and market share elements include the creation of a new corporate identity the redesign of over  of its products the renovation of its network of stores and the retooling of its manufacturing and distribution operations according to company literature but part of that special relationship that mr kathwari enjoys with his colleagues surely stems from the regularity with which he stays in touch with them yesterday morning for example he sent off several hundred emails asking for ideas concerning the development of new products by the time he returned home to westchester his laptop had recorded several dozen responses again not too many ceos would stay so closely in touch with their workforce it helps that ethan allen is in only one business  home furnishings mr kathwari said im not distracted i can focus on what it takes to strengthen the company a company is only as good as the people who work for it motivating people as much as establishing financial goals is part of my job description the job also involves evangelizing in behalf of ethan allen mr kathwari chairs several nonprofit organizations including the kashmir study group  which attempts to fashion a peaceful solution for the long troubled land  and of refugees international hes a life member of the prestigious council on foreign relations a trustee of the world conference on religion and peace a director of the henry l stimson center and of the institute for the study of diplomacy at georgetown university the american jewish committee gave him its national human relations award and the antidefamation league gave him its humanitarian award mr kathwari has special words for america i did it my way he says of his success and i did it for america i am profoundly moved by the history of this country  i can actually visualize myself having lived here  years ago in ethan allens time america gave me the opportunity to be what i am these are feelings that he will convey to president george w bush on friday when mr kathwari attends a white house event appropriately enough its a musical tribute to another american president whom mr kathwari of srinagar danbury westchester and new york also admires

doctorate degrees company brief offering interior design solutions through a network of nearly  dedicated design centers in the united states and abroad ethan allen interiors inc wwwethanallencom is a leading interior design company and manufacturer and retailer of home furnishings the company’s  design professionals provide clients with comprehensive design expertise and service using the full range of ethan allen home furnishings how has the economic crisis impacted the ethan allen brand and what is your view on positioning the brand going forward in december of  i got my main leadership together and i used two analogies to explain our situation the first was from my experience as a mountain climber mountains teach you that if you go too high you can’t breathe and you have to come down it’s okay to come down because you stabilize yourself and then you can go back up staying at an altitude where you can’t breathe is deadly i told my associates “we are at about  feet i would like us to come down to  feet stabilize and then go up again” the second analogy i used i learned from a farmer whose apple trees i used to help trim he said “a healthy tree needs to be trimmed but don’t trim it too much at one time or you will kill it” so in our process of pruning we knew we had to be careful not to trim to such a degree that we killed our healthy tree with these things in mind we were able to manage scaling back at ethan allen we made very tough decisions on issues like consolidating our manufacturing and logistics operations and letting people go which we didn’t want to do but which was necessary to help make us stronger it has also given us an opportunity in the past year we have accomplished more than we could have anticipated our people were ready for change and they understood that reinvention was critical to our future success the good news is that since october  business has been coming back we are healthier and stronger and we have been able to hire again at our manufacturing and retail operations key among the changes we had to make was the consolidation of our wood products to three us facilities from the  we had a few years back last year we also consolidated all upholstery manufacturing into one facility in north carolina both moves allow us to go forward with our best manufacturing operations in the us and still be competitive the next thing we looked at was logistics we have to move furniture from our manufacturing plants to distribution centers to our clients’ homes across the country we had been continuously improving this process but last year gave us a real opportunity for change that we would not have had if business had continued at its pre pace we consolidated all of our distribution logistics primarily into one major national distribution center our way forward rests largely on the fact that we are a globally integrated company that still makes  percent of its products in the united states while most of the rest of our industry has closed their us operations and outsourced the challenge of manufacturing in the united states today is a national problem unless you make a commitment to it and are willing to make strategic improvements at a very small margin or even at a loss you’re not going to be able to manufacture here we made the commitment for a number of reasons first quality and reliability are cornerstones of our brand and our american manufacturing base fosters both and differentiates us favorably in the mind of the consumer second we have the integrated business structure to support american manufacturing and third we have the strategy and technology in place to make our us manufacturing efficient outside of the plant consolidations have there been other process changes that you have made in reaction to the weakened economy the recession gave us an opportunity to do something that has created a major competitive advantage for us we decided to develop manufacturing processes in the us that allow us to deliver custom madetoorder wood furniture products mirroring our existing allcustom upholstery business this was done to combat the commoditization happening in our industry where others especially those who manufacture in developing countries may have a price advantage over us starting with dining furniture we began converting the manufacturing process in our wood products plants to a custom one for  years we have produced anywhere from  to  units of a completed table now we make parts that are assembled when an order comes in that gives us the ability to offer a tremendous number of options and finishes to our clients and is also integral to maximizing efficiency we designed new retail footprints to maximize productivity per square foot and to be sure that going forward all ethan allen design centers will be the right size for each location ethan allen las vegas design center we developed new technologies enhancing our stateoftheart web site introducing touch screens to the design centers and launching a new retail information system and we made changes in response to the new attitude of consumers – they were afraid to spend and there is still reticence we worked to offer rare savings opportunities and good financing terms we did this because it was critical to maintaining our business stability and cash flow today we are much stronger because of it what is it about the culture of the company that allowed your people to understand the need for change and the benefits that would result from it change is not easy but reinvention has always been a part of the culture at ethan allen it’s leadership’s responsibility to accept the necessity of change and to manage it we work hard to get the message across about why change is being made and why it’s important continuous communication is critical both internally and externally i speak to our associates every two months and we have frequent communication meetings as a result most everybody is aware of what we are doing across all industries leaders talk about the opportunities in china but many also talk about the challenges of doing business there have you been happy with how the brand is positioned in china we have built a presence there through a partner and in a short period of time together we have become one of the larger furniture retailers in china with  design centers there do you foresee opportunities for the brand in other emerging markets we do we have invested a lot in the us but are also focused overseas we have a presence in a number of countries from the philippines to japan to taiwan to thailand last year we opened in jordan and dubai and we’re looking at europe ethan allen provides a total package of onestop shopping for home furnishings with great quality products and on top of it our philosophy is centered on service we stand out because of the interior design expertise and help that comes as part of the package when you buy from ethan allen people throughout the world desire a unique combination of products and services has it been challenging for you to remain engaged in all parts of the business especially as you’ve grown overseas no when i was young i was the captain of a cricket team i base my management philosophy on that experience my job as captain was to have all members feel that they were a part of one team and to make sure that team was well trained and did well the difference between having a captain who plays with the team and as part of the team versus having a captain who is not “playing” with the team is critical to our success organizations need a captain who is right there with them our business model at ethan allen is based on teams we have hundreds of teams right now from manufacturing to logistics each design center is run by a “captain” motivation for me is like playing sports you have to keep on playing and you have to do your best to win how much did your earlier role in competitive sports shape your management style as i mentioned above the captain of a team plays with the team i also strongly believe that leaders must conduct themselves fairly establish priorities and explain those priorities to their team members at ethan allen i use the word “justice” as part of our leadership principles justice means dealing fairly which is not easy it means consistently doing what you believe is right which also means you’re willing to risk the occasional loss ethan allen’s leadership principles could just as easily be titled kathwari’s leadership principles did you have to get your leadership team to buy in to that and how critical was it to communicate that those principles are the core of the culture these principles have been part of our culture for many years and they are the core of how we run the company our culture is based on doing what we believe is right i don’t want people to hide things if anything is wrong we want to know the culture is not about trying to please people externally just for the sake of pleasing them we’re a public company so we have to make sure we do things right our culture dictates that people treat their associates with dignity but also maintain discipline these are principles that our people want to follow through on your culture is also focused on being a good corporate citizen how critical is that focus and is that a responsibility today of businesses and business leaders it’s part of the overall responsibility of any organization but you have to make sure that you are doing well at home before you start doing things outside so as an organization our primary responsibilities are to our customers we have to treat them well provide them with great service and give them the best possible value to me that is social responsibility we also have thousands of people who work in our organization – they have families so we have to make sure that their welfare is also taken into consideration additionally we are involved with communities where we work many of them depend on us and it is our responsibility to deal with them fairly even though the past few years have been tough after that we can get involved with other good causes does it concern you that the us is losing its competitive edge globally and is there not enough being done to cultivate innovation and leadership that is a major concern however we have the opportunity to revitalize this recession has given us an opportunity to do things we could not have done before because our people are ready crisis has created an opportunity and we should not miss it the good news is that the us today projects the diversity of the world we have talent and ideas from all over so as a nation we need to go back to focusing on creative ideas rather than on financial maneuvering as we have recently focused on those who know you say it’s hard to imagine a time when you will slow down will that day come one of the other important responsibilities of leadership is to make sure you leave the organization stronger than when you came in which means having strong people as long as i am the ceo i have to be the team captain but when the day comes that i don’t have to be then somebody else has to take it on you cannot be a leader  or  percent you have to be full charge or out do you ever step back and appreciate your success or do you always look ahead i’ve always believed in maintaining a balance between ethan allen and a lot of other things i do i have been very interested in trying to help reach solutions in international conflict and the plight of refugees and displaced people this gives my life balance while making money is okay if that is the only measurement of success you’re going to make a lot of mistakes and you will never be satisfied my involvement with nonprofit organizations has given me an opportunity to contribute and has also helped me maintain perspective because when you look at world problems our problems as an organization seem relatively small• download a pdf of leaders interview with farooq kathwari chairman president and chief executive officer ethan allen interiors inc
