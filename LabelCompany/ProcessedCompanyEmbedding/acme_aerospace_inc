conditions  new product line  lithium batteries lithium power systems you can depend on lithium batteries acme aerospace inc is on the forefront of advanced battery chargers and battery management system design our unique inhouse capabilities and experience allows us a distinct approach to liion batteries with a focus on safety performance reliability and system integration  acme is currently the battery supplier of choice of the sikorsky s raider platform and is a team sponsor under avionic instruments llc   it is extremely important when considering the use of liion battery systems for airborne applications to consider its performance parameters environment and how the battery is expected to integrate with the rest of the electrical system architecture especially the charger and battery management system  these issues must be addressed and overcome on any platform in order to satisfy the current faa special conditions safety criteria established by the authorities   acme’s smart lithiumion battery system contains a balance between power density reduced weight and the necessary levels of redundant safety features to ensure fault isolation and avoid propagation failure the engineers at acme have evaluated all available chemistry options for lithiumion cells and have identified multiple reliable sources for the different chemistries lithium iron phosphate has been chosen due to its thermal stability characteristics and overall safety the battery system design includes the cells charger battery management system bms and associated electronics to maintain the battery in a charged condtion and provide power when required for engine starting  the function of the bms is to monitor evaluate and protect the lithium chemistry cells   acme aerospace’s liion battery system consists of the following components    lithium ion battery – the arrangement of cells is dependent on the technical parameters of the specified battery but all cells are arranged in a physical configuration utilizing specific thermal materials to prevent cell failure propagation    battery charger the charger converts the unregulated  vdc input into a constant current constant voltage cccv output to charge the battery    battery management system bms  the bms provides full protection for the battery in the case of overvoltage undervoltage and overtemperature conditions  the bms also controls the series cell balancing is achieved using a microcontroller   please contact us at aerosalesacmeaerocom for more information   battery accessories power systems you can depend on

aerospace has an extensive history in the design and manufacture of emergency backup batteries battery chargers and battery assemblies  advanced concepts in power conversion lead to significant weight savings over the competition related experience   expertise in charge control design has resulted in acme receiving development contracts for chargers to accompany leadacid sealed leadacid vented nickel cadmium sealed nickel cadmium sealed fiber nickel cadmium batteries nickel metal hydride and lithium ion   acme aerospace possesses over  years experience in the custom design and manufacturing of acdc and dcdc converters  acme’s reputation has been built by thousands of converters and charge control units successfully flying on both military and commercial aircraft around the world “zero maintenance” sealed fiber nickel cadmium fnc battery system   in addition acme has developed and manufactures the sealed fiber nickel cadmium fnc battery system supporting the world’s only battery which is in use on the boeing  apache ahd md apache aha and f falcon   acme can also provide main battery chargers for all battery technologies emergency backup power supply history   acme established itself as a leader in emergency backup batteries with the release of its airborne modular power supply amps  the amps family leveraged off the reduced weight of sealed nickel cadmium cells coupled with an internal charger and controller   typically selected in applications where duty cycle and weight were critical acme has produced in excess of  units  acme utilizes cylindrical nicad technology for our amps supplies  watts for  minutes the amps supplies  watts for  minutes and the amps is  watts for  minutes we also offer our ampsxl which utilizes a cylindrical sealed lead acid technology with the same specifications as our amps proprietary designs   acme aerospace will provide all drawings specifications and process descriptions required for customer qualification of acme aerospace designs  acmes present quality procedures will ensure any documentation submitted for qualification andor process evaluation shall be adequate for customer’s evaluation and for acme aerospace’s production needs  acme aerospace may require that the customer for some proprietary design documentation release approve a nondisclosure statement  acme aerospace will correct any and all workmanship andor design deficiencies found during the qualification  all drawings and specifications effected by such changes shall be completed prior to production hardware build   this procedure is managed by the use of internal design reviews  however by our use of design of experiments during the prototype phase minimal changes should be required as a result of qualification  acme aerospace shall conduct complete first article inspection of all purchased and manufactured parts for qualification units per quality procedure “first article inspectionprocured”     test equipment power systems you can
