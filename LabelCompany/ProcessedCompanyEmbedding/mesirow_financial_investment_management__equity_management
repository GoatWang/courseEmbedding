team to provide superior results our team competitive advantages alignment of interests we are an employee owned enterprise that is deeply committed to providing outstanding service and exceeding our clients’ expectations all of the investment team members are invested in our small cap value strategy our success is closely aligned with our clients’ success disciplined investment process we employ the same investment process for both our strategies our buy discipline leads us to purchase attractively valued higher quality stocks our clearly defined sell discipline ensures that we only own stocks where we have high conviction both our buy and sell disciplines help us to actively manage and mitigate risk in the portfolio holistic thought process a key differentiator is our use of top down macroeconomic analysis to identify trends that will likely provide tailwinds to stocks that have exposure to specific end markets the use of a top down overlay in a small cap strategy is very uncommon we believe it helps us identify better opportunities with a greater chance of investment success institutional stability our strategies are most appropriate for longterm institutional investors who prefer returns that are materially better than the market with substantially less risk than the market we also appeal to investors who prefer or need to have greater capital preservation in down markets due to expected nonprofit spending policies or retirement benefit payments unique perspective small cap perspectives our perspective on the small cap market is distinct because we
