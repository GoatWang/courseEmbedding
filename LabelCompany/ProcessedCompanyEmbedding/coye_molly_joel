photo chris hardy spotlight  molly joel coye bringing hospitals the latest technology    back to gallery dr molly joel coye has the tough task of keeping hospitals abreast of the latest technological advances even though many are struggling to make ends meet despite the financial and logistical strains on many hospitals and their staffs coye chief executive of san franciscos health technology center a nonprofit medical technology assessment group believes what the latest technology has to offer can play a decisive role in improving health care were one of the few resources out there to help delivery systems plan and identify whats out there in the pipeline she said adding that her group evaluates technologies but does not focus on prices and does not advise individual hospitals what to do latest business videos whats out there is a range of diseaseoriented and computerized technologies  from inhalers that will replace injections to monitors that fit in a vest a patient can wear many are surprisingly straightforward and based on existing technologies such as wireless locators that can help hospital staff find each other within the hospital others such as implantable devices to support various organs may take longer to test and adopt even in the worst of times hospitals have to keep investing in technology because its a part of their mission and its what their physicians expect were trying to help them make the best decisions they can make coye said from her office in the south of market coye founded the center which is known as healthtech in  healthtech has  employees and is funded by  member organizations including kaiser permanente and wellpoint health networks inc coyes career which she jokingly referred to as checkered hasnt been exclusively in technology but she has always been interested in searching for solutions to prevent problems and medical mistakes before they occur coye a wisconsin native who received both her medical degree and masters in public health from johns hopkins university left san francisco general hospital after practicing just five years in family and occupational medicine because she wanted to focus on preventing rather than just treating diseases among her many positions she headed the state health departments in both new jersey and california served as executive vice president at the good samaritan health system in the santa clara valley and was the product development director for healthdesk corp a berkeley company that developed interactive health and diseasemanagement software for consumers as a member of the institute of medicine coye was also behind two highly publicized reports that shook up the medical establishment the first in  reported that as many as  americans a year die from preventable medical errors a followup report in  found that it took an average of  years for new research knowledge to become incorporated into standard practice coye gives hospitals and the medical community credit for owning up to some of the problems identified in the report and trying to address them wanda jones president of the new century health care institute in san francisco commended coye for her efforts but thinks she has her work cut out for her while some hospitals are on solid financial footing jones said many are still shellshocked from the drop in revenue they experienced because of managedcare contracts in the s its like going through a war you dont forget she said they hospitals are fearful of spending money on anything optional and they consider new technologies as optional but coye said many new technologies actually save money by improving efficiencies or by detecting health problems before they wind up costing even more coye said shes seeing exciting improvements in remote internetbased management of intensivecare units or icus because of a current shortage in intensivecare specialists she said the technology which is already used in some hospitals throughout the country allows an offsite specialist to see and know everything that is going on in that icu through remote feeds and to advise the medical staff accordingly one local hospital system currently using such a system is sutter health which has been a healthtech member since the groups inception in january sutter started using remote intensivecare monitoring in two of its  hospitals sutter memorial and sutter general in sacramento and plans to expand its use according to sutters chief medical officer dr gordon hunt hunt said healthtech has been particularly helpful in helping sutter develop its system to archive digital radiological images in addition sutter expects to spend as much as  billion over the next  years to build new hospitals and outpatient clinics and relies on healthtech to help answer some important design questions what will the hospital of the future look like what will the operating room look like how will technologies of the future affect how we deliver care hunt asked explaining that the construction is necessary for expansion as well as meeting seismic upgrading requirements healthtech is working on these issues three or five or even  years on the horizon that you really need to address hunt said robert merwin chief executive of millspeninsula health services said healthtech has been helpful in designing the replacement for the peninsula medical center in burlingame construction will begin in  for example merwin said such design features as a larger operating room have been incorporated to accommodate the robotic surgical systems that healthtech believes will be a key part of the operating room of the future coye said with advancements in socalled keyhole or minimally invasive surgeries an increasing number of surgical procedures will be done in an outpatient setting doctors will be able to train for the procedures using computers the way pilots train with flight simulators in terms of medical device advancements coye said inhaled insulin for diabetics will be available in the next couple of years within five years she said dialysis will be used for people with liver disease dr molly joel coye age  job founder
