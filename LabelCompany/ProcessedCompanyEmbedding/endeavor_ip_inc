otcmktsenip  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»a  million company worth  endeavor ip incnov  about endeavor ip enip penny stock realist short onlypenny stock realistendeavor ip inc otcqbenip is a name that i believe is currently the target of a pennystock promotion scheme it is my view that the stocks intrinsic value is somewhere near  and it is with conviction that i recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately i also believe that endeavor ip inc is a stock definitely worth shorting my track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent ticker date of publication price at publication following low percent drop clnopk june      loteob april     did hit  in an incredible short squeeze  gninob july      cnctob feb      company background endeavor ip inc is an intellectual property services and patent licensing company that is engaged in the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property endeavor is based in half moon bay cahttpwwwenipcom little revenue debts bright future as is usually the case with these types of hyped up scams it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the m market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous with k in unaudited revenues in the most recent quarter and  in cash on hand net loss of  in recent quarter is clear they are not going in the right direction they really cant keep operating like they are and it is my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock the recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers being delivered to peoples homes endeavor ip inc follows the typical pattern most shells do that end up getting promoted  business taken public with no revenues  seed shareholders given shares for next to nothing  change in control  name and symbol change  forward split while all the shares were insider owned lets focus on whats important if you go through it all you come to a final share count reads as follows authorized  shares outstanding  shares cameron gray  shares solud solar energy inc  shares seed shareholders  free trading shares at  per share the most important thing are those nearly  million free trading shares most companies that end up being promoted usually tend to have little to no trading history endeavor ip inc is the same those seed shareholders cannot turn their shares into cash unless there are buyers this is where they turn to stock promoters stock promoters get paid to send out overly bullish professional type mailersemails to retail investors to lure them in let me show you what i mean picture of enip chart you can see that trading in endeavor ip inc really started on october   michael goode blogged about a endeavor ip inc landing page that went up on the same exact date coincidence absolutely not compensation a one million dollar investor relations budget is being managed by c america marketing you can see obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for endeavor ip inc most likely those seed shareholders with about  million free trading shares who knows who owns what why else would someone spend  to increase public awareness it is worth it to them because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices that can mean about  million in profits running pump and dump schemes is a lucrative business and that is why we see it way to often my job is to wake you up this is not the first financier times first promotion either promoter history stock promotion high low since percentage drop nhur    sanb    enip    nhurnorthumberland resources inc disclosed budget  shares outstanding  promotion high  market capitalization at high  million percent drop  sanb sanborn resources ltd disclosed budget  shares outstanding  promotion high  market capitalization at high  percent drop  enip endeavor ip inc disclosed budget  shares outstanding  promotion high  market capitalization at high  percent drop  email promotions if you sign up to billionairestocks you will notice they promote the same stocks as the financier times i believe its the same people i have not received enip emails from them yet but they tend to start sending emails mid way through the promotion so be on the look out for that you can see the emails i have received from them below sanb email disclaimer nhur email disclaimer i believe they will promote endeavor ip inc next my recommendation i believe endeavor ip inc will act like the past two financier times stock promotions if you own shares of this company get out now do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool these shares are worthless i have showed you that the reason for the promotional mailers indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse if you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares then i believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you remember i warned you good luck i contacted them through their contact page i have yet to receive a response regarding my concerns that endeavor ip inc may have been set up purporsely to sell stock to enrich a few people
