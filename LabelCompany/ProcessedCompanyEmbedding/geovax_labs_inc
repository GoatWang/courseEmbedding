the cells of the person receiving the vaccine producing vlps in the person being vaccinated mimics a natural infection stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system to recognize prevent and control the target infection should it appear our current development programs are focused on vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus hiv hemorrhagic fever viruses such as ebola zaire sudan marburg and lassa malaria and zika virus we have also initiated programs to develop a vaccine to treat chronic hepatitis b hbv infection and to apply our mvavlp vector technology to cancer immunotherapy immunooncology we believe our technology and vaccine development expertise is wellsuited for a wide variety of human diseases for which there is an unmet medical need and we intend to pursue expansion of our product pipeline our hemorrhagic fever vaccine program was initiated during  in response to the ebola epidemic in western africa and with the goal of developing second generation monovalent and multivalent vaccines capable of preventing or containing future outbreaks of major hemorrhagic fever viruses indigenous to africa our initial preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates for our first vaccine candidate ebolazaire virus have shown  protection against death after a single dose our most advanced vaccines under development are designed to function against the clade b subtype of the hiv virus that is prevalent in the americas and western europe our preventive clade b hiv vaccine has successfully completed phase a human clinical testing has entered a followon clinical trial in  our clade b vaccine has shown outstanding safety and excellent highly reproducible immunogenicity we are extending our hiv vaccine effort to the most common virus subtype affecting the developing world clade c we also are investigating our hiv vaccines for their potential to contribute to combination therapies leading to a cure for hiv infections our vaccine technology was developed in collaboration with researchers at emory university the nih and the cdc the technology is exclusively licensed to us from emory university we also have nonexclusive licenses to certain patents owned by the nih our hemorrhagic fever vaccines have been developed with technology licensed from and in collaboration with the nih our immunooncology program is being developed pursuant to a research collaboration with the university of pittsburgh our zika vaccine program is in collaboration with the cdc our hbv therapeutic program is in collaboration with georgia state university and our malaria vaccine is being developed in collaboration with burnet institute in australia our vaccine development activities have been and continue to be financially supported by the us government this support has been both in the form of research grants awarded directly to us in kind support in terms of animal experiments as well as indirect support for the conduct of our human

genetic material comprised of dna or ribonucleic acid “rna” surrounded by a protein lipid fat or glycoprotein coat viruses invade healthy living host cells in order to replicate and spread in many cases the body’s immune system can recognize and effectively combat an infection caused by a virus however with certain viral infections the body’s immune system is unable to fully destroy or inhibit the replication of the virus which results in persistent and ongoing viral replication resulting in disease infections caused by viruses can be chronic or acute chronic infections such as those caused by hiv do not typically selfresolve with time and can cause chronic disease acute infections associated with viruses such as influenza generally last for a relatively short period of time and selfresolve in most immunocompetent individuals viruses can also be characterized as either active or latent an active virus can cause a persistent infection or disease over an extended period of time a latent virus will remain in the body for very long periods of time after the initial infection and generally will only cause disease when the body’s immune system weakens fails or is suppressed allowing the virus to once again replicate vaccines have been widely used to prevent active viral infections from occurring viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs are increasingly becoming a challenge in the treatment of viral infections particularly those that are chronic in nature the ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication allows drugresistant strains to emerge when patients are using drugs that are not potent enough to quickly and completely inhibit viral replication drug resistance occurs because viruses continually replicate making millions of copies of themselves some of which contain mutations in their genetic material mutations that emerge in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to mutant strains that are wholly or partially resistant to that drug these mutant viruses while initially low in number eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient as those strains that remain susceptible to the drug are inhibited from replicating once this occurs the treatment benefit of that particular antiviral drug often diminishes resulting in treatment failure and the need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs or classes of drugs in general viruses that cause chronic infections such as hiv are more likely to develop drug resistance due to the longterm and persistent exposure of the virus to the antiviral therapy   resourceswhat are viruseswhat are vaccinesoverview of hivaidsoverview of ebola and marburghelpful linksglossary of terms hiv aids vaccine research geovax  publications
