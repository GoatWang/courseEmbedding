about kingstone companies kins looking for diogenes biotech midcap research analyst dividend investingsummaryi share the extensive history of this companyi share the vision of the new leadership teami share the strengths and limitations that investors face in investing in their stock in october of  the statue of liberty sitting at the entrance to new york citys harbor was unveiled to the us citizenry that was  years ago if an investor believes that comparable durability longevity plus a sustainable business model has credence for ones investing dollars i just might have the company for your consideration in the same year  in a small bucolic village about  miles north of new york city a company was formed that still survives and thrives to this day the original name of the company was the commercial mutual insurance company the company is now called kingstone companies inc nasdaqkins the company was founded in kingston new york where it sits on the western side of the hudson river in the hudson valley the above picture gives you the modern day version of the place where kingstone was created being far from the congestion of new york city and the daily influence of decision making being dominated by wall street machination has its advantages a place like kingston where high prices dont erode revenues from being available for spending on building a sustainable company makes it an ideal place for nurturing a company kingstone offers property and casualty insurance products mainly to small businesses and individual clients their product lineup includes personal insurance for homeowners dwelling fire multiplex and condominium family dwellings renters equipment and service line endorsements and personal umbrella policies they also offer commercial liability insurance for owners that have no residential exposure for where the insurance applies kingston also writes physical damage coverage on forhirevehicles and car service vehicles this means that they have coverage for the growing car service businesses like uber and lyft and last but not least they offer policies for canine liability for those dogs that like to bite some thing or some one history of the company excalibur sword in the stone symbolizes the legacy of arthur maybe the same image can symbolize the legacy of kingstone created in  as the commercial mutual insurance companycmic their area of marketing was limited to the general area around kingston in  kingstone purchased the controlling interest cmic with new management in place they opted to under go demutualization from the companys original chart in  and renamed it kingston insurance company later they changed the holding company into kingstone companies inc at this time the new management had put in place their plans to expand their area of doing business in  they gained approval from the state of pennsylvania for them to do business in their state also in  they issued their first dividend of  a share in  they had an ipo that raised net proceeds of  million with the stock being issued at a price of  the premier rating agency am best in  assigned knis their beginning rating of b subsequently it was raised to b in  recently best lifted their rating to b they arent at the desired a rating as of yet however they are rapidly moving toward that goal the rating increases are reflective of the recognition for the growing financial fundamentals of kingstones operations with their growth plan in place they have extended their marketing area currently they have clearance to market their coverage in new york new jersey connecticut pennsylvania and texas they have a pending clearance in one more state imo the spreading of risk over a more diverse area is essential for sound growth and a more balanced underwriting of risk exposures creating shareholder value               financial metrics           gross premium growth           book value per share           dividend per share           from these key metrics one can see that gross premiums have shown excellent growth over the last four years this growth has continued in  through the rd q  premium growth has been  however it should be noted this is based on one line of business underwriting being systematically eliminated from their insurance offerings this is being done by not renewing existing policies in the area of commercial auto coverage more on this later the book value has also increased in a constantly growing pattern where it now stands at  per share ytd  its also nice to see that by owning this stock one can participate in yearly increases in dividends being paid currently and with the dividend being paid this month the annual rate is  per share at the time this article is being written the shares area trading at the  level at this point the dividend results in a return of about  on your capital investment key financial metrics period ending sep jun mar dec   total

it should be noted this is based on one line of business underwriting been systematically eliminated from their insurance offerings this is being done by not renewing existing policies in the area of commercial auto coverage more on this later i might also point out at the end of the rd q  kingstones policies in force had grown by  yearoveryear currently  of this growth is coming from downstate new york which includes nyc and long island the good news is that kingstone has undertaken a major effort for expanding their national area of coverage beyond the tight historical boundaries where the concentration had been the aforementioned downstate new york area i will add more to this expansion undertaking later in the article as one can note since the end of  the quarterly results reflect a nice double digit growth in total revenues i think it safe to assume that the current quarter will replicate a continuation of this growth one might observe from this data the st quarter is the quarter that reflects the smallest net income result this should be expected as its this quarter where insurance company should see the greatest amount of claims due to the winter months having a major impact on dwellings considering that historically kingstone has the majority of their insurance coverage in a small geographic area that has extreme weather conditions during this period such results should be the norm with the current expansion with the proper underwriting in place this could be abated going forward where premium income and claims can be spread over different weather and climate conditions also from this data its highly noticeable that since the end of  the rd quarter result reflects an excellent  growth in net income if the current th quarter merely repeats the rd quarters net income level then for the full year  we would see net income coming in at  million based on the outstanding shares being only  million this would create a net income of just over a  per

are many takeaways from this data set the first being the current trailing pe is  where the forward pe fye  is  with this projected earnings growth it shouldnt be out of the realm during  where we could have the current pe growing by  this is supported by the current book value per share being  with just a x book the share price would be at  or  above the current price this is all predicated on revenues and earnings continuing on the current trend another key component of the kingstone story is the fact that they have no outstanding long term debt on their books as mentioned there is great merit in having the company domiciled in the hudson valley as opposed to a large city where real estate prices and employee cost being well above the norm mentioning employees kingstone has in place an employee profit sharing plan so there is a great incentive for employees being dedicated to their workplace and company objectives kingstone owns their office building and with planned growth they have room for expansion key issues for consideration with only a few years under new leadership kingstone has made great strides in redirecting the company into a boarder based insurance underwriter new leadership has grown revenues and profits reflecting double digit growth in these critical areas operating efficiency has improved each year since  and its on track for  reflecting further improvement in this key metric company is located in an area where it provides lowercost employment company has ownership of their operational facilities thus reducing cost of doing business plus they have space for future expansion needs employees have profit sharing program enhancing their incentive for doing a good job plus holds down expense of replacing employees and incurring related expenses since september  kingstone has grown their book value from  to the current  valuation this represents a  increase over same period of time they have grown the quarterly dividend from  to current  rate this represents a  growth rate experienced management team with interest tied to shareholders directors and senior management own approximately  of shares outstanding for a small insurance underwriter it is key that they dont have exposure to a single catastrophe they could undermine financial capabilities for meeting claim obligations as of july   they have in place new agreements for reinsurance that provides better downside protection for any major adverse events from a limited geographic location where they did underwriting the company has now started an expansion effort that currently involves five states with approval currently pending for another state key issues of concern kingstone currently is sporting a market cap that is under  million over recent years with the new management they have shown remarkable results in key financial metrics recent results must be followed with the same diligence and operational execution the expanded scope of their market is key but must be planned and implemented with strict due diligence for sound underwriting of their policies and policy holders the original geographic area of down state new york where most of their clients lived has experience several major storms that impacted insurance companies the recent storm called sandy is a prime example even the major insurance companies have undergone strict limitations on the areas where they will offer coverage with exposure to massive storms with new coverage being written now in texas the same issues exist major companies will not offer homeowner coverage in the coastal counties subject to gulf of mexico storms keystone has to be diligent with their underwriting for such areas it wouldnt be prudent for kingstone or any other carrier to step in just because there are homeowners who cant get coverage from the former carriers in these areas continued growth is essential but prudent growth is more essential with kingstones recent decision to phase out commercial auto coverage this was a wise decision being made people who drive company vehicles arent as careful with their driving habits as compared with the actual owners who are making monthly car payments with that said expanding their offerings is critical since they are using a direct sales forces of independent agents to market their insurance programs so more options for their key agents is critical for growth but do the building of such offerings with diligent consideration kingstone only has  million shares in the float this presents a liquidity problem for buying and selling the stock any orders to purchase the stock should be done with strict limits on your bid price always be mindful limited shares works as a positive for the upside however also as a negative if this requires one attempting to sell their position this is not a stock for your grandmothers account and not one for mortgaging your farm it is my opinion that this is a stock with the potential to return a nice capital gain while offering a decent return with their dividend policy my perspective is based on a longterm outlook for the stock any market contraction can and will impact companies like kingstone however if the fundamentals stay in tact maybe our great grandkids will be thankful for our investing in the stock in  where then they might be able to review a history of more than three centuries showing continued growth as seen now for a more indepth look at kingstones financials i would suggest you visit their website and review the comprehensive investor presentation they made back in november good luck with

additional memory speed up my computer additional memory will not necessarily increase the performance of your computer it will allow you to run more programs or processes at once or more memory

by kingston faq ktmgen close what is the difference between the part numbers that are in dual or triple channel kits and the parts that sold individually parts sold in kits denoted by k or kin the part number eg – kvrxcakg are specifically packaged for use in dual or triple channel motherboards although dual and triple channel technology resides on the motherboard itself inside the chipset the memory modules need to be installed in pairs or sets of three for dual or triple channel mode to function properly identical modules packaged in a kit work best because the motherboard will be accessing all the memory modules as a single memory location with a wider bandwidth kingston suggests the use ofmodules sold in kits for dual or triple channel enabled motherboards faq ktmgen close will a faster memory of the same type run at a slower speed ie mhz ddr in a mhz ddr system yes in most cases if the computer supports a slower speed it will clock down to a slower speed as long as it is the correct memory type ddr ddr etc but be aware the function of clocking down depends on the computer and it isnt guaranteed to work in every case faq ktmgen close my bios or a diagnostic program such as cpuz shows the memory is running at half the frequency why in many cases the bios or a diagnostic program will report the memory bus frequency which is half of the frequency for ddr type memory as its name implies ddr double data rate data rate is twice the memory bus frequency so if the memory bus speed is mhz and you are using ddr memory the ram is running at the correct speed faq ktmgen close what is esd electrostatic discharge esd is simply the discharge of built up static electricityesd should not be taken lightly as this is one of the few things an individual can do to damage or destroy their computer or hardware componentsit is like when you rub your feet on the carpet and you touch something metalesd can occur without the user feeling a shock and will occur when only working on the inside of the computer or handling hardware how to help prevent esd the best method of preventing esd is to use an esd wrist strap or a grounding mat or tablehowever because most users do not have access to these items we have included the below steps to help reduce the chance of esd as much as possible standing – we recommend that you are standing at all times when working on the computer setting on a chair can generate more electrostatic cords  make sure everything is removed from the back of the computer power cord mouse keyboard etc clothes  make sure not to wear any clothing that conducts a lot of electrical charge such as a wool sweater accessories  to help reduce esd and help prevent other problem it is also a good idea to remove all jewelry weather  electrical storms can increase the esd risk unless absolutely necessary try not to work on a computer during an electrical stormin very dry areas the air itself becomes a part of the electrostatic buildup mechanism every time there is an air flow wind air conditioning blower passing over an insulated surfacedo not let high humidity levels build a false confidence and beware of corrosion problems with interconnects and other electrical interfaces to learn more about esd and how to protect your electronics please refer to the below site esd association httpwwwesdaorgaboutesdhtml faq ktcgenesd close
