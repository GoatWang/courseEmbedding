secretary for budget carolyn gleason air force deputy director for budget may   print  email staff ladies and gentlemen im captain hope cronin air force public affairs thank you for being here today with us well begin our briefing in just a moment first just to reiterate ground rules one question one followup please so we can get through as many questions as possible additionally ill give a final question towards the end as a reminder tomorrow at  in the morning well have the air force space budget rollout it is a separate budget rollout if youd like more information about that please find me afterwards and ill give you further details without any further ado ladies and gentleman general martin and ms gleason major general james f martin jr great good afternoon everyone im major general jim martin air force director of budget and im joined by my deputy ms carolyn gleason so we appreciate the opportunity to provide highlights of our fy  budget next slide let me get right to the message and start with the bottom line up front i think what youll see in this budget that our message and our budget is consistent with what weve done over the last two years for the last  years though american airmen have always been there breaking barriers dominating the high ground and providing unmatched global vigilance reach and power as part of the worlds greatest joint warfighting team the unique capabilities that we bring are foundational to the joint force and our nation but  years of continuous combat operations and budget uncertainty have taken their toll since  the world has changed and it continues to remain very unstable today air force capabilities are in high demand and that demand will only continue to grow to meet the demands now and in the future we believe our fy  budget request sets the conditions to improve readiness field critical capability gaps and build future lethality but it will take time and it will take additional resources to be successful we will need an increase over bca caps as well as predictable sufficient and flexible budgets so we can recover readiness and build a more capable and lethal force for the future next slide as always we work hard to make every dollar count so we use a very deliberate process to link resources with strategic guidance combatant commander expectations and the requirements of the joint force our fy request is based on guidance from the secretary of defense and his commitment to strengthen our joint team by improving war fighter readiness addressing critical shortfalls while building a larger more capable and more lethal force our budget request follows that guidance and puts priority on investing in airmen readiness combat air forces nuclear deterrents space and cyber capabilities as well as infrastructure  all critical components for the joint force and the security of our nation next slide getting this right is important because air force capabilities are critical to the joint force our challenge in a fiscally constrained environment is to maintain balance across all five core missions as i said american airmen active guard reserve and civilians are always there dominating the high ground leading and flawlessly executing our five core missions we are americans  force able to deliver full spectrum effects anywhere on the globe in a matter of hours we ensure freedom from attack and the ability to attack at a time and place of our choosing and the ability to operate freely in both peace time and war time we are the eyes and ears of the joint force we provide secure survivable and timely command and control capabilities over multiple domains while at the same time protecting the homeland and ensuring a strong nuclear deterrence to meet current and future demands we must invest in capabilities to fight and win today but also the capabilities needed to fight and win     years from now next slide on the last slide you saw a number of platforms but its our people that make us the worlds greatest air force behind every one of those weapons systems are airmen who support and develop maintain and operate those platforms delivering the unique capabilities that we provide to the joint force our airmen remain engaged   days a year at home and abroad as we speak more than  airmen stand watch in deployed locations around the world all the while thousands of airmen protect the homeland fight from home station and stand alert  supporting two legs of our nations nuclear triad what you see on this slide are highlights of what are airmen are do  what our airmen bring to the fight they are foundational to successful joint operations around the world they are always there at the beginning the middle and the end of every operation theyre doing great things for our nation in very tough conditions so its our moral obligation to ensure all airmen we send into harms way are properly trained equipped and led so they can be successful as part of the joint team to help we are working to revitalize squadrons across the air force its the most essential level of command where readiness is generated and sustained where airmen and families thrive and where the missions of the air force succeed next slide americas air force is still great but  years of continuous combat operations have taken their toll however americas expectations of our air force are still shaped by the incredible success of operation desert storm but the reality is we are not the same air force we were back then back then we had  combatcoded fighter squadrons today we have  today we have  percent fewer people  percent fewer aircraft and the average age of our aircraft is  years and our readiness level remains challenged at a time when were busier in our history all of this while the world remains unstable and the demand for air force capabilities continues to grow since august  the air force has led the global response against violent extremist organizations and we remain heavily engaged in afghanistan were facing a resurgent russia a rising china an unpredictable north korea and multiple hot spots around the globe the capability gap is closing fast advanced air defenses and radars are becoming more common and competitors continue to invest in new technology in their own fifthgeneration aircraft space and cyber domains are becoming more congested and contested and what weve learned is that future conflicts and contentions will be transregional multifunctional multidomain and will require fast action by joint and coalition forces our joint team our allies and our nation expect the air force to respond quickly with overwhelming force to dominate the high ground throughout every phase of every conflict next slide this chart illustrates some of the challenges i described on a previous chart and the budget uncertainty we have faced over the last five years that budget uncertainty sequestration and operating at lessthanplanned budget levels have forced us to make tough choices which resulted in lost capability lost capacity and reduced readiness at the same time the world changed in  and continues to remain unstable and more complex all driving increased demand and mission growth in isr space and cyber so we are grateful for the modest shortterm relief provided by congress in the last bipartisan budget act and the passage of the fy  appropriation which addressed many of our critical shortfalls looking ahead to fy  we believe our request sets the foundation to improve readiness and invest in capabilities needed for the future however fy  is a pivotal year because the budget control act and sequestration remain the law without relief in bca caps it will drive a choice between ready and capable now or ready and capable in the future its a false choice because we need both to be successful next slide this slide highlights those choices what we can do if the fy  budget is supported versus what could happen if we were forced to absorb large reductions as you can see in the green box the fy  budget request allows us to sustain capacity to support combatant commanders most urgent requirements it funds readiness components to support readiness recovery and invests in our people by filling critical capability gaps and providing additional pay and entitlements it allows us to fund munitions to capacity to support current ops and improve inventory requirements it will strengthen our nuclear enterprise and advance investments in space and cyber we can invest in our top recapitalization programs and maintain airlift capacity for worldwide demand finally we can invest in infrastructure for new mission beddowns training and readiness as we train and operate from bases at home and abroad however if the air force has to absorb large reductions impacts to readiness future modernization infrastructure and people cannot be avoided thats where the money is and those are the accounts that you can dialdown quickly to pay the bill we would have to consider all options such as reducing force structure delaying even more modernization programs shortchanging readiness accounts and delaying investments in our strategic assets such as nuclear space isr and cyber infrastructure would continue to suffer as we would be forced to take risk an action weve repeated since fy  sequestration and worst of all it would impact people both their quality of life and their quality of service the bottom line all these choices are bad we simply cant afford the risk of returning to bca so we need predictable stable budgets with sufficient funding so we can plan for the air force that we need now and in the future next slide now lets take a look at the highlights of our fy  budget for comparison the bar on the left is our fy  enacted budget the bar on the right is our fy  budget request it represents our total force budget to include active duty guard and reserve components the top block is what we refer to as nonblue which is the portion of the air force budget that is managed by other departments or agencies the remainder of the budget or the air force blue budget baseline is the focus for todays brief in the brackets youll see the air force budget for fy  is approximately  billion which is roughly  percent of dods fy  budget of the  billion approximately  billion or  percent supports daytoday operations military and civilian pay make up  percent of the daytoday operating costs flying hours weapons system sustainment and missions executed at our major commands total  percent of the funding facility requirements and installation support represent the remaining  percent of the total operating costs the blue and the gray boxes at the bottom summarize our top procurement and largest rdte programs these programs total approximately  billion or about  percent of our investment accounts so ill go back to what i said on the previous slide so you can see that the largest portions of our budget are in people readiness and modernization so when forced to take large reductions we simply cannot avoid impacts in these areas now well look at each appropriation starting with military personnel the air forces number one priority remains people growing endstrength is crucial for readiness recovery and readiness depends on the contributions of the total force active guard and reserve our request grows total force endstrength to approximately  a total force increase of  from fy  it increases the active duty force by  with an increase of  for the guard and reserve this budget begins to address the pilot shortage by adding training capacity in our formal training units while also ingesting our incentive pay structure it will provide the personnel to support two new f flying training units and other initiatives to increase pilot production and training we will increase pilot retention bonuses from  to  per year the first increase since  this budget will allow us to continue our progress in tackling maintenance manpower shortfalls while also addressing critical capability gaps in critical career fields such as nuclear cyber and the rpa enterprise to help with the retention we will continue to offer incentive pays and bonuses to encourage experienced airmen to stay we will also continue higher tenure extensions for personnel in key career fields to further retain experience additionally this budget allows us to add  recruiters and personnel to rightsize the training pipeline to support over  enlisted accessions furthermore with our chief priority to revitalize our squadrons this budget also adds over  commander support staff personnel to ease the burden of additional duties which allows airmen to focus on their core mission finally the fy  budget requests a  pay raise for our airmen while also funding the new blended retirement system which will be effective  january  next slide the fy  operational maintenance budget prioritizes readiness recovery and provides funding for vital support to our airmen and their families the om request fully supports the air force top priority to grow total force of military and strength by funding recruiting infrastructure and training efforts aimed at addressing critical shortfalls discussed on the previous slide as we have said over the last few years readiness recovery is not a shortterm fix it will take years to fully rebuild to keep us on the path to readiness recovery we will continue funding flying hours to executable levels and weapons system sustainment to mirror capacity we also continue to invest in ranges simulators and critical skills training such as combat flag exercises and advanced weapons tools to go along with the manpower the requests funds om requirements for two additional f training squadrons at holloman air force base last year we began an effort to freeup skilled maintainers to transition to the f fleet by contracting maintenance support at some of our active duty training units this budget continues that effort this budget also support  rpa combat lines with a surge capability of an additional  governmentowned contractoroperated combat lines funded with oco this request fully funds cyber mission teams in fy  we are ontrack to grow from  to  operational teams well continue to fund icbm sustainment key nc upgrades and continue our commitment to advance space capabilities it helps fix aging infrastructure by funding facility sustainment at  percent and restoration and modernization repair at  percent for the plant replacement value this budget also takes care of our airmen and their families we improve a number of quality of life military family programs increase personnel at our family support centers and fund  civilian positions on the command support staff to support the chief of staff priority to reinvigorate squadrons complementing the  military funded in the milpers appropriation this budget also funds  dedicated sexual assault prevention and response personnel finally this budget supports a  percent pay raise for our civilian airmen next slide our  our fy  procurement budget preserves our top modernization programs sustains our space procurement strategy invests in the nuclear enterprise and funds munitions to capacity this budget procures  fs  kcs and five mcjs and two acjs while also continuing modernization efforts for our fourth and fifth generation aircraft for munitions as weve discussed we remain challenged by the pace of current operations therefore for preferred munitions such as jdam sdbi and hellfire we will fund to capacity between base and oco and begin to replenish our inventories for readiness improvements well invest in upgrading and expanding combat training range capabilities we also provide funding for battlefield airmen so they will have the equipment they need to remain agile and lethal as space becomes more congested and contested the air force remains committed to advancing our capabilities to operate in that environment fy  is the last of the block buy for sbirsgeo  and  and well begin long lead procurement for sbirsgeo  and  this budget also supports our goal of maintaining the shared access to space with funding for three competitive launch opportunities so the next slide shows our major procurement quantities these are the planned procurement quantities for the budget which show both base and oco both aircraft and space procurement quantities remain fairly constant however based on current demand as we talked about on the previous slide well put emphasis on replenishing our weapons inventory continuing what we start in fy  again we are buying preferred munitions to capacity next slide for research development tests and evaluation appropriation you know the air force  you know innovation has always been at the core of the air force identity and its  its been a big part of our history so what rdte funding allows us to do is to take an idea to  to leap an idea to technology well use every day so just imagine our world without gps as i mentioned the capability gap is closing and we must continue to invest in gamechanging technology such as hypersonics directed energy unmanned autonomous systems and nanotechnology to ensure our nuclear forces remain capable and credible this request provides funding for future nuclear capabilities with significant increases to the longrange standoff weapon and the groundbased strategic deterrence in order to combat the cyber threat we are investing in an offensive and defensive initiatives to train and equip our cyber forces with capabilities that they need to defend the nation this request also funds our next generation bomber as the program progresses into detailed design the b raider will provide critical operational flexibility across a wide range of military options providing both conventional and nuclear capabilities this budget request also invests in the adaptive engine transition program a program that will deliver revolutionary nextgeneration propulsion systems for multiple combat aircraft applications finally our request increases operational systems development to upgrade fourth and fifthgen legacy aircraft such as the f next slide for our military construction we are focusing on new weapon system beddowns strengthening the nuclear enterprise and providing facilities for central training requirements this budget supports combatant commanders highest construction priorities and improves our posture of forces in europe and enhance asiapacific resiliency this slide highlights the major projects for active guard and reserve the overall air forces fy milcon budget represents a balanced approach to ensure critical infrastructure and requirements meet mission needs operational timelines and enhance our capability to respond globally to manmade  to manmade and natural threats so ready  ready and resilient installations are a critical part of  of air force operations we have said that infrastructure is a readiness issue and since fy we have deferred a number of current mission projects so with additional funding we could execute up to  million in new construction sic  million in new construction next slide  for the overseas contingency operations your air force is leading the fight against violent extremist organizations we have dropped over  munitions over  percent of the total mq and mq aircrews have flown more than  hours we fly an average of more than  sorties per day and participate in  percent of coalition airstrikes this years oco request is  billion and supports the efforts on the slide by funding flying hours weapon systems sustainment and daytoday operating costs for six enduring locations in the centcom aor in addition to the munitions buys included in our baseline budget request oco is requested to replace nearly  preferred munitions and lastly this request funds milcon airfield projects in africom sic centcom and supports the european reassurance initiative by investing in critical infrastructure such as airfields aircraft hangers and munitions storage facilities next slide  as i mentioned earlier the fy budget request sets the foundation to improve readiness fixed capability gaps and improve future lethality but as i mentioned the demand for air force capabilities continues to exceed available resources so this slide just highlights some of those areas where additional resources could be applied and illustrates the need for predictable sufficient and flexible budgets in the future next slide  so to conclude todays briefing here are the highlights that i want to leave you with for the past  years american airman are always there dominating the high ground delivering global vigilance reach and power but the demand for current and future airpower air and space power exceeds supply the air forces fy budget is our best attempt to apply limited resources to build a more capable and lethal force one that is ready today and one that is ready tomorrow as i said this will be a long term effort to be successful we will need relief from bca caps as well as predictable sufficient and flexible budgets the importance of airpower has not changed in the last  years and the demand for air and space power will continue to grow so we must be prepared to dominate the skies above the earth our airmen and our joint team deserve it and our nation expects it next slide so as always we provide you the website to our link that has all our budget projects our  our products to include the budget overview book this budget brief as well as all our detailed justification material so with that well open it up for questions tony  q quick one  couple quick ones the presidential aircraft program   million for rd what does that buy and is that a reduction from what was projected last year for  deputy director carolyn gleason so theres no content change in par it reflects the current acquisition strategy inaudible and  and the new requirements baseline  and its based  its informed by boeings risk reduction activity so its basically a change in a cost estimate and reflects the same content q off mic looked back at last year versus  it  it would be a higher number and ms gleason thats correct q this reflects a more refined estimate ms gleason its a rephrasing yes and youll see that a couple of places so one thing the air force does is every time we get new cost estimates we lay that into our budget we review our  correct  we review our investment programs continually through the year but really in support of the big budget activities and so youll see that in a couple of our programs q off mic theres a little footnote there that said youre moving like a billion dollars of rd  om money to rd to pay for  employees whats that about and doesnt that take away  billion for rd programs gen martin no its  well no its really budget neutral all were doing is moving about  employees that do  that do rdte work acquisition professionals from  from the om account into that appropriation ms gleason it was just a realignment gen martin just a realignment ms gleason its really getting our entire acquisition workforce together because our  our folks out at space and missile center and our folks in the f were already paid out of the rd account the remainder of our acquisition core was in om so it was disjointed this gives us some flexibility it aligns them better with the work that they perform which does crosstalk q off mic gen martin no ms gleason were not  no  no  no it was a realignment the money moved with the people gen martin no right q oh the money moved with the people ms gleason the money moved with the people gen martin yes because youll see on the om slide theres a  theres a decrease that  in rtde theres an increase ms gleason its a plus gen martin  for the same amount yes you bet so lets go with you  q yes courtney albon with inside the air force theres a  a significant increase in b rtde is that  is that just a shifting of funds that were reduced or shifted in the past or is that actually a ramp up in development ms gleason so b from the  budget to the  budget theres not much change its just a natural progression of the program from  enacted to  its moving into detailed design there was a plan to ramp up in the programs its fully funded and progressing like we would expect it to q can you also address the increase in next generation air dominance funding theres a significant growth there and what that funding will – will do gen martin yeah that funds a study and analysis to really look at how we get after future threats so looking at capabilities that we need that well know again well into the future in some form by air forces  superiority study that were doing and again it goes back to what we said earlier we have to be ready for not only what we need today but we better be ready for the potential threats you know   years from now because we know the capability gap is closing so this allows us to go out and think of new ways of doing business and again i go back to the gps example you know just imagine a world without gps we need to invest in technology that when it shows up people go ‘whered that come from’ and thats what were trying to do q off mic two quick questions so in the document that was sent out there is a mention that the fs needs a slep of specifically for the fuselage longerons but i am  the language is a little bit unclear im wondering if that means that you committed to doing that slep or youre just sort of noting that the need is in there and then my second question is theres also a line that says youre extending the service life of the u does that mean youre keeping it past  when is the  the  the new retirement date now gen martin yes so i think you know again getting back to our messages that you know the world has changed so were trying to maintain capacity and capability so were dedicated just to making sure that the f fleet remains viable and survivable and capable you know in this new environment and regarding the u we plan to keep that platform well into the future q so what  so what  i mean previously youve given a hard retirement date when is  is there not a crosstalk gen martin there is not a  there is not a retirement date for the u in this budget q off mic for the foreseeable future gen martin for the foreseeable future thats correct because again thats a capability that we need and we also need the capacity as well q so why the change you were going to retire it and now youre not going to retire it gen martin well i think if you look back to fy  if you look at that chart that has all the you know the budget uncertainty that we were faced we were forced to pay a significant bill and if you remember back in fy  to pay a  billion bill we looked to draw down the force we took risk in munitions we looked at force structure reductions but that was in february of  when we submitted that budget well the world changed in august of  so we  in the  and  we requested a budget that we need to meet todays threat as well as try to maintain the balance for the future so it really gets back to maintaining capability and capacity that we need for the future q because they were going to replace it with the global hawk with upgraded sensors gen martin thats correct q so and that seemed to satisfy a lot of people is that  is it just that you have more money so you can keep both around longer or crosstalk gen martin right or  exactly with more resources we can keep both around and we  and we need both to meet the demand for isr yes q paul shinkman with us news and world report one of the biggest proportional changes in the entire dod oco budget was the air force and military construction budget can you talk about why the big change and where is that construction going to take place gen martin yes we can in fact lets get you the details exactly where that constructions going to take place but you know our overall budget for  youre talking about the european reassurance initiative right staff it wasnt specified q all right so that gen martin ok q is that where its  its going gen martin a portion of that is but theres other  theres other projects that are going around to support the enduring locations we have and i think i mentioned that were also investing in some air fields in africom too sic centcom but let us give you the detailed list of those projects after this briefing ms gleason we could just get details gen martin yes sir q steve losey the air force times the budget overview referred to the air force seeking to reduce the dwelldeploy ratio for  for airmen to increase training at home station can you provide anymore detail on what kind of dwelldeploy ratio youre looking at for  for what kind of airmen gen martin yes so were doing a number of initiatives to try to  and again our biggest issue is really the pilot shortage right now and the maintenance manpower shortfall so if we get after some of that thats going to increase the deploytodwell and give our folks time to train and theyll deploy but theyll also give them time to rest so were trying to rampup pilot production from about  to  per year we mentioned the two training units that were standing up were bringing in more maintainers were decreasing that shortfall which will provide more aircraft availability again looking at more opportunities to train we talk about the relief in the support staff in the squadrons which will allow pilots more time to train maintainers to be out on the flight line so all those things will help in that effort and its not just in  with the pilots and the maintainers but its in the rpa enterprise all those critical peripherals that have been stressed with that  with that problem were trying to get after all of that q unidentified speaker so the overall dod program acquisition costs by weapons system booklet indicated that the air force is buying two jltvs this year can you talk a little bit about why thats happening is that like a proof of concept or is the air force officially joining that program now ms gleason i will have to get you an answer i dont know the answer to that so well  well take it for the record q ok but if i could just have one other question so could i follow up to lara’s question about the f slep so is that something that if there is a fydp that we see will that be in the fydp or is that something that is planned to do gen martin so again i think you know i think that what youll see in our budget and in the long term is that we want to keep those aircraft viable so you know for example in this  in this budget there is approximately  million for f upgrades modifications you know were committed to that because again its a capacity and capability issue for us that we have right now q so is the slep funded gen martin yes ms gleason yes gen martin yes it is lets go in the back here q hey amy mccullough air force magazine the fy  budget funds eight less reapers than last years budget and general holmes has said that the air force actually needs  continues to see like  funded each year in order to maintain the fleet but fy  only has  so whats the reason for the decrease in funding there and is that enough to maintain what you need gen martin so lets get back to you on that ms gleason yeah ill have to gen martin well get back go you on that one but any type of you know any type of decrease in quantity really has to do with again making tough trades against balancing across those five core issues ok because if you go back to that slide the five core missions that we provide are critical to the joint force and we provide unique and many capabilities and so again trying to maintain that balance sometimes forces us into tough tradeoffs but let me give you a good answer to that question ok q last year the flying hour budget was funded at  percent and a big part of that was because the air force didnt have the maintainers to create the sorties needed to get to  percent so what is the executable level this year gen martin so again were funding flying hours to what we can execute and thats about  percent of the requirement and again every year as we address the pilot shortfall every year as we bring on more maintainers and as we retain people you know thats going to get better and better but thats a key element to our readiness recovery so we will continue to fund flying hours weapons sustainment to what we can execute staff ladies and gentlemen this is the final question gen martin over here q pat host with janes the numbers for rdte for you guys say  in your briefing book say  to  but in the overall dod book it says  to  i was wondering if you could explain the discrepancy gen martin yes i think were going to
