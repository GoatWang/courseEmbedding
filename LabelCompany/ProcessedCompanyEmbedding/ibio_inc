technology platform is a proprietary transformative technology for the production of biologics including monoclonal antibodies other therapeutic proteins and vaccines it uses proprietary transient gene expression in unmodified green plants instead of materials such as chicken eggs mammalian and insect cells transgenic plants and human blood plasma required by other systems to produce important biologic pharmaceuticals ibio has demonstrated the feasibility of developing and producing a wide range of products that are available for license along with the technology to bring them to patients ibio about ibio management team investor information investor overview branding high resolution logo  jpg format vaccines  ibio inc ibio vaccines home ibio technology vaccines ibio technology ibio technology is the manufacturing platform of choice when rapid response to pandemic threats is paramount vaccines are increasingly being developed from recombinant proteins representing highly immunogenic proteins of the natural pathogen in contrast to earlier vaccine technologies which used killed or weakened pathogens to stimulate an immune response the newer subunit vaccines offer an improved safety profile as well as the potential for a significantly simplified manufacturing and quality process the ibio technology delivers the improved safety and manufacturing profile demonstrated with subunit vaccines but unlike competitor technologies ibios extremely rapid gene sequencetomanufacturing timeline as little as one month makes the ibio technology the manufacturing platform of choice when rapid response to pandemic threats is paramount hookworms are parasitic nematodes that cause anemia and child development complications in infected individuals most commonly in tropical and subtropical environments ibio technology is being used to produce a vaccine antigen to an enzyme found in the gut of the hookworm antibodies to this gut enzyme block its action which normally acts to break down hemoglobin in the blood as a source of iron for the hookworm when this gut enzyme is blocked the hookworm dies allowing infected patients to resume a healthier life the antigenic form of this hookworm gut enzyme has proven to be impossible to manufacture efficiently using bacterial yeast or animal cell expression systems however commercially useful amounts of the antigen can be manufactured using the ibio technology plant expression technology and development of a vaccine in partnership with the sabin vaccine research institute is proceeding towards human safety and efficacy studies ibio technology offers a breadth of application that is unmatched the ibio technology expression platform has been used to manufacture vaccine candidates that represent a broad range of viral bacterial and parasitic threats to human health the technology has been used to successfully produce vaccine components that could not be manufactured using bacterial yeast or animal cell expression systems demonstrating a breadth of application that is unmatched each of these vaccines is available to be licensed from ibio along with the ibio technology manufacturing platform providing a turnkey entry into vaccine development and manufacturing yellow fever yellow fever was the first human disease to be proven to be caused by a virus and is transmitted via a mosquito bite a highly effective vaccine d was developed in  by max theiler for which he was later awarded the nobel prize this vaccine is a weakened but live version of the virus and is produced in embryonated chicken eggs however like other vaccines produced in eggs individuals who are allergic to eggs cannot receive the vaccine and others risk side effects including neurologic effects and organ failure children the elderly and immunocompromised individuals should not receive the d yellow fever vaccine the sideeffect profile has been increasingly unacceptable in regions of the world where yellow fever is present but acceptably managed because of these reasons a nextgeneration yellow fever vaccine is of high importance in tropical nations and a subunit vaccine made in plants is likely to have an improved safety profile while at the same time being highly effective in protection in partnership with fiocruzbiomanguinhos of brazil ibio and its research collaborator the fraunhofer usa center for molecular biotechnology have undertaken the development of this nextgeneration yellow fever vaccine a license agreement for the ibio technology manufacturing platform applied to the yellow fever vaccine has been established with fiocruzbiomanguinhos and by mutual agreement may be expanded to include other product applications influenza as part of its collaboration with external agencies such as the bill  melinda gates foundation global health initiative and the us department of defense advanced research projects agency subunit vaccines for avian influenza hn and pandemic influenza hn have been created and advanced into human safety and immunogenicity clinical studies these vaccines consist of the viral hemagglutinin ha antigen which is known to produce a protective immune response in humans malaria a vaccine for malaria has been elusive since the malaria parasite changes body forms during its life cycle and is kept hidden from the human immune system for much of its life the ibiomanufactured vaccine candidate is novel in that it is directed against a malaria parasite antigen this is commonly displayed on the parasite forms present in the gut of transmitting mosquitos individuals immunized against this mosquitoborne form of the parasite share antimalaria antibodies with the mosquito when the insect takes a blood meal and these antibodies block the maturation of the parasites in the insect gut ending the transmission cycle from mosquito to man and back to mosquito this vaccine candidate which has shown great promise in laboratory studies of malaria transmission was developed in a partnership with the bill  melinda gates foundation global health initiative hookworm hookworms are parasitic nematodes that cause anemia and child development complications and retardation in infected individuals most commonly in tropical and subtropical environments ibio technology is being used to produce a vaccine antigen to an enzyme found

chiefly cervical cancer but also increasingly anogenital and oral cancers there are multiple oncogenic serotypes of hpv and extensive efforts have been made to produce effective vaccines to prevent hpv infection however the ibio technology has been used to produce an experimental vaccine to one serotype of hpv hpv which causes the regression and loss of established hpv tumors in an animal model such a vaccine in humans has the potential to treat patients with established hpvrelated cancers for which current therapeutic options involve surgical resection followed by chemotherapy andor radiation treatment bacterial pathogens the ibio technology has been used to produce vaccines against plague yersinia pestis and anthrax bacillus anthracis the plague vaccine consists of two bacterial antigens f and lcrv and has been demonstrated in primates to provide complete protection against inhaled plague challenges when administered with an adjuvant a vaccine candidate to prevent anthrax infection has been manufactured and comprises a portion of the pathogen’s protective antigen and lethal factor proteins mice immunized with this dualantigen vaccine made antibodies to anthrax which

home ibio technology how it works ibio technology the ibio technology is a unique plantbased platform that accelerates the development and manufacturing of high levels of target protein  ibio scientists engineer vectors containing the target sequence within a viral replicon  the vector is transferred to an agrobacterium host that efficiently introduces target dna to the plant cell nucleus  the viral replicon directs the production of large amounts of targetspecific messenger rna in plant cells which is translated into protein by the plant’s own machinery for several days  once the plants have been infiltrated with agrobacteria the viral sequences of the launch vectors along with the cloned target sequences are massively amplified through the action of virally encoded enzymes translation of these recombinant viral vector mrnas can result in the accumulation of gram quantities of target protein per kilogram of fresh plant tissue in less than a week  the plants accumulate high levels of target protein in their leaf and stem tissue this expression of recombinant protein is termed “transient” expression because the target gene sequence is expressed as protein for a fixed period of time and the foreign genes are not incorporated into the plant chromosome to result in the creation of transgenic plants  the plant biomass is harvested homogenized and clarified to produce an extract containing the protein of interest proteins are further purified as required using conventional separation and chromatography steps widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry fast development and production the ibio technology dramatically speeds up drug development and production due to entire plants not being required to be genetically modified accelerated production and development is possible by using nongmo plants as manufacturing platform the ibio technology process eliminates the months or years needed by technologies using mammalian cells to find a highproducing stable cell clone that can be expanded into the trillions of daughter cells required for manufacturing useful amounts of a drug using the ibio technology a novel protein product can be produced at factory scale in under a month once a desired gene is cloned into the ibio technology vectors it is introduced into the leaves of the plants by automated vacuum infiltration technology over the next  days special features of the proprietary vectors ensure the gene spreads to every cell in the stems and leaves where the desired protein is expressed at extremely high levels flexible technology allows for agile production since the growth of plants and introduction of the ibio technology vectors is the same regardless of the desired product a facility using the ibio technology system can easily produce multiple proteins in the same facility without physical reconfiguration ibio stock price  ibio inc stock quote us nyse american  marketwatch sections watchlist signup • login search

its technologies and product candidates and providing product development and manufacturing services to clients and collaborators the companys technologies include ibiolaunch technology and ibiomodulator the companys technologies constitute a transformative platform for development and production of biologics in hydroponically grown green plants the company is focused on the commercialization of its plantbased protein expression technologies for vaccines and therapeutic proteins and on developing and commercializing select biopharmaceutical product candidates the companys technologies include the natural protein production capability that plants use to sustain their own growth and direct it instead to produce proteins for a range of applications including for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals the companys technology is applicable in a range of product candidates including products against fibrotic diseases vaccines enzyme replacements monoclonal antibodies and recombinant versions of marketed products that are derived from human blood plasmathe company has developed its ibiomodulator technology based on the use of a modified form of the cellulose degrading enzyme lichenase from clostridium thermocellum a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium the ibiomodulator technology enables an adjuvant component to be fused directly to preferred recombinant antigens to create a single protein for use in vaccine applications the ibiomodulator platform is applicable to a range of vaccine proteins the ibiomodulator technology platform is designed to improve the potency and duration of effect of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines produced with any recombinant expression technology including ibiolaunchthe companys technology platform ibiolaunch includes a range of technologies for the development and production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines using transient gene expression in green plants the ibiolaunch process begins with robotic seeding into an inert matrix for hydroponic growth followed by automated infiltration of the young seedlings for gene expression and protein production the ibiolaunch vectors are designed to bring foreign deoxyribonucleic acid dna to the nucleus of cells in the leaves of plants by allowing a vector and bacterial host to be introduced into the plant by infiltrating the bacterial vector host under a slight vacuum the bacterial vector launches the foreign dna into the plant nucleus where it is coded into instructions that direct the plants own protein manufacturing apparatus to make foreign proteins an arrangement of genes for plant viral enzymes causes these protein production instructions to be copied several times in each plant cell the companys gene transfer vectors combine the desirable features of the dna mobilization plasmid of agrobacterium tumefaciens with gene control elements taken from singlestranded ribonucleic acid rna plant virusesthe company is developing its product candidate ibiocfb for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf and systemic sclerosis ssc the company has produced human c esterase inhibitor and human alpha antitrypsin the therapeutic proteins that the company has produced range from large and complex monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins such as interferons growth factors and enzymes the company uses ibiolaunch to express and demonstrate the feasibility of production of a range of vaccine candidates the companys vaccine product candidates for hn influenza and hn influenza have completed phase i clinical trial its vaccine product candidate for yellow fever is in preclinical trial its vaccine product candidates for malaria and hookworm are in phase i clinical trial the company is also developing vaccine product

orphan drug designation for fibrosis product candidatemarketwiredjuly  reblogsharetweetsharenew york nymarketwired  jul    ibio inc  nyse mkt  ibio  a leading provider of plantbased biotechnology for developing and manufacturing biological products announced that the united states food and drug administration fda has granted orphan drug designation to ibios investigational biotherapeutic product ibiocfb for the treatment of systemic sclerosissystemic sclerosis is a fibrotic disorder that affects connective tissue of skin and internal organs as well as the walls of blood vessels early diagnosis and individualized therapy can be helpful but treatment of systemic sclerosis is limited to symptom management no approved drug currently available has been shown to arrest the underlying process or processes that drive progression of the diseasethis is an important step toward our goal for a family of ibio proprietary products against fibrotic diseases like systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis said robert b kay ibios executive chairman we expect to apply for additional orphan drug designations for products against additional fibrotic diseases viewed together and across the major geographic markets effective therapies against fibrotic diseases are among the most significant unmet medical needs in the worldthe fda office of orphan products development oopd grants orphan status to drugs intended for the safe and effective treatment diagnosis or prevention of rare diseasesdisorders that affect fewer than  people in the us designation of an investigational drug as an orphan product indicates that the drug qualifies for the benefits specified in the orphan drug act during development for the designated indication including tax credits for qualified clinical testing orphan drug exclusivity and an exemption from marketing application user fees as per fda guidelines orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval such as establishing the safety and efficacy of a drug through adequate and wellcontrolled studiesabout ibiocfbibiocfb is a recombinant plantmade protein

apr    ibio inc  nyse mkt  ibio   speaking to shareholders at the ibio inc  nyse mkt  ibio  annual meeting today chairman and chief executive officer robert b kay highlighted the companys most important achievements since its last annual meeting  first the creation of a new subsidiary for product development and largescale manufacturing using the companys proprietary plantbased technologies and second significantly advancing the companys own product candidates against fibrotic diseases toward human clinical trials targeted to commence in we expect the contract manufacturing joint venture between our recently formed subsidiary  ibio cmo llc  and affiliates of eastern capital to be transformative for ibio because we are now in a position to use our proprietary technologies to perform for our clients and ourselves each phase of biopharmaceutical development and commercial manufacturing from the early phases of product selection innovation and development through fullscale commercial production kay said these new comprehensive capabilities enable us to now provide a complete solution for product developer clients and ourselvesfy highlights and achievementsrobert erwin ibios president summarizing the companys progress during the prior year described the commercial advances achieved with its technologies including demonstrated time saving advantages for early stage product selection and development and also its advantages in eliminating both timeconsuming cell line selection and then bioreactor scaleup once a product lead is selected he then described some of the ways ibio is continuing to expand its capabilities by replacing older technologies with new proprietary inventions and methodologiesa good example of this is the success that has come from our engagement of novici biotech to create entirely new compositions of matter as prospective product candidates develop and employ new methodologies to increase the production yield of ibios and clients products with a particular focus on monoclonal antibodies and create novel gene expression vectors and process technologies said mr erwin based on laboratory and animal tests our product application successes include creating biobetter versions of certain antibodies some of which are for indications not yet addressed by commercial antibodies against viral diseases and some of which are derived from antibodies in current clinical use for cancer and infectious diseasewe are applying the power of our proprietary technologies to benefit our own products in our collaboration with dr carol feghalibostwicks laboratory through which we advanced development of our lead systemic sclerosis product candidate ibiocfb and also broadened our fibrosis portfolio to include novel therapeutic candidates of potential value for additional fibrotic disease indications the success of this work has proven once again that our technology can overcome challenges against various difficult product opportunities previous examples being antigens for malaria and hookworm vaccinesdevelopment of ibiocfb as a proprietary therapeutic product for fibrotic diseasemr erwin described the ability of the companys advanced technology to successfully modify product composition he described how we were able to take our fibrosis product initially produced by conventional chemical synthesis  a slow and expensive process  and more rapidly and less expensively produce a superior version using our proprietary technologies to make a recombinant derivative in plants this transition reduced the projected cost of manufacturing large scale quantities of drug substance and also significantly improved the pharmaceutical properties of the active ingredientmr erwin also described the rationale for the companys selection of systemic sclerosis as its first clinical indication in the fibrotic disease area including that early stage clinical trials for systemic sclerosis will target endpoints that can be objectively measured more rapidly than is possible with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf making the path to demonstration of efficacy shorter he disclosed and summarized the companys preind meeting with the fda in december  in which preclinical toxicology manufacturing and clinical trial design plans were reviewed and discussed and he commented on plans beyond the first clinical trialread moreibios collaborator and the lead inventor of ibiocfb dr carol feghalibostwick spoke to shareholders about her enthusiasm for the steady movement of her research results toward the clinic and her experience with ibio as a part of her overall effort to alter the clinical course of fibrotic disease she described the results of her use of human tissue explants in her research and discovery efforts and the significance of those results in providing confidence in the clinical prospects for ibiocfbmy association with ibio continues to be a rewarding experience said dr feghalibostwick together we are expanding the range of possibilities for clinical application of this research and look forward to soon see the first clinical trial beginregarding further plans and expectations for the fibrosis product development program mr erwin said we plan to request us and european orphan drug designation for our product first with systemic sclerosis and later for ipf based on preliminary laboratory data we are also considering additional indications for other fibrotic diseases we are optimistic about broadening and extending our fibrosis therapeutics intellectual property and managing this as a program rather than a single productexpansion of ibio patent portfoliomr erwin described ibios ongoing development of new patentable products and processes and listed the following us patents issued during calendar year plant viral expression vectors  us  system for expression of genes in plants the ibiomodulator™ carrier molecule system   recombinant carrier

leader in delivery of plantmade pharmaceuticalsmr douglas hicks ibios senior vice president of business development  strategy provided an overview of plans to establish ibio as the leading supplier of plantmade pharmaceuticals to international markets he described three categories of clients or collaborators expected to benefit from the combination of ibios technology and ibio cmos experience and capacitynonusbased government entities such as fiocruz in brazil and corporations committed to the development and autonomous manufacturing of key biologics including both vaccines and therapeutics wellestablished companies seeking traditional contract manufacturing services combined with the benefits of plantbased manufacturing government and university laboratories and early stage biotechnology companies seeking collaborative problemsolving and product developmentin the first case we anticipate supporting our collaborators with product and process development services initial manufacturing and technology transfer under productspecific licenses from ibio inc each of which represents a significant revenue opportunity said mr hicks in the second case we expect to generate revenue by providing high quality manufacturing services for companies at any stage in their product development and manufacturing cycle in the third case we see opportunities for ongoing benefit to ibio and ibio cmo from successful earlystage joint product development with our collaboratorsoperational design and capacity features of ibio cmodr r barry holtz ibio senior vice president product

conversation   faq  ibio inc ibio faq home about faq about what is ibio ibio nyse mktibio develops and offers product applications of its ibio technology platform providing collaborators full support for turnkey implementation of its technology for both proprietary and biosimilar products the ibio technology platform is a proprietary transformative technology for the development and production of biologics using transient gene expression in unmodified green plants the technology has been validated in both preclinical and clinical studies with interim positive results from a phase  clinical trial of an ibio technology platformproduced hn influenza vaccine ibio is actively engaged in a strategy to commercially license the ibio technology platform across multiple markets and geographic regions to provide various revenue streams further information is available at wwwibioinccom what is the ibio technology platform ibio technology is a new method for the production of biotherapeutics and subunit vaccines in whole plants bypassing expensive and complicated cell culture systems the proprietary ibio technology vector system utilizes the ability to efficiently introduce nonintegrating foreign dna into a plant cell nucleus by agrobacterium plasmids to launch virusbased mrna replication that takes over the plant cells protein synthesis to produce any desired protein the hybrid agrobacteriumviral gene system does not permanently alter the plants genetic makeup it is not transgenic and does not result in the production of plant virus particles transfer of the ibio technology vector to every cell in every leaf of the plant is near simultaneous and within four to seven days the desired protein accumulates transiently in the plant leaves where it can be easily harvested for purification unlike cell culture systems the ibio technology platform can be in production within weeks and does not require the timeconsuming identification and isolation of highproducing cell clones which need to be scaled up for manufacturing additionally the plants are grown in a soilfree hydroponic medium under strict climatic and lighting controls for the highest degrees of reproducibility no animal derived products or growth factors are utilized eliminating the risk of human pathogens being introduced in the manufacturing process and the expensive aseptic liquid handling process steps for cell culture are not required the ibio technology has been validated through the construction of a cgmp manufacturing facility that has provided clinical trial material for multiple fdaapproved studies what products can be made with the ibio technology platform the ibio technology platform has a wide range of commercial capability various proteins have been successfully produced with the ibio technology platform and demonstrated through preclinical and clinical studies to be safe efficacious and to have anticipated biological functionality these proteins include antibodies interferons and cytokines growth factors protease inhibitors clotting factors and enzymes for replacement therapy alphagalactosidase a in addition a variety of antigens for vaccines against diseases such as influenza anthrax malaria sleeping sickness plague and human papilloma virus have been produced as well as several therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of acute treatment of influenza and anthrax infections virtually any protein that can be produced in prokaryotic or other eukaryotic expression systems can be made in plants with the ibio technology platform with significant cost and pricing advantages where did ibio get its technology ibio is currently developing cfb a protein derived from endostatin with demonstrated antifibrotic effects cfb is produced using ibios proprietary plant manufactured protein technology and has been shown to arrest and reverse fibrotic disease in skin and lungs of preclinical models in both mice and human tissue cfb is in a preclinical research phase and is being developed initially for the treatment of diffuse systemic scleroderma will ibio develop its own products ibios investments to date have focused primarily on the development and application of its ibio technology platform product as ibio builds its revenue base through commercial alliances for the use of its platform technology it may choose to invest in earlystage clinical development from the best of the preclinical product targets the objective of the additional investment is to enhance the value prior to forming alliances with other companies for final development and marketing since biotechnology products have been successfully produced for so many years why is ibio technology important now the ibio technology platform has been validated in both preclinical and clinical studies as well as vetted by multiple government and nongovernment organizations through these processes ibios technology has demonstrated qualities that present numerous advantages over previous methods of manufacturing biotechnology products as measured by time cost flexibility and yield these advantages are likely to radically alter the way these important but expensive biological products are produced compared to existing technologies a manufacturing facility based on the ibio technology platform requires less capital infrastructure and has lower operating costs because expensive bioreactors and aseptic liquid handling technology is not required to generate production biomass the scalability and simplicity of the platform allow for modular growth and the ability to produce multiple products at a single facility using the ibio technology platform production cycles are reduced to days versus months for competitive processes since the platform contains no human or animal pathogens the safety profile of platform products is more attractive finally nearly unlimited surge capacity offers rapid response to pandemic disease threats or bioterrorism events what are the advantages of ibio technology for making biologics the key advantages of the ibio technology are speed simplicity flexibility and lower cost unlike more conventional systems that fundamentally alter a host cells dna there is no need to isolate and expand rare highproducing cell clones to production level a gene of interest can be cloned and inserted into the ibio technology vectors and be ready for production at scale within a months time the transient nature of this powerful expression system allows the accumulation of massive amounts of desired protein over a four to sevenday period when purification can then begin the simplicity of the ibio technology comes from the use of whole plants for the manufacturing of protein these plants can be grown in chemicallydefined medium in the open air or climatecontrolled greenhouse and do not require the expensive aseptic culture systems required to prevent contamination of cell culture production methods the system is highly flexible allowing the expression of vaccine antigens monoclonal antibodies replacement enzymes blood cell growth factors and many other products that cannot be produced by more traditional expression systems finally the low cost of raising whole plants to provide the biomass for manufacturing obviates the need for expensive bioreactors and medium as well as the lengthy and resourceintensive product development efforts seen with traditional cellculture manufacturing have products made with the ibio technology been tested in human clinical trials yes human clinical trials of products made using the ibio technology platform began in  with the initiation of phase  clinical trials of an h avian influenza vaccine sponsored by the bill  melinda gates foundation and a vaccine for hn influenza sponsored by darpa on june   ibio announced positive interim results from a phase  clinical trial of an ibio technology platformproduced subunit vaccine directed against influenza acalifornia hn the vaccine demonstrated a strong induction of dose correlated immune responses with or without adjuvant as assessed by virus neutralization assays and hemagglutination inhibition hai responses the vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses when administered with and without adjuvant in addition to the two influenza vaccines that have completed phase  studies a transmissionblocking vaccine for malaria sponsored by the path malaria vaccine initiative mvi a hookworm vaccine sponsored by the sabin vaccine institute and a vaccine to protect from anthrax conducted at the walter reed army institute of research are currently in phase  trials why can ibio produce influenza vaccines faster than companies that use chicken eggs ibios process is not dependent on being able to culture live viruses to genetically engineer cell lines or to produce large volumes of sterile starting material using the ibio technology platform a vaccine target can be produced in less than three weeks because the gene engineering process and the protein production processes are inherently faster than virus production in chicken eggs why does ibio use green plants plants carry out most of the same biochemical functions as human cells during protein synthesis and processing ibios technology provides a cost effective basis to use the ability of green plants to produce complex proteins ideally suited for human health applications why is ibio technology faster at producing than other plantbased protein companies ibio technology is a thirdgeneration plantbased protein expression technology the first generation which some companies still use relies on the creation of transgenic plants with a foreign gene permanently incorporated into the plants dna the second generation still used by some companies is based on transient virusbased infectious delivery of genes into nontransgenic plants while this technology works rapidly there are yield constraints and target product size limitations that limit its applicability the ibio technology harnesses the combined features of bacterial viral and plant biology to achieve the speed of transient production without the yield and size limitations of older technology because ibios technology is proprietary and protected by issued and pending patents it is not available to companies using older or publicly available technology except through commercial agreements with ibio how is ibios process less expensive than those used by other plantbased or mammalian cellproduced protein companies ibios technology is more efficient than previous methods of manufacturing biotech products as measured by time cost and yield and is likely to radically alter the way these important but expensive products are produced a manufacturing facility based on the ibio technology platform requires substantially less capital for the same dose capacity as facilities dependent on cultured animal cells or the even older approach of using bacterial fermenters or chicken eggs unit manufacturing costs are significantly lower because the ibio technology platform eliminates the need of expensive bioreactors additionally ibios technology includes proprietary features not available to companies using older or publicly available plantbased technologies these features enhance the economic efficiency of the ibio technology platform relative to others by providing higher yields and applicability to a broader range of products is it safer to produce biologics with plants than with animal cells there are obvious contamination risks that exist with the current methods of producing proteins using animal cells in bioreactors a good example of this type of contamination risk was demonstrated when a virus within a bioreactor shutdown production of a genzyme facility in allston ma the shutdown affected five genzyme drugs used to treat rare genetic disorders including two  cerezyme and fabrazyme  that were rationed due to short supply resulting from the facility shutdown animal viruses do not infect plants relieving the risk of contamination of mammalianbased manufacturing systems will there be problems obtaining fda approval for pharmaceuticals made with plants the fda is very familiar with the use of green plants to produce pharmaceutical proteins in  the fda formed a working group with the usda to provide a clear path for the use of plants in therapeutic protein and vaccine production the fda issued the draft guidance for industry drugs biologics and medical devices derived from bioengineered plants for use in humans and animals in  to set for guidelines on host plant selection environmental considerations processrelated issues and preclinical and clinical testing requirements the approach the fda takes to regulating vaccines and other biologics produced in plants is similar to their requirements for other methods of protein production in that product approval is dependent on the safety and efficacy of the product and consistency and reliability of the production process is there a risk with plants making human proteins incorrectly resulting in them not working for medical applications plants properly synthesize virtually any protein a human cell can synthesize by carrying out the same biochemical steps including correct signal sequence processing and proper protein folding and disulfide bridge formation in some cases glycosylation patterns may differ between plants and human cells but these differences can be controlled and corrected if they are significant to the function of the product recent scientific publications have suggested that plantmanufactured antiviral antibodiesmay be superior to those produced using mammalian cells due to enhanced killing of virusinfected cells have pharmaceuticals or vaccines made in plants ever been tested in humans yes human testing of products made using the ibio technology platform began in  with the initiation of phase  clinical trials of an h avian influenza vaccine sponsored by the bill  melinda gates foundation and a vaccine for hn influenza sponsored by darpa the first human test of a therapeutic protein made in plants was conducted by neorx corporation in  the product was neorxs experimental cancer therapeutic avicidin which incorporated a monoclonal antibody produced in transgenic plants by a unit of monsanto co unfortunately although there were no problems with the quality of the plantmade antibody itself the avicidin product was not successful about the same time planet biotechnology tested a transgenic plantderived antibody for the prevention of tooth decay in collaboration with guys hospital in london transgenic plants have since been used to produce several products that have entered human clinical trials including gastric lipase interferon and insulin the most advanced product is human glucocerebrosidase produced in transgenic carrot cells by protalix phase  human clinical trials have been completed and protalix has submitted data to the fda in support of an application for marketing approval viral vectors were used to produce proteins for individualized treatment of nonhodgkins lymphoma in a phase  clinical trial conducted in  the icon genetics unit of bayer ag is currently conducting a phase  clinical trial of individualized cancer therapy based on their transient expression technology for producing proteins in plants what is glycosylation and is it a problem glycosylation is a natural process in yeast plant insect and mammalian cells whereby carbohydrate residues are added as side chains to a protein glycosylation can promote the correct folding of a protein into the threedimensional structure required for the protein to function and can also help the protein resist breakdown in the body glycosylation across species tends to have a common core structure along with speciesspecific variations in most cases the common structure is sufficient to promote the correct folding of the protein while the variations seen in different species serve to optimize the performance of the protein in that species plants are entirely able to add the common core structure but cannot produce some of the variations seen with mammalianproduced glycoproteins without further manipulation of the plant system however these mammalianspecific modifications are in most cases not necessary for the proper function and bioactivity of a plantmanufactured protein the abundant scientific literature in this area grows daily some of the mammalianspecific modifications can be useful in stabilizing the protein as it circulates in the bloodstream but plantderived proteins such as monoclonal antibodies have circulation halflives comparable to mammalian produced versions as a final consideration the common mammalian expression systems come from rodent cells which add rodentspecific sugars to proteins that have been shown to cause immune responses in patients receiving drugs manufactured in these systems what other technology is competitive with ibios ibios numerous advantages make it extremely competitive against traditional methods of producing biologics such as animal cell bioreactors which are widely used by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies due to its scope of capability and cost structure the ibio technology platform offers advantages over the new technologies such as cultured insect cells transgenic plant technology and competing whole plant transient technologies which either lack ip protection or have limited product capabilities does ibio produce the final active ingredient or vaccine antigens used in products ibio is primarily in the business of licensing its platform technology to third parties for use in their own product manufacturing in cases in which ibio would manufacture for a client it would produce pharmaceutical grade protein active pharmaceutical ingredient api or vaccine antigens for formulation into the final product by the client what is ibios relationship with fraunhofer who owns the technology ibio has worked with the fraunhofer usa center for molecular biotechnology cmb since  and owns the ip and technology developed there including the ibio technology platform ibios commercial rights are worldwide and exclusive in the field of human health and include limited rights to veterinary applications ibio granted cmb an exclusive royaltybearing license to the technology for use in other fields under the terms of an existing multiyear agreement ibio continues to accrue ownership of new technology with exclusive rights in the human health field in exchange for ongoing research funding commitments to cmb what is ibios relationship with the bill  melinda gates foundation ibio and fraunhofer established a license agreement at the request of the bill  melinda gates foundation to address its interest in providing access to vaccines to the worlds poorest countries through the global access to vaccines initiative gavi fraunhofer has received substantial funding from the bill  melinda gates foundation to support development of vaccine products using the ibio technology the license to fraunhofer is nonexclusive and nonroyalty bearing and limited solely to global health vaccines which are vaccines for human or veterinary use for the prevention of malaria tuberculosis rotavirus trypanosomiasis hookworm and rabies the agreement establishes ibios technology as the preferred manufacturer of these vaccines and provides a right of first refusal to ibio to provide technology transfer for manufacturing services to achieve global access objectives on a commercially reasonable competitive and sustainable cost basis under the terms of the agreement fraunhofer will use the ibio technology to develop and test new gavi vaccines funded by the bill  melinda gates foundation in accordance with prior agreements ibio will own new technology and improvements to existing
