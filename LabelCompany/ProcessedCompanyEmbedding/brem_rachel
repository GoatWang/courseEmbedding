individuals longevity susceptibility to ageassociated diseases and many other attributes relevant for aging vary from one person to another these differences are due in part to dna sequence variants somewhere in our genomes—though exactly where is still a mystery in most cases worms flies and singlecelled microbes can serve as powerful models for the study of the principles of genetic variation research in the brem lab uses these model organisms to discover genetic changes that impact aging behaviors and other traits as well as their evolutionary histories the brem lab approach uses largescale analyses of thousands of genes at once both computational and experimental with ongoing work in the following areas the genetics of alternative polyadenylation most genes contain instructions for the production of a protein—a molecular machine that does work for the cell—including information that regulates the amount and timing of protein production the regulatory sequence included at the end of a gene is defined by a process called polyadenylation cancer cells have dramatic changes in polyadenylation positions across the genomes and in a few cases other human diseases have been associated with naturally occurring genetic variants at gene ends in general how polyadenylation differs among genetically distinct individuals is almost completely unknown  the brem lab is dissecting the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in gene ends and its impact on protein production the ultimate goal is to understand sequence signals that drive alternative polyadenylation in individual genes as well as the master regulatory factors that carry out processing at many gene ends in parallel current work involves cancer samples and wild singlecelled brewers’ yeast natural variation in yeast and fly aging phenotypes  longevity and its dependence on diet can vary dramatically between genetically distinct individuals and between species in the vast majority of cases the genetic basis of these differences is uncharacterized  the brem lab is mapping genes that underlie naturally occurring differences in lifespan in two model organism systems wild isolates of singlecelled yeast cultured in different growth media and wildcaught drosophila flies reared on different food sources the ultimate goal is to identify genes whose role in metabolism and aging is conserved between these simple organisms and humans polygenic evolution in wild environments when dna sequence variants in an organism’s genome confer a fitness advantage they are maintained and passed to progeny by the process of natural selection starvation resistance fertility and other traits relevant for aging have been tuned by natural selection during the evolution of many species likely including humans how do we discover precisely which genetic changes have enabled adaptive benefits during evolutionary history standard approaches examine the dna sequence of one gene at a time for signatures of natural selection but a suite of independent genetic variants at genes all over the genome may together underlie an advantageous trait the brem lab has developed methods to harness groups of genes rather than just one gene at a time to detect this type of polygenic natural selection these strategies use measurements of gene regulation across species as well as dna sequences from individuals in populations  the project’s current focus is on organismlevel advantages to brewers’ yeast that result from polygenic suites of genetic variants including metabolism and stress resistance dr brem’s phd thesis work was in the lab of ken dill at the university of california san francisco where she developed computational methods to model the forces that drive protein molecules to assemble as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of leonid kruglyak at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle she pioneered largescale experimental strategies to discover variants that underlie differences in gene regulation between genetically distinct individuals using singlecelled yeast as a model she began her independent research career as an assistant professor at the university of california berkeley before joining the buck institute in  she was a recipient of the burroughswellcome career award at the scientific interface and the ellison medical foundation new

imaging and intervention center and the program leader for breast cancer at the george washington cancer center dr brem works everyday to prevent breast cancer from taking more liveswhen dr brem was twelve years old her year old mother was diagnosed with breast cancer—and was given six months to live despite the odds dr brem’s mother lived  years after her diagnosis—but this diagnosis inspired dr brem to dedicate her life to curing breast cancerat  years old dr brem graduated from columbia medical school she then completed her radiology and breast imaging training at the johns hopkins hospital and joined the breast imaging team at johns hopkins  because of this philosophy dr brem often tried new equipment on herself before deciding whether or not to use it with her patients while practicing medicine dr brem always prioritizes every patient’s health and comfort one evening after her patients had gone home dr brem tried a piece of new equipment on herself she just wanted to examine the image quality of the technology—but what she found was her own breast cancer after fighting and beating the disease at age  and with three daughters aged   and  dr brem’s passion for her life’s work became even more intenseshe continues to channel that passion to change the face of breast cancer her accomplishments all involve new technologies for the early detection of breast cancer specifically she has led the field in computeraided detection cad molecular breast imaging mbi automated breast ultrasound systems abus and magnetic resonance imaging mri her advancements have led to many awards
