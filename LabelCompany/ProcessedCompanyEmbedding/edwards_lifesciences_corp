reason to own facebook mad money host jim cramer shares his take on the unfortunate fate of snap cramer also sits down with the ceo of edwards lifesciences who spoke to his companys revolutionary medical devices then he digs into one rallying biotechnology stock to see what could be next elizabeth gurdus  elizabethgurdus wednesday  jul    pm etcnbccom shares show chapters cramer remix snap is the no  reason to own facebook    wednesday  jul    pm et   when a caller asked jim cramer for his thoughts on the fate of snap inc he did not hesitate to give the social media company a dooming prognosis snap is the no  reason why you want to own facebook because we thought that instagram would be challenged by snap it turns out thats not the case the mad money host said on tuesday shares of snap fell to less than half of the stocks alltime high as analyst downgrades mostly related to the companys ability to improve its advertising platform poured in challenges from facebooks instagram continue to push shares lower despite snaps new rollouts of a maps feature and a daily news show with nbc tuesdays deals companies on the defense jim bourg  reuters cooking spices manufactured by mccormick  co the call came after cramer reviewed tuesdays news of two separate deals a potential merger between discovery and scripps networks interactive and spice company mccormick buying reckitt benckisers food division while the potential discoveryscripps deal at about  billion is more than twice the size of the  billion food transaction  these are happening for similar reasons companies afraid of losing their relevance and their clout are merging with their peers or rivals in order to produce stronger entities with more appeal to their masters meaning their distributors and their ultimate customers cramer said to understand why these two deals are so similar cramer compared the companies distribution methods just like you walk through aisles of a supermarket to find products you scroll through cable offerings to find things to watch rekindling investors interest getty images despite various investing outlets inciting fear in the stock market about singlestock risk cramer has seen average investors coming out of the woodwork to buy strong individual stocks i know there are tons of statistics showing an almost inexorable decline in interest in the stock market as a whole the mad money host said but theres something afoot right now right now after nine straight sessions where the nasdaq has rallied a total of  percent lately more people have been approaching cramer not just for photos but for conversations about his view on the market and on specific stocks he has recommended — a good sign he said boring unsexy dull and a buy ap equifax building in atlanta investors may worry about what is causing the stock markets monster rally but cramer insists that it is all about boring stocks like financial technology player equifax shares of equifax one of the countrys three biggest credit reporting agencies have been on fire rallying almost  percent in  and far outpacing the sp  index over the last five years how equifax makes money from the fees it collects from banks for checking customers credit scores selling software to help banks do that providing workforce solutions for companies human resources departments and selling subscriptionbased credit monitoring and identity theft protection to individual consumers the company also uses data and analytics technologies to provide unique insights on over  million consumers and over  million businesses around the world edwards lifesciences ceo surgical evolution scott mlyn  cnbc michael mussallem edwards lifesciences then cramer sat down with mike mussallem the chairman and ceo of edwards lifesciences to hear more about how the medical device company is continuing to grow theres been a great evolution in technology and surgery is still very important and certain patients really their life depends on surgery but this idea came about now almost  years ago and the first implant done almost  years ago and its really revolutionized the treatment for these patients mussallem told cramer on tuesday the stock of edwards has run up  percent so far in  so cramer dug deeper to find out how mussallem thought the company which specialized in artificial heart valves should best be valued the way you want to think about it is the total cost of the procedure the ceo said its not very often where we have these incredible technologies where you get better outcomes right better mortality less strokes you get improved quality of life for these patients which is a big deal and you have better economics this is one of those triple wins portola pharmaceuticals takeover potential having skyrocketed  percent so far this year portola pharmaceuticals stock seems to have regained its strength after jim cramer dubbed the biotech a disaster just over a year ago after wall street fell out of love with biotech stocks as a whole several years ago the stock fell from the s to the teens in late  but since the fda recently granted its leading drug regulatory approval the stock has been on fire climbing to nearly  as of tuesday i dont think its crazy to speculate about a potential takeover here the mad money host said if youre looking to speculate on a relatively young biotech you have got my blessing here although ideally i think you should wait for the next marketwide pullback to give you a better entry point oh and given the dearth of new drugs being created by the big pharmaceutical industry companies i do believe that if portola has a huge amount of success it will garner the attention of the big dogs and even if you are not one for speculation fda approval is a gamechanger for portola as it will give the company more solid footing in a market still wary of developmentstage biotechs cramer said lightning round i want more from this pharma name in cramers lightning round he sped through his take on some callers favorite stocks including pfizer you know its fine no one ever got hurt buying pfizer id like to see some new products out of there or a big acquisition or maybe the splitup that theyve been talking about but its not going to run away from you believe me forterra yeah its a pipe company and the problem with a pipe company is if you go back over the csx presentation this morning they said pipe sales their actual cargo are way down i dont want to be involved with that too much pipe involved with infrastructure lets see what nucor says when they report to see if theres hope for infrastructure im not clear disclosure cnbc parent nbcuniversal is an investor in snap questions for cramer call cramer cnbc want to take a deep dive into
