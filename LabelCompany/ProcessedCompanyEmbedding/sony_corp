article history of sony masaru ibuka the cofounder of sony tokyo tsushin kogyoedit sony began in the wake of world war ii in  masaru ibuka started an electronics shop in a department store building in tokyo the company started with a capital of ¥ and a total of eight employees in may  ibuka was joined by akio morita to found a company called tokyo tsushin kogyo  tokyo telecommunications engineering corporation the company built japans first tape recorder called the typeg in  the company changed its name to sony nameedit when tokyo tsushin kogyo was looking for a romanized name to use to market themselves they strongly considered using their initials ttk the primary reason they did not is that the railway company tokyo kyuko was known as ttk the company occasionally used the acronym totsuko in japan but during his visit to the united states morita discovered that americans had trouble pronouncing that name another early name that was tried out for a while was tokyo teletech until akio morita discovered that there was an american company already using teletech as a brand name the name sony was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words one was the latin word sonus which is the root of sonic and sound and the other was sonny a common slang term used in s america to call a young boy in the s japan sonny boys was a loan word into japanese which connoted smart and presentable young men which sony founders akio morita and masaru ibuka considered themselves to be the first sonybranded product the tr transistor radio appeared in  but the company name did not change to sony until january  at the time of the change it was extremely unusual for a japanese company to use roman letters to spell its name instead of writing it in kanji the move was not without opposition ttks principal bank at the time mitsui had strong feelings about the name they pushed for a name such as sony electronic industries or sony teletech akio morita was firm however as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry eventually both ibuka and mitsui banks chairman gave their approval globalizationedit according to schiffer sonys tr radio cracked open the us market and
