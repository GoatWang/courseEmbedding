the supertanker unilever ride the crest of a wave can a newcastle united owner change his stripes lots of lolly if it’s dependably dull you want unilever’s halfyear results on thursday should fit the bill if it’s off the wall you are after there’s always sports direct international plc lonspd which releases fullyear figures a frisson of excitement might also be evident in lowcost airline easyjet’s statement after chief executive carolyn mccall’s decision to jump ship and join itv looking for some unileverage following the shortlived takeover approach from kraft heinz co nasdaqkhc earlier this year unilever plc lonulvr unveiled its ‘connected  growth’ programme aimed at improving shareholder value that programme included targets such as boosting underlying margins to  by  so investors will be looking to see what progress is being made under this new strategy eyes will also be focused on business in latin america an exciting highgrowth potential area for unilever but one that has been beset by macroeconomic troubles recently particularly in brazil as was evident in the first quarter last month’s acquisition of hourglass a luxury cosmetics brand took unilever even further into the premium personal care market following on from other recent deals in skin and hair care so it will be interesting to see how that division is coming along revenues are expected to rise  from last year to €bn with the company hoping to deliver underlying growth within its  target range  something it just failed to do in the first quarter headline operating profit is tipped to rise to €bn from €bn a year ago or €bn vs €bn in  once restructuring costs and other oneoffs are accounted for sports direct taking a pounding from sterlings weakness “premium” is not a term one immediately associates with sports direct but founder mike ashley is not afraid to take a stake in any retailer no matter what market it addresses as his company’s recent acquisition of a  stake in struggling video games

specialist findel plc lonfdl and sportswear rival jd sports plc lonjd ashley wants to turn sports direct into the “selfridges of sports retail” we know leopards can’t change their spots but can the owner of newcastle united football club change his stripes in an effort to boost business sports direct has been expanding its portfolio with the acquisition of  stores in the us under the bob’s stores and eastern mountain stores brands liberum expects the ftse  retailer to report a fall in full year adjusted pretax profit to £mln down from £mln on the back of its acquisition spree and the hit from a weaker pound while sales are forecast to rise to £bn from £bn the group’s firsthalf results in december saw sports direct report a  slump in profits battered by the fall in the value of the pound after the brexit vote the thirdquarter trading update from easyjet plc lonezj on thursday will give an idea of the strength of summer trading for the discount airline after a weak firsthalf performance due to a combination of currency pressures from the weaker pound and the later timing of easter no thrills airline days after revealing that it is looking for approval to establish a new airline headquartered in vienna to enable it to continue to operate flights both across europe and domestically within european countries after brexit easyjet should see a better performance with summer  having been impacted by the eu vote uncertainties with the weak firsthalf numbers in july mccall noted that increased bookings this year reflected “growing evidence that consumers are prioritising expenditure on flights and holidays above other nonessential items” recent results from the airlines have been strong noted neil wilson at etx capital “after a turbulent period throughout
