huckleberry finn by william colon blake reyes enoch johnson ben m no description by william colon on  february  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of the adventures of huckleberry finn by william colon blake reyes enoch johnson ben ma theme in the adventures of huckleberry finn is racism and slavery though the book was written after the end of the civil war the southern states in america was still struggling with racism and the effects of slavery by the early s there was a plan to put the united states back together and integrate the freed slaves into society this plan was called reconstruction although at the time it was not working but it hadn’t failed outright mark twain set the novel a couple of decades in the past when slavery was still a common fact of life in huckleberry finn twain exposes the hypocrisy of slavery he demonstrates how racism affects the oppressors as much as it affects those who are oppressed themeanother theme of huckleberry finn is the hypocrisy of a “civilized” society when huck plans to head west at the end of the story he says he is leaving to avoid further “sivilizing” during the story twain expresses the society around huck as a collection of degraded rules and concepts that defy logical thinking the nonlogical type of thinking comes into the story when the judge allows pap’s “rights” to his own son but yet at the same time to me this is just another way of having a system that puts a white man’s rights to his property or his slaves literary analysisplotthroughout the twentieth century the adventures of huckleberry finn has become famous not only as one of twains greatest achievements but also as a highly controversial piece of literature in certain southern states the novel was banned due to its extensive criticism of the hypocrisy of slavery others have argued that the novel is racist due to the many appearances of the word nigger unfortunately the connotations of this word tend to override the novels deeper antislavery themes and prevent readers from understanding twains true perspective in twains time this word was used often and did not carry as powerful a racist connotation as it does currently therefore in using the word twain was simply projecting a realistic portrayal of southern society undoubtedly the adventures of huckleberry finn is highly significant due to its deep exploration of issues surrounding racism and morality and continues to provide controversy and debate to this day evidencing the continued relevance of these conceptsbackground of the bookmark twainthe adventures of huckleberry finnquotationsthe widow douglas she took me for her sonand allowed she would civilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when icouldnt stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead againand was free and satisfied but tom sawyerhe hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i join if i would go back to the widow so i went backi hadnt had a bite to eat since yesterday sojim he got out some corndoggers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so good when its cooked right  and whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good timewe said there warnt no home like a raft after allother places do seem so cramped up and smoothery but a raft dont you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raftit was a close place i took up theletter written from watson  and heldit in my hand i was trembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knew it istudied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then ill go to hell  and tore it up it was awful words but theywas said and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reformingquotation quotation quotation born in  florida missouri

of a “civilized” society when huck plans to head west at the end of the story he says he is leaving to avoid further “sivilizing” during the story twain expresses the society around huck as a collection of degraded rules and concepts that defy logical thinking the nonlogical type of thinking comes into the story when the judge allows pap’s “rights” to his own son but yet at the same time to me this is just another way of having a system that puts a white man’s rights to his property or his slaves example there are also symbols throughout the story to me the biggest symbol in the story was the mississippi river for huck and jim the mississippi river is a symbol of freedom they don’t have to answer to anyone while they are on their raft floating on the river and for both huck and jim freedom is something different for jim freedom is going towards the free states and for huck freedom is getting away from his abusive father and the “sivilizing” of his town but further on in the story the river becomes more and more dangerous as they run into evils and even the influences of towns on the banks of the river although the river offers a refuge from trouble it also is leading from one bad situation to another and with each of their escapes they continue on a continual drift southward towards the deep south and entrenched slavery as huck and jim continue down the river thee once thought paradise and source of freedom turns into a short term means of escape that continuously takes them further towards danger full title  the adventures of huckleberry finnauthor  mark twain

attempts to civilize him represented by the widow douglas miss watson and other adults later this conflict gains greater focus in huck’s dealings with jim as huck must decide whether toturn jim in as society demands or to protect and help his friend insteadrising action · miss watson and the widow douglas attempt to civilize huck until pap reappears in town demands huck’s money and kidnaps huck huck escapes society by faking his own death and retreating to jackson’s island where he meets jim and sets out on the river with him huck gradually begins to question the rules society has taught him as when in order to protect jim he lies and makes up a story to scare off some men searching for escaped slaves although huck and jim live a relatively peaceful life on the raft they are ultimately unable to escape the evils and hypocrisies of the outside world the most notable representatives of these outside evils are the con men the duke and the dauphin who engage in a series of increasingly serious scams that culminate in their sale of jim who ends up at the phelps farmcontinuationsamuel clemens also known as mark twain was born in florida missouri in  he moved to hannibal missouri when he was four at age  the young clemens went to work to help support his family when his father died he began working as a printers apprentice for his brother orion at  later on as a young man he worked

mississippi during the civil war twain spent a few weeks in the confederate army befor resigning and heading to nevada where his brother orion had been appointed territorial secretary while in nevada clemens started writing again this is when he adopted the pen name mark twain a term used in river navigation mark twain means water that is two fathoms or about  feet deeptwain used experiences in the first three decades of his life for ideas for the stories he would later write an example of this is a famous civil war incident which twain later recounted roughing it in  a nevada man named reul gridley received a  pound sack of flour as a payment for a wager he decided to auction it off with the proceeds going to the newly formed united states sanitary commission the winner put the flour for auction again and so did the next winner the sack traveled from town to town changing hands over and over but remained on the auction block as gridley raised  for wounded union soldiers and sailorsin

innocent observations of the uneducated huck and the evenlesseducated escaped slave jim william dufriss voice unpretentious and disarming like the books main characters seems the perfect armature on which to hang this literary strategy although he does an expert job with the entire cast dufriss delivery of jims dialogue is his crowning achievement out of context dufriss jim might sound mocking and racist due to his expert delivery of twains regional vernacular ignorance and intelligence however are not mutually exclusive and taken as a whole jims mind and heart come shining through allowing the listener to reflect on their own assumptions tantor media includes the entire text as a digital ebook on the final cd a wise and thoughtful move in a market with swift and changing
