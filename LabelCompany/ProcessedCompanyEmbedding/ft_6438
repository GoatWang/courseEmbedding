survey  p a literature review of best management practices to reduce nutrient loading was performed to provide information for resource managers in the klamath basin oregon although bmps have already been implemented in the watershed some sense of their effectiveness in reducing phosphorus loading and their cost for installation and maintenance is still lacking this report discusses both causes of nutrient loading and a widevariety of bmps used to treat or reduce causal factors we specifically focused on cattle grazing as the principal landuse and causal factor for nutrient loading in the klamath basin above upper klamath lake oregon several bmp types including stream corridor fencing riparian buffer strips and constructed wetlands seem to have potential for reducing phosphorus loading that may result from cattle grazing however no single bmp is likely to be the most effective in all locations or situations related projects no science projects found        sharon campbellsharon
