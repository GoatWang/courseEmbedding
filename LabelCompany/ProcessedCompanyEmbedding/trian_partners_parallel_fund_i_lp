highly qualified candidates for election to dupont board referendum on performance dupont board has not held management accountable for repeatedly missing promised revenue and earnings targets newly revealed poor corporate governance at chemours shows board disconnect from dupont stockholders january    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wiretrian fund management lp “trian” one of the largest stockholders of e i du pont de nemours and company nyse dd “dupont” announced today that it has nominated four highly qualified candidates for election to the dupont board of directors at the  annual meeting of stockholders investment funds managed by trian currently beneficially own an aggregate of approximately  million dupont shares valued at approximately  billion trian believes longterm success requires each of dupont’s business segments to achieve bestinclass operating metrics despite management’s rhetoric about the value of “integrated science” the reality is that dupont is struggling operationally  earnings per share are down since   organic revenue growth and margins have underperformed peers in five of the company’s seven segments and  management has lowered andor missed its own guidance to wall street for the third year in a row while consistently failing to achieve the revenue and margin targets presented at dupont’s  investor day trian believes the dupont board has not held management accountable for continuing underperformance and repeated failures to deliver publicly stated revenue and earnings targets in addition trian believes the dupont board’s recent decision to spinoff chemours its performance chemicals segment with poor corporate governance and punitive antitakeover measures  including a classified board no stockholder action by written consent an  supermajority vote required for stockholders to amend chemours’ bylaws or certain provisions of its certificate of incorporation including those relating to the election classification and nomination of directors and a high  threshold of stockholders to call a special meeting  shows a disconnect from stockholders trian believes it is time for new perspectives and robust oversight from the dupont board trian is therefore nominating a minority slate of four directors with extensive operating strategic and financial experience and a history of generating longterm shareholder value to work with the continuing directors to achieve the great potential of this iconic company trian’s four highly qualified director nominees are nelson peltz chief executive officer and a founding partner of trian and a director of mondelēz international inc the wendy’s company and the madison square garden company john h myers former president and chief executive officer of ge asset management and currently a director of legg mason inc arthur b winkleblack former executive vice president and chief financial officer of hj heinz company and currently a director of rti international metals inc and church  dwight co inc robert j zatta acting chief executive officer and longtime chief financial officer of rockwood holdings inc a leading global developer manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals in a letter to dupont’s board on september   a copy of which will be filed with the securities and exchange commission on january   trian outlined five reasons for dupont’s persistent underperformance  excessive holding company costs  overwhelming complexity  bureaucracy and a lack of management accountability  inefficient capital structure and  a persistent conglomerate discount to its share price in the letter trian proposed a separation of dupont into growthco agriculture nutrition and health industrial biosciences and cyclicalcocashco performance materials safety and protection electronics and communications in addition to separating performance chemicals trian views a separation as a means to an end elimination of an entire layer of corporate overhead elimination of corporate bureaucracy in order to empower management assure accountability speed decision making create focus and reduce complexity catalyst for a “clean slate” to design the ideal cost structure through “zerobased budgeting” more accountability on returns on research and development high probability of valuation multiple rerating trian believes a separation would greatly increase the likelihood that the individual businesses will eliminate the operational gap versus peers the substantial increase in profitability at axalta coatings systems dupont’s former performance coatings business following its sale to a private equity firm in  as detailed in trian’s september   letter is a powerful example of the benefits of focus and the excessive costs incurred by dupont nevertheless trian does not intend this election to be a referendum on separating the businesses but rather a referendum on dupont’s performance if elected to the board the trian nominees will seek to work collaboratively with the other board members to determine whether value can be optimized in the current structure or through a separation dupont is one of trian’s largest investments trian has a strong vested interest in dupont’s future and takes pride in its reputation as a longterm shareholder with a history of designing and implementing valueadded strategic and operating initiatives at many companies trian has been patient giving management more than a year and a half to prove it could achieve its publicly stated financial goals trian believes all stockholders will benefit from the election of trian’s nominees who will stimulate robust dialogue and enhanced engagement in the board room trian’s director nomineesbiographies for each nominee follow nelson peltz has served as chief
