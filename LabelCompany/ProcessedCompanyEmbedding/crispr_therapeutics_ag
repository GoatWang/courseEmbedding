based on the initial public offering price of  per share after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us bayer global investments bv has agreed to purchase from us concurrently with this offering in a private placement  million of our common shares at a price per share of  which is the initial public offering price we are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets to increase our liquidity and to support continued development of our research programs we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as follows • approximately  million to advance the development of our hemoglobinopathy programs • approximately  million to progress additional pipeline candidates • approximately  million to further optimize our crisprcas gene editing platform and develop delivery technologies and • the remainder if any for manufacturing working capital and general corporate purposes however due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement that may be used for the above purposes the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including the results of our research and development efforts the timing and success of our ongoing preclinical studies or preclinical studies we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory submissions as a result our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds in addition we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement and our other sources of cash are less than expected although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement along with our existing cash and cash equivalents together with interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next  months we believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions or inlicenses of complementary companies or technologies while we have no current agreements commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions or inlicenses at this time we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes pending the use of the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement we intend to invest the net proceeds in interestbearing investmentgrade securities certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us and swiss governments the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including in the gene therapy and gene editing fields are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products while we believe that our technology development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages we currently face and will continue to face competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions for any products that we may ultimately commercialize not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development we will have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future we compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical biotechnology and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies including gene editing and gene therapy there are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs our platform and product focus is on the development of therapies using crisprcas technology other companies developing crisprcas technology include intellia therapeutics inc and editas medicine inc there are additional companies developing therapies using additional geneediting technologies including talens meganucleases and zinc finger nucleases the companies developing these additional geneediting technologies include bluebird bio cellectis poseida therapeutics precision biosciences and sangamo biosciences additional companies developing gene therapy products include abeona therapeutics avalanche biotechnologies dimension therapeutics regenxbio spark therapeutics and uniqure in addition to competition from other geneediting therapies or gene therapies any products that we develop may also face competition from other types of therapies such as small molecule antibody or protein therapies we may also face future competition from newly discovered gene editing technologies or new crisprassociated nucleases while we believe that crisprcas will be highly effective for many therapeutic applications and are actively working to further enhance the technology more efficient gene editing technologies may emerge for example recent publications by feng zhang phd one of the founders of editas medicine inc and others have elucidated a different crisprassociated nuclease cpf which can also edit human dna some have argued that cpf is superior to cas for certain applications gene editing is a highly active field of research and new technologies related or unrelated to crispr may be discovered and create new competition in addition many of our current or potential competitors either alone or with their collaboration partners have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy safety convenience and availability of reimbursement if our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials they may compete with other products currently under development including gene editing and gene therapy products competition with other related products currently under development may include competition for clinical trial sites patient recruitment and product sales in addition due to the intense research and development that is taking place by several companies including us and our competitors in the gene editing field the intellectual property landscape is in flux and highly competitive there may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings in addition to the ongoing interference proceedings relating to our owned and inlicensed and other third party intellectual property and proprietary rights in the future for example in january  at our request the uspto declared an interference between one of the pending us patent applications we licensed from dr emmanuelle charpentier and twelve issued us patents and subsequently added one us patent application owned jointly by broad because our application was filed first the uspto designated dr charpentier california and vienna or vienna collectively as “senior party” and designated broad as “junior party” following motions by the parties and potentially a determination regarding which of the two parties was the first to invent the ptab might conclude that the contested subject matter is not patentable to the senior party and is patentable to the junior party which in this case could preclude our us patent applications from issuing as patents in which case the proceedings would result in our losing the right to protect core innovations and our freedom to practice our core gene editing technology similarly toolgen inc or toolgen filed suggestions of interference in the uspto on april   and december   suggesting that they believe some of the claims in pending us applications owned by toolgen us serial no  and us serial no  respectively interfere with certain claims in five of the broad patents currently involved in the interference with dr emmanuelle charpentier california and vienna we are also aware of additional third parties that have pending patent applications relating to crispr technologies which similarly may lead to further interference proceedings for example rockefeller university has filed a continuation application us serial no  of an application filed by the broad that rockefeller’s employee luciano marraffini as coinventor of crisprcas technology vilnius university has filed applications in the united states and abroad published internationally as wo and wo harvard university has filed applications in the united states and abroad published internationally as wo and sigma aldrich has filed applications in the united states and abroad published internationally as wo each claiming aspects of crisprcas technology based on applications claiming priority to provisional filings in  numerous other filings are based on provisional applications filed after  both broad and toolgen have filed international counterparts of their us applications some of which were granted in europe andor other foreign jurisdictions we and third parties have initiated opposition proceedings against some of these grants and we may in the future oppose other grants to these or other applicants company description we are a leading gene editing company focused on the development of crisprcasbased therapeutics crisprcas is a revolutionary technology for gene editing the process of precisely altering specific sequences of genomic dna the application of crisprcas for gene editing was coinvented by one of our scientific founders dr emmanuelle charpentier who along with her collaborators published work elucidating how crisprcas a naturally occurring viral defense mechanism found in bacteria can be adapted for use in gene editing we are applying this technology to treat a broad set of rare and common diseases by disrupting correcting or regulating the disease related genes we believe that our scientific expertise together with our approach may enable an entirely new class of highly active and potentially curative treatments for patients for whom current biopharmaceutical approaches have had limited success we are pursuing a twopronged product development strategy using both ex vivo and in vivo approaches our most advanced programs in hemoglobinopathies use an ex vivo approach whereby cells are harvested from a patient treated with a crisprcasbased therapeutic and reintroduced into the patient beyond these lead programs we are pursuing a number of additional ex vivo applications as well as select in vivo applications whereby the crisprcas therapeutic is delivered directly to target cells within the human body our initial in vivo applications will leverage wellestablished delivery technologies for genebased therapeutics given the numerous potential therapeutic applications for crisprcas we have partnered strategically to broaden the indications we can pursue and accelerate development of programs by accessing specific diseasearea expertise we have established a joint venture with bayer ag and its subsidiaries in which we hold a  interest and a collaboration agreement with vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated which together will provide over  million subject to certain conditions inclusive of estimated spending on funded programs as well as access to distinctive capabilities for the development of crisprcas gene editing product candidates we have assembled a team with extensive experience in drug discovery and clinical development to successfully bring crisprcasbased therapeutics to patients we believe our highly experienced team product development strategy partnerships and intellectual property position us as a leader in the development of crisprcasbased therapeutics  we were incorporated as a swiss stock corporationaktiengesellschaft on october   under
