investment products that it sold to consumers numerous lawsuits have been filed by investors who allege that they were misled about the value of the life settlement policies that they purchased through life partners because they were provided with inaccurate life expectancy estimates  the us securities and exchange commission has also filed a life partners lawsuit accusing the company and three of its executives of securities violations in connection with their use of life expectancy estimates that according to the sec life partners knew were materially short what are ‘life settlements’ a “life settlement” is a life insurance policy that is purchased from the original insured for an amount less than the face amount of the policy ie less than the death benefit when the insured subsequently dies called a maturity the policy proceeds are paid to the purchaser of the policy the investor as opposed to the family of the insured once a life settlement is acquired the purchaser is obligated to pay the premiums on the policy to keep it in force until maturity life partners gathers investment funds from wouldbe investors for the purpose of purchasing life settlement policies life partners arranges to purchase the policies from insureds on behalf of investors for a certain price but then charges its customersinvestors a substantially higher price to acquire an interest in the policies the difference between the amount paid to the insured by life partners and the amount paid by the investor to life partners to acquire an interest in the policy is retained by life partners as their “fee” typically investors each purchase a small percentage of numerous policies which is called fractional ownership in addition to paying an amount to acquire an interest in each policy investors must also provide to life partners an amount to cover premiums during the life expectancy of the insured these funds are deposited in an account to be used at the direction of life partners to pay premiums to keep the policy in force key to how much an investor should be willing to pay for an interest in a policy is the life expectancy of the insured the longer the insured lives then the longer the investor’s money and associated opportunity cost is tied up in the investment and the more premiums the investor will have to pay to maintain the policy this reduces or eliminates the return on investment as a result a prudent investor should be willing to pay much more for a given percentage of a policy if the life expectancy is short than if the life expectancy is long lawsuits against life partners in the various lawsuits against life partners it is alleged that the company used a physician by the name of dr cassidy to obtain life expectancy assessments on insureds that were far shorter than their true life expectancy thus the lawsuits claim life partners was able to acquire the polices for a low price based on the true life expectancy and then sell them to their customersinvestors for much higher amounts based on the cassidy life expectancy keeping the difference as their profit heygood orr  pearson has brought numerous lawsuits on behalf of investors against life partners over the dr cassidy life expectancies one of heygood orr  pearson’s clients invested in  different policies over  years ago dr cassidy’s life expectancy evaluations were all in the  to  year range if dr cassidy’s life expectancy evaluations were accurate then approximately half of the policies should have already matured in reality not one of the  policies has matured by using the bogus dr cassidy life expectancy assessments to sell their customersinvestors life settlements at greatly inflated prices heygood orr  pearson asserts on behalf of its clients in various lawsuits that life partners was guilty of fraud breach of fiduciary duty violations of consumer protection laws and breach of contract life partners under investigation by sec life partners inc is also under investigation by the us securities and exchange commission sec due to its accounting practices and alleged bogus life expectancy estimations in january of  the sec filed a lawsuit against life partners in federal court in waco texas in this lawsuit the sec alleges that life partners and their officers brian pardo and scott peden engaged in a disclosure and accounting fraud that misled the company’s shareholders about the sustainability of life partners’ revenues and profit margins and consumer demand for the life settlement investments the lawsuit further alleged that pardo and peden profited from the fraud by trading on inside information that life partners systematically uses life expectancy estimates that the company knows to be materially short in brokering life settlements the sec asserts that life partners engaged in this practice to artificially inflate the company’s revenues and profit margins read more about the sec lawsuit against life partners in january  the sec’s case against life partners holdings inc and its executives pardo and peden went to trial after almost two days of deliberations the jury found in favor of the sec on section a of
