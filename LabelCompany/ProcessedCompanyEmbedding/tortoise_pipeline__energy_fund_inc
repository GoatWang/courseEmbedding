information about the funds copies of the funds’ prospectus may be obtained by calling tcafund read it carefully before investing mutual fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible the funds are nondiversified meaning they may concentrate their assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund therefore the funds are more exposed to individual stock volatility than diversified funds investing in specific sectors such as north american energy may involve greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments risks include but are not limited to risks associated with energy investments including upstream energy companies midstream companies downstream companies energy company beneficiaries mlps mlp affiliates commodity price volatility supply and demand regulatory environmental operating capital markets terrorism natural disaster and climate change risks the tax benefits received by an investor investing in the funds differ from that of a direct investment in an mlp by an investor the value of the funds investments in an mlp will depend largely on the mlps treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes if the mlp is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the funds which could result in a reduction of the funds values investments in foreign companies involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of us issuers including risks related to political social and economic developments abroad differences between us and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements tax risk and market practices as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies the funds invest in large small and midcap companies which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise this risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities investment in lowerrated and nonrated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higherrated securities the funds may also write call options which may limit the funds abilities to profit from increases in the market value of a security but cause it to retain the risk of loss should the price of the security decline some funds may invest in other derivatives including options futures and swap agreements which can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value and changes in the value of a derivative held by the funds may not correlate with the underlying instrument or the funds other investments and can include additional risks such as liquidity risk leverage risk and counterparty risk that are possibly greater than risks associated with investing directly in the underlying investments some funds may engage in short sales and in doing so are subject to the risk that they may not always be able to borrow a security or close out a short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to
