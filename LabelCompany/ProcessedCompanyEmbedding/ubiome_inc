probiotics what are probiotic foods – ubiome ubiome englishespañoldeutschitaliano probiotics guide what are probiotics your gut plays host to a wide variety of species of bacteria there’s quite a lot of it down there too like most humans you probably have between  and  different species in your gastrointestinal tract but for the most part it’s definitely something to be relieved about rather than to lose sleep over you see in today’s fussilyclean world there can sometimes be a popular tendency to believe that bacteria are bad for us but although it’s true that a few species can be harmful particularly in large amounts the truth is that most bacteria are harmless and in fact quite a few are actually pretty crucial to life right now for example your gut probably contains certain types of bacteria that are synthesizing vitamins and others which are helping you digest some kinds of foods fiber particularly that your own body is not equipped to process with a good diet and the absence of illhealth your microbiome will tend to keep itself well balanced what happens however when conditions aren’t quite so perfect perhaps your diet isn’t ideal or for one reason or another you find yourself under a lot of stress in cases such as these you can end up with less of the good types of bacteria and more of the bad which is when some experts say it can help to consciously “top up” with healthy bacteria using supplements we call probiotics so what are probiotics exactly technically speaking probiotics are preparations containing live bacteria which are taken orally to restore your body’s beneficial bacteria in simpler terms they’re good bacteria you eat drink or swallow in order to have a healthier gut  or just to keep it in good order the word probiotic means “for life” and there are two main ways to get probiotics down into your gastrointestinal tract  eat foods which are naturally rich in healthy bacteria  swallow speciallyprepared capsules that have been manufactured to contain the right sorts of concentrated bacteria one important consideration is that probiotics must consist of live microorganisms in fact this is how the world health organization defines them another is that the microbial content of probiotics need to be capable of surviving their lengthy journey through the stomach’s fiercely acidic conditions as well as other perils in order to reach the right place in the intestines your stomach can be a hostile place for tiny defenseless microbes gastric acid is about as strong as battery acid so probiotics must either be naturally resilient or helped to be so via the capsules they’re contained in in the case of supplements are your probiotics working the benefits of probiotics one useful indicator of how wellbalanced your gut bacteria are is the regularity of your bowel movements in fact for many people a change in this respect is the first sign that taking probiotics might be a good idea and research shows that probiotics can indeed be good for digestive health diarrhea or constipation may provide an indication that your body’s bacteria need rebalancing with probiotics and there is also reasonable evidence that they may also help with other disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and possibly even crohn’s disease in addition to improving digestive health probiotics are also likely to boost your immune system  the mechanism that defends your body from invading microbes one of the ways in which probiotics can make this happen is by raising your levels of something called “mucin” proteins which help form the mucosal lining of your gut what does mucin do well it plays an important part in developing an environment in which bad bacteria can’t thrive and also helps to protect your intestines from friction and erosion while many people have naturally effective immune systems immunity is often compromised as you age or if you find yourself in stressful life situations another way in which probiotics may contribute to better health is in helping to protect the lining of your gut your gastrointestinal tract contains bacteria which while relatively harmless in your gut would cause significant health issues were they to escape into your bloodstream as we’ve already seen the inside of your gut should be covered with mucosa and probiotics can help in the production of this keeping the bad guys out of your blood furthermore the epithelial cells lining your colon epithelial means the tissue which lines the services and cavities of your body’s organs and blood vessels have something called adherence sites adherence sites are locations where bacteria can attach themselves once healthy bacteria via probiotics have occupied these positions the harmful bacteria are squeezed out with no place for them to attach themselves finally another of the benefits of probiotics is that they’re great overall at boosting general wellbeing and health even for those who are already in good shape a daily dose of probiotics either as a supplement or in the form of food is a good way to help you maintain a healthily balanced gut ready to defend itself against disease or stress best probiotic yogurt and other probiotics yogurt is an excellent way to get bacteria into your digestive system as it is produced by bacterial fermentation of milk our ancient ancestors fermented milk in this way starting a very long time ago so were in some ways early adopters of probiotics when the bible waxed lyrical about “the land of milk and honey” for instance the “milk” was actually a fermented yogurt and marco polo wrote about kefir a fermented milk drink more details below in his th century travel journals alluding to what he called their “magical properties” by definition all yogurt is produced by bacteria but does that mean all yogurt contains bacteria two types of bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus thankfully usually abbreviated to l bulgaricus and s thermophilus are used to turn milk into yogurt via fermentation but that doesn’t necessarily mean they end up in the products you purchase in the store you see some manufacturers heattreat their yogurt after the fermentation process to give it a longer shelflife in the process however the bacteria  both good and bad  get killed off so the first thing to look for in yogurt is the wording “live and active cultures” in addition it’s best to avoid yogurts which have lots of additives in the form of sugar flavors and coloring generally the shorter the ingredients list the better the yogurt will be for you l bulgaricus and s thermophilus are both regarded to some degree as having probiotic qualities although it’s not absolutely clear that they are able to survive the stomach before reaching your gut some commercially available yogurts have other species of probiotic bacteria added to them in addition to l bulgaricus and s thermophilus which are automatically in all live yogurts sold in the us it can’t be called yogurt if it doesn’t contain those two a few to look out for are b animalis lactis appears to lower inflammation b lactis may help with irritable bowel syndrome and l casei possible improvements to the gut barrier system overall for the best probiotic yogurt it’s probably advisable to choose unsweetened unflavored products adding your own sweetener eg honey or flavor fruit for example foods with probiotics since everybody eats wouldn’t it be wonderful if the food you consumed also helped to top up your microbiome’s good bacteria wouldn’t it be great if foods with probiotics could form part of your routine daily diet well the good news is they can before there was refrigeration foodstuffs could be made to last longer through the process of fermentation think about foods such as sauerkraut and yogurt made respectively from fermented cabbage and milk both keep for a long time let’s run through a few of the most widely available foods with probiotics then and we’ll start with dairy products as we’ve already seen certain types of yogurt as long as they contain live cultures can be a terrific source of healthy bacteria buttermilk is the liquid left behind when milk is churned to make butter and it contains probiotics cheese is another good place to find probiotics especially if it has been aged for a lengthy period in addition to the naturally occurring bacteria which form as part of the manufacturing process some cheese makers also deliberately add other probiotics to their products kefir is an ancient type of the dairy foods with probiotics as we’ve seen marco polo and his crew were drinking it way back in the th century and some say it’s what kept his men alive when others perished kefir is a fermented milk drink which tends to contain more bacterial strains than yogurt in addition to dairy foods probiotics can also be found in items which have been fermented but just as with yogurt it’s important to steer clear of products that have been heattreated as this kills off the bacteria look for sauerkraut in the supermarket even better make your own same goes for kombucha kimchi is a spicy korean type of sauerkraut kimchi and sauerkraut are both made from fermented cabbage and both are good probiotic sources miso made from fermented grains and beans is a japanese seasoning used in cooking to ensure its probiotic qualities however it needs to be added to hot dishes after cooking as heat kills bacteria whether they are good or bad be conscious once again of heat when it comes to choosing pickles another fine source of foods with probiotics pickles which are cucumbers fermented in vinegar usually contain probiotics unless they have been pasteurized a preserving process using high temperatures finally tempeh is another useful probiotic food it’s a highprotein product made from fermented whole soy beans not to be confused with tofu however look for one or two probioticscontaining foods every time you do your grocery shopping and you won’t go far wrong are there side effects to probiotics although it seems clear that probiotics can offer many benefits it’s also important of course to know whether or not there are probiotics side effects according to the us national center for complementary and integrative health the safety of probiotics depends largely on your state of health in general probiotics have a good safety record in people who are largely healthy if side effects occur at all they usually only consist of mild digestive symptoms such as gas however some reports suggest a link between probiotics and severe side effects in people who have some preexisting serious medical conditions these side effects may include the possibility of infections four types of people are most at risk from the severe side effects of probiotics  patients who are critically ill  patients who have recently had surgery  infants who are very sick  people with weakened compromised immune systems if you are generally in good health probiotics should be completely safe to take but if you have any doubts at all it’s sensible to seek the advice of your healthcare provider and that’s particularly so if you plan to make significant changes to your dietary regime some probiotics have shown promise in research but strong evidence supporting their use for specific health conditions is lacking probiotic products that are consumed as dietary supplements are manufactured and regulated as foods rather than as drugs the us food and drug administration fda has so far not approved any probiotics for treating or preventing any health problem what’s more some experts warn that the rapid growth in probiotics use and their marketing may be outpacing scientific research for many of their proposed benefits and uses subscribe for science tidbits like this onceweek references health benefits of probiotics  the british journal of nutrition gastric acid wiki lactobacillus acidophilus wiki

the future meals will be designed according to each individual’s mix of gut bacteria and consumers will choose their facial creams based on an analysis of the microorganisms in their skinthat future is just around the corner thanks in large part to innovations at ubiome inc the san franciscobased company ms richman cofounded four years ago the company uses nextgeneration dna sequencing to give consumers and healthcare professionals greater insights into the microorganisms – collectively known as microbiome – in their bodies “a microbiome is an environment – microbiota is actually the technical term for it – populated by microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and viruses” says ms richman ceo of ubiome the company offers testing kits – available in consumer and clinicalgrade versions – for bacteria in the gut mouth nose skin and genitals“at ubiome we started with  microbiome samples and we now have  which is the largest data set in the world for human microbiome what that means is we can find insights on the microbiome that no one else can”the firm’s technology is among a wave of innovations expected to transform the way people take care of themselves by providing dnabased analyses of their bodies’ systems the emergence of these futuristic technologies ms richman says sets the stage for truly personalized health carebig data and citizen science are used to inform ubiome analyses how does the citizen science part of this workthe idea with citizen science is that you don’t have to have a phd or work in a research institution to do science a good example of citizen science at work is in the field of ornithology where they use amateur birdwatchers to help gather data on birdsat ubiome we basically have people doing experiments on themselves and then use the data they’ve gathered to help answer their questions the experiments range from quite serious to quite silly on the serious side there are those people who want to test their hypothesis on what might improve their gut biome – like if they take probiotics or do elimination diet will that lower the gut inflammation then there are the fun experiments like people sampling the bacteria on their kitchen counter or sampling their babies just to see how their microbiome changes as they growand what kind of insights would they gain from these experimentsfor people who do the fivesite test – where they sample the nose mouth skin gut and genitals – they might learn that their microbiome is similar to a particular group of people with particular hygiene habits or oral concernswhat’s the point of this type of informationfirst of all we don’t provide disease diagnosis so we can’t for example say you are prone to gum disease but we can give people statistics about their microbiome that they can take to their dentist to discuss possible interventions we do provide more indepth analyses for our medicalgrade product such as identifying if a patient microbiome falls within a healthy range and what specific conditions and infections are associated with certain pathogens and microbeswhat are other applications for microbiome testingthere are a lot of business opportunities for collaboration to take this big data set and use them to build products we’re currently working with a fortune  cosmetics company that has asked us to help them develop a diagnostic for skin cream so our test would look at specific bacteria in skin and then based on the results the consumer would know they belong to a specific type of skin biome and that this specific skin cream is the best for their skin biome we’re doing similar things with food companies such as yogurt companies it’s really cool because it gives us this extra reach into other industrieslooking far into the future where do you see microbiome testing in the healthcare ecosystemi see the integration of microbiome testing into our lives i see everyone getting their microbiome tested and this will lead to them getting more personalized products and services imagine having a customized meal kit based on your microbiomeif your results show that your microbiome isn’t very diverse the kit would be customized to include foods like broccoli which promotes beneficial bacteria so the food you eat will actually be scientifically chosen and optimized for your health i also think the medical side will have serious applications that can really help people who are suffering from things like chronic gut condition some of these people suffer for years – microbiome testing can help their doctors diagnose and treat
