test the nelsondenny measures vocabulary development comprehension and reading rate part i vocabulary is a fifteenminute timed test part ii comprehension and rate is a twentyminute test the first minute of the comprehension test is used to determine reading rate including the time needed to distribute materials complete the name and information grids and provide directions the nelsondenny may be administered in fortyfive minutes or a single class period the nelsondenny reading test aids in accurate placement of high school and college students at all reading levels provides comprehension passages drawn from widely used high school and college texts includes a vocabulary section that focuses on words students need for success in todays classrooms offers optional extendedtime administration to meet the needs of special populations eliminates racial and gender bias includes national norms for high schools and twoand fouryear colleges a unique feature of the  edition is the extendedtime administration of the test to meet the needs of special populations such as students with english as a second language or as a foreign language or returning adults the  edition of the nelsondenny reading test forms g and h is the current edition of this widely used high school and college test all test items and reading passages are exclusive to this edition and appear in a test format similar to that used in earlier editions the basic test format was retained because of its wide acceptance by test users other changes from previous editions include a reduction in the number of vocabulary items from  to  and inclusion of seven rather than eight reading comprehension passages with a total of  rather than  items these changes advance a trend in recent nelsondenny forms away from speediness and toward measurement of reading power forms forms g and h are parallel forms that have been equated and can be used interchangeably as pretests and posttests the equating study linking them is described in the technical report an equating study of form g and form e links forms g and h to the earlier forms e and f thus data for students previously tested with form e or f can be related to data provided by form g or h form gform e equating data and tables are provided in the manual for scoring and interpretation scoring scoring the scores available for vocabulary comprehension and total are raw scores scale scores gradeequivalent scores normal curve equivalent scores national percentile ranks and national stanines the reading rate is reported in words per minute the scoring key and procedures for obtaining all scores are included in the manual for scoring and interpretation standardization and norms the national standardization and norming of the nelsondenny reading test was completed during the  school year norms are available for high school and two and fouryear colleges special norms are available for the extendedtime administration and for

present invention relates to dental products comprising cyclodextrins  dental plaque is present to some degree in the form of a film on virtually all dental surfaces it is a byproduct of microbial growth and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix the microorganisms present in plaque are mainly coccoidal organisms particularly in early plaque as plaque ages and matures gram negative anaerobes and filamentous organisms appear and become more common after a few days plaque itself adheres to dental surfaces and may not be removed completely even with a rigorous brushing regimen and can build up for example in recessed areas of tooth surfaces such as approximal regions and fissures moreover plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed  plaque may form on any part of the tooth surfaces and can be found particularly at the gingival margin in pits and fissures in the enamel and on the surface of dental calculus the danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually contribute to gingivitis periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease as well as dental caries and dental calculus  more specifically dental plaque is a precursor to the formation of the hard crystalline build up on teeth referred to as dental calculus both the bacterial and the nonbacterial components of plaque mineralize to form calculus which comprises mineralized bacteria as well as organic constituents such as epithelial cells live bacteria salivary proteins leukocytes and crystalline substances containing both calcium and phosphorous eg hydroxyapatite capooh octacalcium phosphate cahpopoho brushite cahpoho and whitlockite which is considered to have the formula βcapo dental plaque and hence calculus are particularly prone to form at the gingival margin ie the junction of the tooth and gingiva the buildup of plaque at and below the gingival margin is believed to be the prime cause of gingivitis and periodontal disorders  mouthwashes have been formulated to contain antimicrobial ingredients whose function is to reduce the buildup of plaque either by the direct bactericidal action ie killing on plaque and salivary microorganisms and by bacteriostatic action ie growth inhibition on plaque and salivary microorganisms

useful in oral compositions have low aqueous solubilities which limit their use in oral compositions and they require high levels of either  alcohol  surfactants or  cosolvents or combinations of the above for sufficient solubility in the carrier pct appin no wo   for example thymol has been used as a anthelmintic and antiseptic in mouthwashes containing a combination of menthol methyl salicylate eucalyptol and thymol however these compositions are characterized by their relatively high alcohol levels which causes them to have negative aesthetics including excessive “bite” and “burn”  triclosan ′trichloro′hydroxydiphenyl ether is a phenolic nonionic antimicrobial agent used in various soap and toiletry products in the oral care area triclosan has been used as a plaqueinhibitory

antimicrobial compounds as a result of higher levels of solubilized phenolics in a solution the phenolic compounds have improved bioavailability in treating plaque as well as providing compositions having excellent lowtemperature stability these compositions retard the development of plaque as well as treat gingivitis and periodontal diseases without the use of high alcohol levels high surfactant levels or the use of other cosolvents  phenolics useful as antimicrobials in the present invention and effective in treating microorganisms present in the oral cavity of a mammal include menthol methyl salicylate eucalyptol thymol and triclosan thymol and triclosan are generally considered to have the best antimicrobial activity of these phenolics for oral rinses phenolic compounds or mixtures thereof preferably range from about  by weight to about  by weight more preferably from about  by weight to about  by weight for dentifrices the amount of phenolic compounds or a mixture thereof preferably range from about  by weight to about  by weight more preferably from about  by weight to about  by weight  molecules or functional groups of molecules having molecular dimensions that match the cyclodextrin cavity being less hydrophilic ie more hydrophobic than water will position themselves in the cyclodextrin cavity at the expense of water molecules in aqueous solutions the slightly apolar cyclodextrin cavity is occupied by water molecules which are energetically unfavored polarapolar interaction and are therefore readily substituted by appropriate “guest molecules” which are less polar than water in the case of the present invention the “guest molecules” are the phenolic ingredients mentioned above  suitable cyclodextrins useful in the present invention include hydroxypropyl βcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl βcyclodextrin hydroxypropyl γcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl γcyclodextrin acyclodextrin and methyl βcyclodextrin suitable candidate cyclodextrins typically have to have an aqueous solubility of at least about  by weight and form sufficiently soluble phenoliccyclodextrin complexes to be suitable for this invention hydroxypropyl βcyclodextrin is the preferred cyclodextrin  each of the seven cyclic glucopyranose units in βcyclodextrin contains three hydroxyl groups in the  and positions which can be etherified in the case of the partially etherified cyclodextrin derivatives used in this invention only some of these positions are substituted with hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl groups a wide range of substitutions can be made per molecule up to a maximum of  the preferred range of substitution ranges from about  to  positions thus hydroxypropyl βcyclodextrin is a chemically modified cyclodextrin consisting of an amorphous isomeric mixture of thousands of geometric and optical isomers with varying degrees of substitution and varying numbers of hydroxypropyl substituents however the size of the cyclodextrin cavity is constant for these isomers  for oral rinses these amount of soluble cyclodextrin ranges from about  by weight to about  by weight preferably from about  by weight to about  by weight more preferably from about  by weight to about  by weight selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl βcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl βcyclodextrin hydroxypropyl γcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl γcyclodextrin αcyclodextrin methyl βcyclodextrin and mixtures thereof are useful for the invention for dentifrices the amount of soluble cyclodextrin ranges from about  by weight to about  by weight preferably from about  by weight to about  by weight selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl βcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl βcyclodextrin hydroxypropyl γcyclodextrin hydroxyethyl γcyclodextrin αcyclodextrin methyl βcyclodextrin and mixtures thereof are useful for the invention  for dentifrice compositions suitable abrasives include precipitated silica or silica gels which have an average particle size ranging from about  to about  microns preferred silica abrasives include those marketed under the tradename “sylodent®” or “syloid®” by the w r grace  co and those marketed under the tradename “zeodent®” by the j m huber corp other suitable abrasives having a suitable particle size as described above include βphase calcium pyrophosphate alumina and calcium carbonate the amount of abrasive in a dentifrice composition ranges up to about  by weight preferably from  by weight to  by weight  dentifrice and oral rinse compositions also may contain a suitable fluoride source typical sources include soluble salts of the fluoride ion eg sodium fluoride potassium fluoride stannous fluoride stannous fluorozirconate etc or soluble salts of the monofluorophosphate ion eg sodium monofluorophosphate etc the preferred fluoride source is sodium fluoride the fluoride ion source should be sufficient to provide from about  ppm to about  ppm fluoride preferably from about  ppm to about  ppm for dentifrices and from

crying out quotgod be merciful to me the sinnerthe world is full of lustful feeding stations just think of your average day how much of it is filled with the worlds view of sexuality how much of that is willfully entertained by your will men are bombarded with fleshly images from our tvs grocery story magazine racks billboards internet news etc the christian man does not need to visit the local porn shop or massage parlor to feed lust just walking through the local grocery store a mans visuals are bombarded with seminude women at the exit counter to lingerie ads hanging down in the islesvictory will begin for a sexual addict when he realizes that he cannot obtain freedom on his own this recognition allows god to work giving hope and encouragement the battle overcoming the flesh will be a long and hard one a person who has lived for years indulging in sexual sin will take time to recover sanctification in all areas will not be instantaneous but will comprise of a faith road in order that quotthe righteousness of god is progressively revealed from his faith to our faithquot rom  i believe that the bondage of sexual sin like most other sin can be broken quite easily if a
