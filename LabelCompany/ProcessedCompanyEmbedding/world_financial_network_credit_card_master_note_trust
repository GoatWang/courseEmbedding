for the trust a deterioration of comenity bank or comenity servicing llc may affect the performance of series c some of the outstanding subordinate tranches of world financial network credit card master note trust may be able to support higher ratings based on the output of fitchs proprietary cash flow model since the credit card program is set up as a continuous funding program and requires that any new issuance does not affect the rating of existing tranches the enhancement levels are set to maintain a constant rating level per class of issued notes and may provide more than the minimum enhancement necessary to retain issuance flexibility therefore fitch may decide not to assign or maintain ratings above the current outstanding ratings in anticipation of future issuances criteria variations eligible investments fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness as per the report counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated sept   the definition of eligible investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest are monthly collections and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of one month given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned eligible institution fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness as per the report counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated sept   the supplemental indenture for wfn b requires a trust account bank only to maintain at least investmentgrade ratings by fitch bbb which does not meet the fitch counterparty criteria for a aaasf rated note since us bank na as account bank is currently rated aafstable outlook fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card assetbacked securities transactions  increased defaults  a reduction in purchase rate and  a combination stress of higher defaults and lower monthly payment rate mpr increasing defaults alone has little impact on rating migration except in the most severe scenario of a  increase in defaults which could result in downgrades the rating sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate is less pronounced with no rating migration even in the severe scenario the harshest scenario assumes increased defaults and reduced mpr simultaneously all classes could be downgraded under the moderate stress of a  increase in defaults and  reduction in mpr use of thirdparty due diligence pursuant to sec rule g form abs due diligencee was not provided to or reviewed by fitch in relation to this
