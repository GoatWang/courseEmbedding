kustron simplefill inc has raised  million from investors to demonstrate its natural gas compressors with two customers that operate small fleets of cngpowered vehicles the equity raise from  investors will fund the columbus startup’s six to ninemonth pilot program ceo rob underhill said enlarge simplefill ceo rob underhill jack kustron the two companies were not identified “we want to prove that it’s a deployable technology” underhill told me “we’re in a good spot right now we’re focused very heavily on developing our product” simplefill makes compressors that turn natural gas into a cleaner cheaper source of fuel – compared to gasoline – for cars and lightduty trucks the company says its technology born out of ohio state university’s center for automotive research is more efficient than other “expensive unreliable and inefficient compressors that can cost millions of dollars” simplefills compressor is made mostly from massproduced industrial hardware that doesn’t require custom manufacturing “which should drive the cost down underhill said “we have quite a bit of interest in our product even with gas prices being low” he said “there’s no question that there’s a market pullback and not everybody is jumping on the bandwagon like when gas was  a gallon but i think a lot of fleets have realized this is more of a temporary setback” underhill said the  million raise also allows the company to grow to four employees from two including himself simplefill last year raised  through convertible notes as well as an undisclosed amount from ohio state’s technology concept fund underhill has said the company will serve smaller fleets  vehicles or less from for example a carpetcleaning company  than the typical large fleets that currently use cng simplefills
