and filers of abbreviated biologics license applications “ablas” holding that  a reference product sponsor is not entitled to injunctive relief under federal law for an applicant’s refusal to provide

janssen v celltrion damages “patent dance” may determine availability of lost profits by thomas wintner joseph rutkowski  megan y yung on march   posted in biosimilars  biologics life science patent litigation on march   the united states district court for the district of massachusetts issued an order in janssen v celltrion explaining that an accused patent infringer’s failure to fully engage in the biologics price competition and innovation act “bpcia” “patent dance” information exchange process may expose the biosimilar maker to eventual infringement damages in the form of lost profits and preclude limiting damages to a reasonable royalty  janssen biotech inc et al v celltrion healthcare co ltd et al cv d mass  janssen sued celltrion for patent infringement under the bpcia following the fda’s acceptance of celltrion’s abbreviated biologics license application “abla” for a biosimilar version of janssen’s remicade infliximab  in the course of litigation celltrion moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing  based on janssen’s alleged failure to add a necessary party  to guide the parties’ settlement negotiations the court sought to clarify whether in the event the action was dismissed and janssen was forced to refile the complaint with the proper plaintiffs janssen would be prevented from seeking lost profits damages under the bpcia continue reading janssen v

 joseph rutkowski on march   posted in court of appeals for the federal circuit ip litigation patent litigation us courts of appeal on march   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit reaffirmed in a precedential opinion that prosecution disclaimers may only limit the scope of a claim where the disclaimer is “both clear and unmistakable to one of ordinary skill in the art” in technology properties ltd v huawei technologies co ltd the federal circuit made clear that statements made during patent prosecution will not constitute a disclaimer of claim scope where the statements are “ambiguous or amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations” but that a disclaimer based on unambiguous statements during prosecution may serve to surrender more claim scope than was necessary to overcome a rejection continue reading federal circuit reiterates that patent prosecution disclaimers must be “clear and unmistakable” supreme court declines to revisit broad personal jurisdiction over anda filers by adam samansky  joseph rutkowski on january   posted in hatchwaxman life science united states supreme court on monday january   the us supreme court denied without comment mylan pharmaceuticals’ petition for certiorari to reverse an opinion by the court of appeals for the federal circuit which affirmed a broad scope of personal jurisdiction over generic anda filers in patent infringement suits under the hatchwaxman act continue reading supreme court declines to revisit broad personal jurisdiction over anda filers federal circuit finds personal jurisdiction over mylan in two hatchwaxman appeals by adam samansky  joseph rutkowski on march   posted in court of appeals for the federal circuit hatchwaxman on friday march  the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed two district of delaware rulings that nonresident defendant generic anda filer mylan is subject to personal jurisdiction in two hatchwaxman suits filed in the state  see acorda therapeutics inc v mylan pharmaceuticals inc no ‐‐lps d del jan   astrazeneca ab v mylan pharmaceuticals inc no ‐‐gms d del nov    for coverage of the oral argument in these appeals see our prior blog post  the federal circuit found that specific personal jurisdiction exists over mylan in delaware because mylan’s anda filings reliably indicate its intent to engage in actions that will harm plaintiffs’ patent rights in the jurisdiction  the court did not reach the issue on appeal of whether mylan’s compliance with delaware’s registration statute established consent to general personal jurisdiction in the state an issue on which the lower court opinions split  however judge kathleen m o’malley concurring in the majority’s judgement would also have found mylan consented to general personal jurisdiction in light of delaware’s interpretation of its registration statute filing an anda satisfies the minimum contacts requirement of specific personal jurisdiction the court held that “the particular actions mylan has already taken–its anda filings–for the purpose of engaging in that injurycausing and allegedly wrongful marketing conduct in delaware” satisfy the minimum contacts with delaware required to establish specific personal jurisdiction  the court began by observing that if mylan had already begun the generic drug marketing activities for which it seeks permission by filing an anda “there is no doubt that it could be sued for infringement in delaware” and elsewhere that it seeks to market the generic anda products  mylan’s anda filings in turn are “formal acts that reliably indicate plans to engage in” that same infringing activity  thus the anda filings like the contemplated marketing acts they seek approval for establish personal jurisdiction over mylan in delaware continue reading federal circuit finds personal jurisdiction over mylan in two hatchwaxman appeals bpcia patent litigation webinar recap by thomas wintner joseph rutkowski  matthew show phd on march   posted in biosimilars  biologics patent litigation our biosimilar webinar series continued this month with tom wintner’s bpcia patent litigation presentation tom discussed the general framework of litigation under the biologics price competition and innovation act “bpcia” including the “patent dance” information exchange under  usc §l and three case studies that inform our current understanding of emerging judicial interpretation of bpcia requirements for those who missed the webinar some of the key takeaways include the following biosimilar litigation is ultimately about patent litigation but much of the underlying patent issues have been obscured because current litigation focuses on when and how the bpcia applies and the bpcia’s requirements when it does apply continue reading bpcia patent litigation webinar recap biosimilars and fda regulatory webinar recap by joseph rutkowski on february   posted in biosimilars  biologics mintz levin’s biosimilar webinar series continued this month with linda bentley and joanne hawana’s biosimilars fdaregulatory overview presentation on the biologics price competition and innovation act “bpcia” and its implementation some of the key takeaways include overviews of fda guidance on demonstrating biologic product biosimilarity and “interchangeability” the latter of which means that the biosimilar may be substituted for the fdaapproved reference product without intervention by the prescribing health care provider fda’s “stepwise” approach to determining biosimilarity under which more robust initial comparative evidence may reduce fda clinical study requirements later on current state of fda draft product labeling guidance that would require for example reference products and biosimilars to share a common core name with unique suffixes and exclusivity periods for original reference and biosimilar products for a more detailed writeup of the presentation see our post on mintz levin’s health law  policy
