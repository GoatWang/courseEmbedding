that of the receiving water by ³ °c slowly equilbrate the eggs to the receiving temperature by pouring receiving water gently over the eggs until the difference is less than °c disinfect the eggs in accordance with local regulations following disinfection rinse the eggs gently but thoroughly in running water at the receiving temperature before placing them in incubators  incubation  hatch in a verticallystacked heath type incubator system stock no more than  eggs in a single tray preferably in a single layer adjust water flow to  lmin and maintain eggincubation temperature at °c clean the

and gradually increase water temperature to a maximum of °c when the yolk sac is fully absorbed increase water flow rate to  lmin aquadvantage salmon grow very rapidly at this life stage for maximum growth performance use freshwater flowthrough rather than recirculation until they are feeding well maintain a hour light cycle and feed to satiety at least once per hour using automated feeders and appropriate pellet size which will change several times during the first  months if capabilities do not allow for optimum conditions  feed fry to satiety a minimum of six times and preferably once per hour during operational daylength in either scenario flush excess feed from tanks at least three times per day observe fry carefully during this period for any change in behavior which could indicate a deterioration of culture conditions that might lead to unnecessary mortality grade fry earlier and more often than would be typical for atlantic salmon at least three gradings during the first few months are highly recommended  growout  processing transfer fry to larger tanks for growout at a body weight consistent with established practices to optimize growth performance maintain dissolved oxygen content at a minimum value of  mgl and stocking density at a value less than the maximum sustainable under local culture conditions feed fish to satiety a minimum of twice per day according to
