of decay of peroxynitrite in humans suffering from the disease comprising per dosage unit an effective amount of a metal complex for the decomposition of peroxynitrite wherein the metal complex is as defined in claim  description technical fieldthe present invention is for methods of use for the decomposition of peroxynitrite by metal complexes novel pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use therefor particularly the present invention now provides a method for treating selected diseases comprising the decomposition of peroxynitrite with the use of a compound which is a metal complex this decomposition preferably produces benign agents preventing formation of deleterious decomposition products such as oxygen radicals and which also further prevents inactivation of superoxide dismutase sod by the presence of peroxynitrite therefore the method of use for selected metal complexes of the present invention as well as novel pharmaceutical compositions for such use is for the treatment of diseases advantageously affected by treatment comprising decomposition of peroxynitrite at a rate accelerated over a natural background rate of decay which comprises administration of an rateaccelerating effective amount of the metal complex in unit dosage form in other words the methods of treatment and novel compositions of this invention provide a twofold benefit in the treatment of diseases  accelerated rate of catalytic decomposition of peroxynitrite and  protection of sod against inactivation by peroxynitrite thus the present invention provides for a method of treatment of human diseases advantageously affected by such decomposition by protection from the deleterious effects resulting from the presence of peroxynitrite in the human body not heretofore known in addition since protection against sod inactivation is provided such decomposition offers protection against diseases associated with the overproduction of superoxide these diseases include ischemic reperfusion injuries such as stroke head trauma and myocardial ischemia sepsis chronic or acute inflammation such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and the like adult respiratory distress syndrome cancer bronchopulmonary dysplasia side effects from drug treatment of cancer cardiovascular diseases diabetes not included for treatment by vanadium porphyrin complexes multiple sclerosis parkinsons disease familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and colitis and specific neuronal disorders preferably ischemic reperfusion inflammation sepsis multiple sclersis parkinsons disease and stroke background art nitric oxide no is known for its dual physiological role as helpful messenger and harmful intermediate nitric oxide is shown to be generated in numerous cell types including macrophages neutrophils hepatocytes and endothelial cells see hibbs et al science  rimele et al j pharmacol exp ther    curran et al j exp med    and plamer et al nature    respectively the chemical reaction responsible for the production of no is catalyzed by a class of enzymes referred to as nitric oxide synthases nos which convert larginine to citrulline and no forstermann et al biochemical pharmacology   while the role of no as a signaling molecule in the stimulation of guanylate cyclase is well established monocada et al pharmacological reviews    the origins of its cytoxicity remained unclear recently a body of compelling evidence surfaced which teaches that no by itself may not be responsible for cell damage see absts of st annual mtg of oxygen society nov   charleston sc nitric oxide requires superoxide to exert bactericidal activity by l brunnelli and j s beckman instead a more reactive species peroxynitrite produced by the reaction of superoxide and no is found to play a role in the cytotoxicity observed with the overproduction of no peroxynitrite is known to decompose via a process which is first order in protons the rate of proton catalyzed decomposition of peroxynitrite hereinafter the natural background rate of decay is understood from its study over a variety of ph ranges see keith et al j chem soc a p  when the ph is  and the temperature is maintained at ° c the observed rate for the decomposition of peroxynitrite is × seci see beckman et al proc natl acad sci usa vol  pp  beckman shows that peroxynitrite decomposition generates a strong oxidant with reactivity similar to hydroxyl radical as assessed by the oxidation of deoxyribose or dimethyl sulfoxide with the further suggestion that superoxide dismutase protects vascular tissue stimulated to produce superoxide and no under pathological conditions by preventing the formation of peroxynitrite see beckman et al apparent hydroxyl radical production by peroxynitrite implications for endothelial injury from nitric oxide and superoxide in proc natl acad sci usa vol  pp  february  further it is well established that peroxynitrite decomposes to give the hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide a potent nitrating agent both of these species are potent oxidants shown to react with lipid membrane and sulfhydryl moieties see radi et al peroxynitrite oxidation of sulfhydryls in the journal of biological chemistry vol  no  march  pp   hardy et al suggest the interaction of o with nitric oxide forms peroxynitrite or the protonation of o to form perhydroxyl radical is involved

in the experimental biology section of faseb on mar apr   in new orleans la in other words harmful products from peroxynitrite decomposition is specifically taught by many references in addition it has been shown that the reaction of peroxynitrite with mn and fe sod results in inactivation of the enzyme see also radi et al arch biochem biophys    it is now known that peroxynitrite will also inactivate cuzn sod thus the effects of the decomposition of peroxynitrite whether by the generation of damaging decomposition products or inactivation of sod in a wide variety of diseases are well documented for example a study assessing the deleterious effects of peroxynitrite on the rat colon is reported by rachmilewitz et al in peroxynitriteinduced rat colitis a new model of colonic inflammation from gastroenterology    beckman et al in pctus corresponding to us pat no  teach specifically that peroxynitrite is formed by the reaction of superoxide o and nitric oxide in tissues

neuroscience washington d d nov   and abstracted in society for neuroscience abstracts    and biosis  further by preventing inactivation of sod by reducing the presence of peroxynitrite the present invention also provides enhancement of known physiological benefits of superoxide dismutase in the treatment of diseases based on such benefits in this regard sod and its mimics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of diseases for the inhibition of an overproduction of superoxide and nitric oxide thus the present invention relates to the known treatment for diseases by sod and sod mimics the beckman et al pct application also teaches that sods catalyze the dismutation of the oxygen radical superoxide and provides references which show sod and variants thereof have been commonly utilized to prevent or reduce oxidation injury in the treatment of stroke and head trauma myocardial ischemia abdominal vascular occlusion cystitis and a variety of inflammatory conditions beckman et

isomers as well as in the form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof the optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically active acid examples of appropriate acids are tartaric diacetyltartaric dibenzoyltartaric ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts a different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting one or more secondary amine groups of the compounds of the invention with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate the synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography distillation crystallization or sublimation and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure ligand the optically active compounds of the invention can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials such as natural amino acids to screen metal complexes for peroxynitrite decomposition

state either caused by the presence of a peroxynitrite of caused by the lack of the protective presence of the sod enzyme such as in a myocardial infarct stroke or an autoimmune disease these latter
