david mcl williams  gorman  williams pro hac vice michael raymond naccarato  gorman  williams pro hac vice  vanessa maria dsouza  garvey smith nehrbass  north llc order and reasons lance m africk district judge before the court is a motion filed by defendant american cruise lines inc american cruise lines to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for the following reasons the motion is granted in part with leave to amend and denied in part background plaintiff great northern  southern navigation co llc dba french america line great northern intends to operate an inland waterway steamship cruise service in the united states under the trade name french america line to that end great northern has purchased and is preparing to renovate a steamship applied for federal service marks for french america line registered for a louisiana service mark for french america line and created a website advertising the french america line steamship service great northern has even selected a macaron supplier—ladurée—for its service the complaint alleges that the maiden steamship voyage is scheduled for late summer  though defendants attach evidence to their reply brief that the precise date is now october   defendant american cruise lines owns the service mark american cruise lines after hearing of great northerns plan to offer cruises under the french america line name american cruise lines sent great northerns chairman a cease and desist letter in april  the letter demanded that great northern immediately i cease all use of name and trademark french america line    either alone or in connection with other wording ii delete all references to french america line    from your companys website including but not limited to references at wwwfrenchamericalinecom and iii discard all print materials advertisements and other materials bearing that name if any we also demand that you expressly abandon all pending applications for the tradename and mark french america line provided that you agree to these terms in the interest of resolving this matter amicably american would agree to forego claims for past infringement r doc no  at  emphasis added one week later great northern filed this declaratory judgment action asking for declarations that • great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not infringe any of american cruise lines trademark or other federallyprotected rights • great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair or deceptive trade practices • great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair competition american cruise lines now moves to dismiss great northerns complaint on the grounds that the complaint does not present a sufficiently immediate and real controversy to be justiciable law and analysis a legal standards  facial vs factual challenges a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure allows a party to challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court to hear a case ramming v united states  fd   th cir  at the outset the court must emphasize a crucial distinction often overlooked between b motions that attack the complaint on its face and b motions that attack the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact quite apart from any pleadings mortensen v first fed sav  loan assn  fd   d cir  see also b wright  miller federal practice and procedure §  d ed  as many judicial decisions make clear a motion under rule b may be used to attack two different types of jurisdiction defects the fifth circuit has explained a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction rule b can be based on the lack of jurisdiction on the face of the complaint if so the plaintiff is left with safeguards similar to those retained when a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is raised—the court must consider the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true but the two motions are treated quite differently when matter outside the complaint is the basis of the attack williamson v tucker  fd   th cir  citation omitted the court further explained by quoting the third circuit the facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction does offer similar safeguards to the plaintiff the court must consider the allegations of the complaint as true the factual attack however differs greatly for here the trial court may proceed as it never could under b or fed r civ p  because at issue in a factual b motion is the trial courts jurisdiction—its very power to hear the case— there is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case in short no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiffs allegations and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims id at  quoting mortensen  fd at  the district court consequently has the power to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on any one of three separate bases  the complaint alone  the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record or  the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the courts resolution of disputed facts id at  because american cruise liness motion argues both that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to establish jurisdiction and that extrinsic evidence calls into question the allegations of the complaint this court will consider both the allegations in the complaint as well as the seemingly undisputed facts contained in the defendants extrinsic evidence which is largely just print outs of the french america line websites and great northerns pr statements and is not controverted by great northern in its brief to determine whether there was an actual controversy between the parties on the date the complaint was filed  actual controversy requirement both article iii of the constitution as well as the declaratory judgment act require that a party seeking a declaratory judgment demonstrate that there is an actual controversy between the parties at the time the complaint is filed see vantage trailers inc v beall corp  fd   th cir  to do so a plaintiff must show that the dispute is definite and concrete real and substantial and admit of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character id as the supreme court has admitted the cases analyzing the issue have not drawn the brightest of lines medimmune inc v genentech inc  us    nonetheless when examining whether the totality of the circumstances demonstrate an actual controversy relating to intellectual property allegations courts appear to focus primarily on two interrelated issues first in order to ensure that the federal courts are not impermissibly opining on what the law would be on a hypothetical set of facts the proposed product must be fixed with respect to its potentiallyinfringing characteristics vantage trailers  fd at  internal quotation marks omitted however only the potentially infringing aspects of the developing product needs to be fixed—the entire product need not be in final form id at  citing starter corp v converse inc  fd  d cir  second in order to ensure that the plaintiff has a concrete injuryinfact traceable to the defendants conduct courts examine whether the plaintiff is taking meaningful ongoing steps to bring the product or service to market such as producing prototypes or samples of the allegedly infringing products soliciting business from and sending advertising to potential customers or otherwise investing significant funds in preparation to produce the product young v vannerson  fsuppd   sd tex  rosenthal j see also medimmune  us at  n however again an important caveat is in order though a plaintiff is required to be making significant efforts to bring a product to market that neither inexorably requires that the plaintiff have a product on sale nor that the plaintiff be under a reasonable apprehension of being sued see eg klinger v conan doyle estate ltd  fd   th cir  instead the keystone of the inquiry is whether the defendants assertion of legal rights is injuring the plaintiff by coercing the plaintiff into choosing between  ceasing ongoing conduct that the plaintiff believes is lawful or  facing fiscal or legal repercussions see medimmune  us at  b application  request for declaration of federal trademark rights the court concludes that great northern can demonstrate a justiciable controversy because it can show  great northern has settled on a fixed trade name as evidenced by great northerns frenchamericanlinecom website advertising and service mark filings  great northern has expended significant effort and funds in support of a welldefined steamship service whose launch—at least at the speed that the federal courts typically operate—is imminent and  american cruise liness assertion of rights is harming great northern by forcing great northern to choose between risking treble damages medimmune inc  us at  or abandoning its enterprise and selecting another trade name id at  accordingly although american cruise lines objects that great northern has yet to finish renovating its steamboat obtain federal service mark protection and receive all the certificates that are necessary to operate a steamboat service those are not necessary prerequisites to filing a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that great northern does not infringe american cruise liness rights particularly where an impending welldefined service is already being advertised to the public under a particular trade name the law does not require that great northern waste significant resources renovating a steamship—which presumably requires purchasing any number of items bearing the name french america line as well as permanently engraving the name on any number of surfaces—in order to seek a judicial declaration of its ability to use the french america line trade name to run its upmarket frenchthemed riverboat service the court cannot help but note that american cruise liness assertion in its demand letter that american cruise lines has a legal claim against great northern for past infringement is utterly incongruent with american cruise liness present assertion that there is no actual controversy see eg uptown grill llc v shwartz  fd   th cir  suggesting there is an actual controversy when the alleged infringer is actively engaged in conduct that could constitute trademark infringement in addition to determining that great northern has demonstrated an actual controversy between the parties the court also concludes that it has the authority to grant declaratory relief and that the discretionary factors set out in sherwinwilliams co v holmes county  fd   th cir  favor the exercise of this courts discretion to decide whether federal trademark law permits great northern to use the french america line trade name indeed american cruise lines never argues otherwise accordingly the court denies american cruise liness motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction great northerns request for a declaratory judgment that the french america line trade name and service marks does not infringe any of american cruise liness trademark or other federallyprotected rights  requests for declaration of state law rights the court however agrees with american cruise lines that great northern has not demonstrated an actual controversy with respect to its requests for declaratory judgments that  great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair or deceptive trade practice and  great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair competition in particular the court concludes great northerns declaratory judgment requests are so broadly worded—for example they do not even specify which states laws this court is supposed to examine which is far from a trivial issue here given that the proposed great northern service will operate in multiple states—that the complaint leaves the court without the information the court needs to ascertain whether there is an actual controversy after all this court cannot simply issue a declaration that great northerns activities are permitted under some metaphysical state law moreover there may be an actionable controversy between great northern and american cruise lines under the laws of some states but not others given that great northern has the burden of establishing the existence of an actual controversy valcom acquisitions trust v suntrust mortg co  f appx   th cir  the court is of the view that the better course is to dismiss great northerns second and third requests for a declaratory judgment with leave to amend so that great northern can file an amended complaint that sets out which state law controversies great northern is requesting that this court resolve great northern is on notice that any amended complaint should  specify the specific causes of action in specific states for which it is requesting a declaratory judgment and  set out uptodate factual allegations regarding the proposed steamship service conclusion for the foregoing reasons it is ordered that american cruise liness motion is granted in part and denied in part it is further ordered that great northerns request for a declaratory judgment that great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair or deceptive trade practice is dismissed with leave to amend it is further ordered that great northerns request for a declaratory judgment that great northerns use of the french america line trade name and service marks does not violate state law regulating unfair competition is dismissed with leave to amend it is further ordered that remainder of american cruise liness motion is denied footnotes  r doc no   r doc no  ¶  r doc no  at   r doc no  ¶¶   r doc no  ¶   r doc no  ¶
