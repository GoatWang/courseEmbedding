servicing agreement and the special servicer of the providence place mall mortgage loan which constituted approximately  of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cutoff date as a result wells fargo bank national association is a “servicer” as defined in item aiii of regulation ab in the capacities described above because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted  or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cutoff date the assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria accountants’ attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by wells fargo bank national association in the capacities described above are listed in the exhibit index   wells fargo bank national association as master servicer of the subject transaction did not provide an assessment of compliance with respect to item diii at the time the pooling and servicing agreement was entered into it was intended that either the master servicer or the certificate administrator would perform this servicing function in fact item diii of regulation ab was performed by the certificate administrator and is included in the assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation report of the certificate administrator for the subject transaction   with regard to the servicing criteria set forth in subsection diii keybank national association as successor by merger to keycorp real estate capital markets inc has indicated that the criteria is not applicable under the terms of the related pooling and servicing agreement the certificate administrator may and does perform this servicing function and keybank national association understands that the certificate administrator has included this criteria in its own assessment of compliance for this transaction   us bank national association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to item diii of regulation ab regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections cash flows or distributions and any interest or other fees charged for such advances are made reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements however the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there were no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee as was the case during the reporting period covered by this annual report on form k as a result this annual report on form k does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee one or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to item diii of regulation ab   this annual report on form k includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation reports from corelogic commercial real estate services inc and national tax search llc these entities were engaged by the master servicer of the pooling and servicing agreement to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities to report tax amounts due to verify tax parcel information and to verify nonescrow tax payments these services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in items dxi and dxii therefore under the principlesbased definition of “servicer” set forth in item j that looks to the functions that an entity performs these vendors are “servicers” for the purposes of item  see compliance and disclosure interpretations section  item j   part i      item  business omitted item a risk factors omitted item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties
