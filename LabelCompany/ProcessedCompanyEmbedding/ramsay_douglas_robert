illustrated with copperplates by robert douglas esqdouglas robert sir table of contents  add to bookbag  previous section   next section  ramsay parl of dalhotsie antiquaries do not exactly a∣gree about the origin of the illustri∣ous name of ramsay some are of opinion that it came origin∣ally from germany the armorial bearing be∣ing an eagle displayed others with more probability say from england that it is local and was first assum∣ed from the lands and abbacy of ramsay in nottinghameshire c certain it is the ramsays were settled in this country as early as the reign of king da∣vid i who succeeded to the crown of scot∣land anno —and it appears from rymers foedaera angliae and prynnes collec∣tions that there were many considerable fa∣milies in scotland of that sirname long be∣fore the reign of king robert bruce it is evident also from our histories and re∣cords that besides the ramsays in midlo∣thian there were many eminent families of that sirname in fife angus and perthshire in very early times viz the ramsays of co∣luthie carnock corston forthar parbroath auchterhouse balmain banff and many o∣thers some whereof have been hereditary sheriffs of angus sheriffs of fife edinburgh c and have enjoyed the highest offices in the state but whether they are all descend∣ed from the ramsays of dalhousie who are certainly the head or chief of the ramsays in midlothian we shall not pretend to determine but shall proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents from i simon de ramsay who flourished in the reign of king david i and malcom iv and is witness in a grant of the church of li∣vingston page  0 in westlothian by thurstanus fi∣lius livingi to the monastery of holyrood∣house anno 0 he is also witness to a charter in the reign of king malcolm wherein william de mor∣ville constable of scotland grants the lands of gilmorstoun in midlothian eudulpho fi∣lio uthredi c ante  in which year king malcolm died he lived after the year  and left issue a son ii william de ramsay who succeed∣ed him in a charter de libertate ecclesiae de coldinghame confirmed by king william the lyon this william de ramsay duncan earl of fise william de

except when they are locally designed there are no less than nine of that sirname that swore fealty to king ed∣ward i for lands lying in different counties anno  and  and though this sir william was after∣wards obliged to renew the same oathanno 0 yet being convinced in his own mind that an oath imposed by an enemy who had the power in his own hands could not bind him against the interest of his
