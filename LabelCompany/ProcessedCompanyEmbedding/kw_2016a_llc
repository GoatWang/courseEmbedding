your own review of the kdk fm wroi rating  jan    send this review to a friend great mod was availablenbsp time owned more than  months after i had my  for a few years a local ham came up with a scanning adaptation for the kdks and a bunch of other radios this was well before any of the big three had any form of scanning this mod also added one extra memory position like the original radio it could scan looking for either an occupied channel or a vacant channel i think he must have made over  of these kits and one year at the dayton hamvention he did mods right at the booth and in most cases got them back to the owners the same day he took unfinished work back to his motel room and worked into the night to have them ready for the next day a real dedicated guy since he and i were members of the same radio club he did a free install on my radio i went to his house and he dove into my rig and told me how to modify the mike which was involved in the scanstop process a switch had to be added but this did what it had to do with the existing mike wires after the big three started offering various forms of scan options for their rigs he got out of the business his mods also opened the radio up a bit it was possible to tune several mhz below  and almost up to   i found a lot of strange signals up in that range above  after listening to one of them for several months i concluded that it was probably a remote telemetry system reporting something for a utility company but that was just a guess it had cwid and some fsk and some other form of modulation which sounded like pulsed heavy buzzing i was never able to put a directional antenna on the rig to get an idea of where that station was i made a few afsk rtty contacts with it but did not want to keep it in the house so i didnt do much vhf rtty in those days the radio had reasonable sensitivity and i was never bothered by adjacent channel activity and in the detroit area we had and still have a lot of m repeaters if anyone wants more info on this scanner i will be glad to swap emails with them the designer and builder of this has retired from his main job and now lives in arizona i will respect his privacy and not give out his name or call if someone has a real compelling reason i might give their email address to him and let him decide whether or not to contact them i still have my kdk  and fire it up every once in a while and make a few contacts i replaced the tr relay once and aso the memory backup battery i am sure that the battery needs another swap out thanks for reading if you got this far ralph  wroi exwagdt ps eham needs one more category in the time owned block below still owned nbsp kaayr rating  nov    send this review to a friend nice frequency selectionnbsp time owned more than  months i had one of these in the late s someone i know wanted to get rid of his so i jumped on the opportunity to take it a couple of issues  these radios may have to be restored you do that by replacing the electrolytic capacitors they dry out and devalue replace potentiometers that have dead spots once thats done realign the radio and it sounds pretty decent not as advanced or high power as modern radios but no other radio ive had has had such an easy frequency selection scheme radio has concentric knobs to set s and s in khz a  khz on off switch and a mhz select you can change frequencies very fast relive the golden days of fm and repeaters with this neat radio that still has relevance today nbsp zzmde rating  jan    send this review to a friend the kdk its terrificnbsp time owned  to  months i have  kdk radios for me one great experience nbsp zlufi rating  oct    send this review to a friend interesting rignbsp time owned  to  months i brought one of these rigs as a replacement after my ich had been stolen from my car i got it cheap as the ham selling it didnt want much for it i used it mostly mobile and initially didnt get very good reports the main reason for this was that it wouldnt hold the repeaters after speaking on the repeaters i was talked through on the repeater to adjust the deviation this consisted of opening the rig and tuning the pot until the transmitted audio sounded better this in fact ended up in me tuning it as far as it would go the reports i received after this were much better i cant honestly say that i liked the radio that much with the red display and meter that it had it was a real come down from the ich with a led meter and green display plus being fm only it had five memories as well if i recall it correctly all i can say in the end was that it filled the gap while i argued with the insurance company over the value of my lost radio in the end i owned it for some  months while this went on i later sold it for more that i paid in a junk sale wasnt too attached to it when it went never had any other problems besides the deviation as mentioned above i owned it in the mid s  dont recall how old it was when i had it
