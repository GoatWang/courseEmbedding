loophole that eliminates the need to file the t and pay the required ubit tax   disclosing this of course proves reid’s claim regarding him paying no taxes even though he may have used a technically legal scheme  it is unlikely the public will care that romney paid other taxes when he has avoided significant required taxes on bain deals in his largest asset the ira   worse for romney would be

ira leveraged deals lexis academic mark maremont pension plan portfolio companies presidential candidate private equity republican convention republicans retirement age romney ropes  gray sec filings sep ira smtc corporation sprint tax rules taxes trusts ubit unemployment insurance unrelated business income tax wsj on july   with all the stories on romney’s finances many of which resulted from my observations regarding his tax returns and investment accounts in particular his ira and the interaction of the trusts foundation and bain company filings the most important story is still untold here it is the story that could likely open the republican convention to draft a new candidate  i have been unsuccessful in getting a major reporter to tell the story so i guess i’ll just have to tell it myself i’ll lay it out in simple steps with no conclusions or opinions  it is simply astonishing that the media has not told this story   while head of bain capital mitt romney set up a sepira pension plan that allowed employees to invest in bain deals  mark maremont of the wsj did a fine story on this   iras are tax exempt and like other tax exempts must file a special return a t if they are invested in leveraged transactions  this is as straightforward as requiring employers to pay unemployment insurance for employees as part of periodic payroll transactions  the purpose of the t is to recognize the ubit or unrelated business income tax the rate of which approximates the corporate rate of  percent congress adopted this approach for obvious reasons in that if an investor was getting tax exempt income in an ira let’s say interest income on a leveraged debt offering and on the other side of the fence the borrower was taking large interest expense deductions the net impact would be a double deduction and a grossly dysfunctional tax system  bain capital is a leveraged buyout firm in which employees invested in numerous “bain deals” via their ira accounts  these investments are leveraged and clearly subject to ubit tax  other leading private equity firms do not allow employees to invest in their own deals via ira accounts   all t returns including those relating to iras are by law public  one need only make a request to the irs  in april i made such a request for bain and  top executives including romney for their sep iras covering the period   the irs responded none had been filed  in addition i also confirmed no filings were made from  with respect to the new bain capital pension plan set up by ropes and gray in which the official retirement age is  not a misprint   maremont of the wsj also reported on this “unusually young” retirement age   the only way to escape the t requirement and ubit tax is to make the investment through a foreign blocker corporation   domestic corporations are fully subject to the ubit and leading law firms are very careful in structuring partnerships to account for this that is making sure such investments go through a foreign blocker corporation   edgar online is a public corporation ticker edgr effectively controlled by bain capital via a convertible bond issue  sec filings clearly indicate this control summarized in edgar online’s executives own words edgar online is in the business of summarizing  sec data in user friendly formats that are widely used in the financial and media world  many leading databases including lexis academic which is available in most public libraries use edgar online  one need only search for mitt romney using the lexis academic database while specifying a search database of “sec filings” from  to see a list of references   in but one example on february   smtc corp ticker smtx filed a g report on behalf of bain capital  under section item a name of filing person it specifically states that bcip trust associates ii is a delaware partnership not a foreign blocker corporation   this form also states romney is the sole shareholder of bain capital and the only “control person” capable of declaring a special dividend   erisa rules require pension plans to be trusts  for example if i want to set up a pension plan for joe’s consulting with td ameritrade the title for each participant’s account would be joe’s consulting pension trust fbo followed by the employee name  for example joe’s consulting pension trust fbo jane doe would be one employee and joe’s consulting pension trust fbo mitt romney would be another  the reason is to make absolutely certain each employee’s assets are held in and protected by a separate trust which is required by erisa rules in romney’s ira note that he is not invested in bcip associates ii but rather bcip “trust ” associates  the key word “trust” is a calling card for the ira  this can be seen in his recently filed  personal financial disclosure statement  note that the most recent filing shows bcip trust associates iii not ii  trust iii is identified as a foreign blocker in sec filings yet in previous filings romney was in trust ii and its predecessor both domestic delaware corporations   the g filing regarding smtc corporation on behalf of bain referred to in item  of this analysis specifically says bcip trust associates ii is a delaware corporation not a foreign blocker if this sec filing is accurate and it certainly is then not only romney but many other bain employees have failed to file the required t returns and pay the necessary ubit tax   other leading private equity firms including kkr and blackstone do not allow employees to invest in company deals via retirement accounts for good reason  perhaps bain just got too greedy consistent with its fees being  percent higher than the industry average there is a whole cottage industry of law firms that advise tax exempt investors on how to avoid ubit by using foreign blocker corporations  these clients include leading endowments such as harvard and yale foundations such as the gates foundation and public pensions romney says he trusts his advisors yet that was clearly a mistake  they have failed him in not only setting up a valid blind trust but also a credible investment approach for a presidential candidate  see february   blog post for related material and comparison to bill esrey former ceo of sprint more importantly if these filings made by one of bain capital’s portfolio companies smtc and summarized via another entity they effectively control edgar online are accurate then romney is indeed involved in a massive tax fraud and by nature disqualified from being a viable candidate for president this is not

did romneys ira grow so biglynnley browning min readrepublican presidential candidate and former massachusetts governor mitt romney listens during a roundtable discussion about housing issues in tampa florida january  brian snyderreuters  in the wake of news reports last week that presidential contender mitt romney owns an individual retirement account worth as much as  million questions are growing over how it could have gotten so big when contribution limits are capped at  or  a year tax lawyers and accountants suggest an answer romney may have made use of an internal revenue service loophole that allows investors to undervalue interests in investment partnerships when first putting them into an ira these assets can produce returns far in excess of those that could be generated from other investments made at the capped level an investor could even set an initial value for a partnership interest at zero dollars because under tax regulations an interest in a partnership represents future income not current value said chris sanchirico codirector of the center for tax law and policy at the university of pennsylvania law school whether romney used this technique which is legal when he put partnership interests into his ira is a question that wont likely be answered when he discloses his  tax returns on tuesday romneys ira valued at between  million and  million as reported by the wall street journal last thursday holds stakes in  investment entities run by bain capital the privateequity firm he cofounded and led for  years one possibility for its size is that he put his bain partnership interests into the ira and valued them at a very low number said david weisbach a law professor who focuses on tax at the university of chicago law school andrea saul a spokeswoman for the romney campaign declined to respond to emails and calls in the wake of growing scrutiny of his personal wealth romney one of the wealthiest contenders ever for the white house told fox news host chris wallace on sunday that on tuesday he would release his  tax returns and estimates for his  return the release will not provide much insight into his ira that is because a personal incometax return shows ira contributions and withdrawals only for the year of the return and not for previous years and does not show whether any contributions were in the form of undervalued partnership interests while an ira investor can sometimes be required to file a separate return for the ira it is unclear whether romney intends to release any such returns romneys personal financial summary disclosed last august under federal election rules shows that his ira holds his most lucrative investments which are stakes in partnerships run by bain capital those stakes include bcip trust associates iii a bain fund that is his single largest investment with assets valued at  to  bcip trust associates iii produced income to romneys ira of over  over  and through august   according to the summary robert stack head of international tax at law firm ivins phillips  barker said it is possible that romneys ira grew so large not only because of an increase in the value of the funds in which it invests but also through lucrative profits typically  percent of investment gains per year that funds can generate for their general partners it is not known whether romney is a general partner in the bain funds meaning invested in the partnership responsible for managing the funds or simply an investor in the funds the romney campaign has declined to comment on this issue the general partners cut of the profit known as carried interest is taxable each year if the funds in which the ira is invested earn certain management fees or borrow to make their investments tax lawyers say they want to know whether romneys ira holds any carried interest and whether it has paid tax on it  something not disclosed in his personal financial summary or on a federal income tax return in the context of a  million ira that is what we would want to know said david miller a tax lawyer at cadwalader wickersham  taft the average ira held by americans holds  according to the investment company institute a trade group while the romney campaign has said that some of his ira consists of retirement savings rolled over from previous plans accountants say rollovers would not likely explain the size of his ira even if he rolled over a k with the annual caps on contributions youre still only talking about a few million dollars said robert green an accountant who is founder of green trading a tax and accounting firm that caters to the investment industry last year individuals could contribute a maximum of  a year to their k plans tax lawyers say it is also important to know whether romneys ira holds stakes in bain funds directly or through related offshore entities these entities commonly used by taxexempt investors such as romneys ira legally allow the investors to avoid having to pay a special tax known as the unearned business income tax or ubti while the wall street journal suggested on thursday that avoidance of the special tax was a big reason for the size of romneys ira some tax lawyers said that its size might simply reflect the extreme profitability of a carried interest held by the ira the best guess is that he put the carried interest into the ira miller said romneys ira produced income of  million to  million over  and through august   according to his financial summary but it is unknown what if any taxes the ira may have paid on its carried interest saul romneys campaign spokeswoman declined requests for comment reporting by lynnley browning additional reporting by gregory roumeliotis editing by amy stevens eddie evans and carol

sep ira smtc corporation sprint tax rules taxes trusts ubit unemployment insurance unrelated business income tax wsj on july   with all the stories on romney’s finances many of which resulted from my observations regarding his tax returns and investment accounts in particular his ira and the interaction of the trusts foundation and bain company filings the most important story is still untold here it is the story that could likely open the republican convention to draft a new candidate  i have been unsuccessful in getting a major reporter to tell the story so i guess i’ll just have to tell it myself i’ll lay it out in simple steps with no conclusions or opinions  it is simply astonishing that the media has not told this story   while head of bain capital mitt romney set up a sepira pension plan that allowed employees to invest in bain deals  mark maremont of the wsj did a fine story on this   iras are tax exempt and like other tax exempts must file a special return a t if they are invested in leveraged transactions  this is as straightforward as requiring employers to pay unemployment insurance for employees as part of periodic payroll transactions  the purpose of the t is to recognize the ubit or unrelated business income tax the rate of which approximates the corporate rate of  percent congress adopted this approach for obvious reasons in that if an investor was getting tax exempt income in an ira let’s say interest income on a leveraged debt offering and on the other side of the fence the borrower was taking large interest expense deductions the net impact would be a double deduction and a grossly dysfunctional tax system  bain capital is a leveraged buyout firm in which employees invested in numerous “bain deals” via their ira accounts  these investments are leveraged and clearly subject to ubit tax  other leading private equity firms do not allow employees to invest in their own deals via ira accounts   all t returns including those relating to iras are by law public  one need only make a request to the irs  in april i made such a request for bain and  top executives including romney for their sep iras covering the period   the irs responded none had been filed  in addition i also confirmed no filings were made from  with respect to the new bain capital pension plan set up by ropes and gray in which the official retirement age is  not a misprint   maremont of the wsj also reported on this “unusually young” retirement age   the only way to escape the t requirement and ubit tax is to make the investment through a foreign blocker corporation   domestic corporations are fully subject to the ubit and leading law firms are very careful in structuring partnerships to account for this that is making sure such investments go through a foreign blocker corporation   edgar online is a public corporation ticker edgr effectively controlled by bain capital via a convertible bond issue  sec filings clearly indicate this control summarized in edgar online’s executives own words edgar online is in the business of summarizing  sec data in user friendly formats that are widely used in the financial and media world  many leading databases including lexis academic which is available in most public libraries use edgar online  one need only search for mitt romney using the lexis academic database while specifying a search database of “sec filings” from  to see a list of references   in but one example on february   smtc corp ticker smtx filed a g report on behalf of bain capital  under section item a name of filing person it specifically states that bcip trust associates ii is a delaware partnership not a foreign blocker corporation   this form also states romney is the sole shareholder of bain capital and the only “control person” capable of declaring a special dividend   erisa rules require pension plans to be trusts  for example if i want to set up a pension plan for joe’s consulting with td ameritrade the title for each participant’s account would be joe’s consulting pension trust fbo followed by the employee name  for example joe’s consulting pension trust fbo jane doe would be one employee and joe’s consulting pension trust fbo mitt romney would be another  the reason is to make absolutely certain each employee’s assets are held in and protected by a separate trust which is required by erisa rules in romney’s ira note that he is not invested in bcip associates ii but rather bcip “trust ” associates  the key word “trust” is a calling card for the ira  this can be seen in his recently filed  personal financial disclosure statement  note that the most recent filing shows bcip trust associates iii not ii  trust iii is identified as a foreign blocker in sec filings yet in previous filings romney was in trust ii and its predecessor both domestic delaware corporations   the g filing regarding smtc corporation on behalf of bain referred to in item  of this analysis specifically says bcip trust associates ii is a delaware corporation not a foreign blocker if this sec filing is accurate and it certainly is then not only romney but many other bain employees have failed to file the required t returns and pay the necessary ubit tax   other leading private equity firms including kkr and blackstone do not allow employees to invest in company deals via retirement accounts for good reason  perhaps bain just got too greedy consistent with its fees being  percent higher than the industry average there is a whole cottage industry of law firms that advise tax exempt investors on how to avoid ubit by using foreign blocker corporations  these clients include leading endowments such as harvard and yale foundations such as the gates foundation and public pensions romney says he trusts his advisors yet that was clearly a mistake  they have failed him in not only setting up a valid blind trust but also a credible investment approach for a presidential candidate  see february   blog post for related material and comparison to bill esrey former ceo of sprint more importantly if these filings made by one of bain capital’s portfolio companies smtc and summarized via another entity they effectively control edgar online are accurate then romney is indeed involved in a massive tax fraud and by nature disqualified from being a viable candidate for president this is not complicated and hopefully someone will elevate it from the obscurity of a blog to where it belongs front page top right above the fold on a sunday read full post »  august   blackstone group lp –

fleischer blackstone tax volcker wall street never sleeps wayne pressgrove white  case on august   note not copyrighted  this basic post was updated december   given the current debate in congress over extending the bush tax cuts and numerous inquires regarding my position in this debate  the purpose of this post is to highlight that although rates are important perhaps more important are overall fairness issues associated with two situations in particular  put another way why don’t we all forget about the rates and focus on basic fairness first  doing that should allow rates to come down in all brackets with the financial reform package now passed all eyes are on the setting of specific rules regarding its implementation  and while lobbyists attempt to direct the debate away from where it should be let’s instead visit the core issue tax rules this rollout of specific rules related to the volcker rule and related tax considerations will squarely position paul volcker pictured on the lower left below and current irs commissioner doug shulman lower right against blackstone group lp’s steve schwarzman and other leveraged buyout artists operating under the guise of “private equity”  why are tax rules key one might ask especially if these rules have nothing to do with the debate over carried interest this is because two specific tax rules have profoundly shaped the current investment markets via a major impact on cash flow they have also in a more basic fashion functioned as the seeds from which all the other market dysfunctions have originated the purpose of this post is to briefly explain these two rules and then connect the dots  also see related march   post titled blackstone tax engineers inspired by ge attempt to repeal the fractions rule  this post includes brief audio recordings from leading attorneys and an irs official regarding the fractions rule   net operating losses this involves the practice of creating large pools of net operating loss tax deductions mostly from unusable technology firms’ stock option deductions when these firms are bought by private equity funds  these private equity firms then do leveraged buyouts of profitable companies and offset these profitable companies profits into the pool of losses to make the profitable companies tax exempt back in the ’s this loophole was intended to be closed when congress prohibited profitable companies from purchasing such losses and using them all immediately  the new law required they be amortized over several years   as former senate finance chair bob packwood noted in an oregonian article the treasury never foresaw firms escaping the loophole by using partnerships with large pools of losses to purchase profitable companies   essentially the same transaction in reverse who would think that a partnership whose primary asset were losses would be able to purchase profitable companies all that was needed in the legislation to prevent this was the term “and vice versa”  remarkably there has been no discussion of this amazing situation perhaps the biggest tax story in  years   “the fractions rule” this rule was put in place at about the same time and designed to prevent tax exempt entities such as public pensions from trading tax deductions they were not entitled to use with taxable partners  the fractions rule also was designed to discourage tax exempt entities from investing in leveraged buyouts lbo’s via partnerships with private equity firms and other taxable partners   clearly this would give such firms purchased an unfair marketplace advantage when competing with tax paying businesses  or put another way who would be left to pay tax if all the tax paying firms got gobbled up by partnerships in leveraged buyouts fueled with tax exempt investor funds perhaps one of the nations leading attorney regarding the fractions rule sanford presant of greenburgtaurig put it best in a  american bar association meeting when he said  “back then it was tough to get in to our thursday night committee dinners they were by invitation only  boy was it tough to get in to listen to some of these people and their intelligent pearls  the real debates were… can you get  to  writeoffs   to   how do you get  to   everybody was trading on tax benefits and as part of all this backlash we got the fractions rule” presant is pictured below on the left with wayne pressgrove of king and spaulding on the right  these two brilliant lawyers represent the leading private equity and hedge funds in the ensuing years once again the industry has attempted to sidestep the fractions rules intent which applies only to “partnerships” by using blocker “corporations” set up in the cayman islands and other tax havens  as a trained cpa i find this most disappointing since the irs rules should be based upon the “substance” of the economic activity rather than the form or structure  in any event there is a whole cottage industry of law firms selling advice based upon such  blocker corporation schemes a brilliant team of lawyers at king and spaulding helped write the fractions rule and key to it is the expression “and vice versa”  this is key because it would prevent the gamesmanship that has occurred with operating losses noted above put another way it would limit allocating deductions from tax exempt to taxable partners in addition to allocating income from taxable partners to tax exempt partners what surprises many non tax experts is that these special allocation partnerships can have one set of allocation rules for taxable income and deductions and a completely different set of rules for cash flow  the second key aspect of this situation that is creating considerable uneasiness among taxable partners in these partnerships is the rule regarding substantial economic effect that is you can’t be simply moving deductions and income between taxable and tax exempt investors unless the transaction has “substantial economic effect” this is particularly important with compensation the numbers of which can be particularly large with private equity and hedge funds   large cpa firms now have entire divisions focused upon transfer pricing and expense allocations yet again one has to ask the question if these transfers do not have underlying economic effect other than moving deductions around why is this allowed it is somewhat ironic that king and spaulding the same firm that helped draft the fractions rule is now leading an effort via the american bar association to gut the fractions rule by exempting certain key expenses and transactions  one recent king and spaulding partner dan coates was just elected to the us senate and expressed interest in being on the finance committee which oversees these rules via the irs we’ve given up on repealing it all together the aba notes and so we are now trying to be more tactical  this has resulted in the fractions rule becoming what one leading attorney calls the “mariana trench” of the internal revenue code  perhaps it is also why there has been so little enforcement to date from the irs  as noted by curt wilson associate chief counsel in the the office of passthroughts and special industries at the  aba mid year tax section meeting wilson noted i find this surprising especially given the level of angst in industry over compliance with these rules  see my letter to wilson opposing granting this revenue ruling as an investment advisor i find this remarkable given the current debate over extending the bush tax cuts  while smaller llc based businesses pay federal state property and various other forms of taxes and fees it appears that these private equity and hedge funds are skirting the rules and paying close to nothing  this of course introduces a significant fairness issue again the fractions rule specifically limits the trading of tax benefits from tax exempt entities to taxable partners or vice versa  put another way imagine if you were a taxable partner in a partnership and  percent of the other investors were tax exempt entities  imagine how difficult it would be to leave  percent of valuable tax deductions on the table as unusable perhaps this is why gutting the fractions rule is one of the american bar association’s top priorities see aba letter to irs commissioner later in this post it could be argued that some private equity firms have become but a sophisticated shell for tax avoidance based upon a maze of interconnected companies and effectively converted to tax exempt status through the aggressive use of net operating loss tax deductions involving executive compensation and transfer pricing  this has resulted in an unfair competitive advantage against profitable companies that pay taxes  this has also enraged ordinary small business owners who are not using such schemes investors in profitable companies that actually pay taxes get lower returns than they otherwise would have making competing with such a scheme on a long term basis difficult  the situation is even worse for their productive employees who suffer job losses due to takeovers inspired by this scheme and essential government services which rely on a broad tax base  this could be the big untold story of the current economic decline a decline inspired and manufactured by certain private equity firms  it also explains in large part the constant drumbeat of job outsourcing in that the first thing these private equity firms do is outsource everything off shore possible no matter the long term consequences again congress supposedly foresaw this potential with passage of the “fractions rule” internal revenue code ce in the late ’s to prevent tax exempt entities from trading deductions they cannot use with taxable entities  one need only examine the growth in tandem of public pensions and private equity investment to see the dimension of this issue in the ’s the big issue was depreciation on real estate being given to taxable partners by tax exempt partners in exchange for other benefits   if this were allowed to proliferate there would be no corporate income tax as private equity partnerships manage companies from a tax exempt status and drive tax paying competitors out of the market with lower prices one can forget that taxes are indeed one of the most significant business expenses and eliminating this expense would provide a significant competitive advantage for these private equity firms private equity funds have grown dramatically since then most notably blackstone kkr and tpg  these firms now receive most of their funding from tax exempt public pensions foundations and endowments at times more than  percent for particular partnerships  at the same time they are aggressively investing in businesses which derive most of their revenue from government programs  a good example is blackstone’s recent purchase of oregon’s largest assisted living center sunwest an entity whose primary source of sales are government medicare and medicaid payments somehow the public has been fooled into thinking private equity is something other than a euphemism for leveraged buyout  and while tax exempt investors mostly public pensions use sophisticated lbo strategies including  these caymen island based “blocker corporations” to avoid paying ubit unrelated business taxable income they appear to have altogether neglected the significance of the “fractions rule” and basic economic substance requirements regarding allocations of financial results congress set up the ubit rules specifically to avoid a situation in which tax exempt entities are partners in private equity partnerships and investing in leveraged buyouts to maintain a level playing field  the idea was to tax these tax exempt entities on profits gained from such leveraged buyouts that is ubit tax as noted the ubit rules regarding leveraged buyouts have  however been circumvented through the use of off shore “blocker corporations” set up as an intermediary so that the tax exempt entities are seen as investing in a corporation rather than a partnership in which activity flows directly to them as a partner for example profits and tax deductions nevertheless the fractions rule math is pretty simple as follows if for example  percent of blackstone’s investment partners are tax exempt then  percent of certain tax deductions are unusable and can not be transfer priced or allocated into a situation whether by using equity compensation carry fees or other expenses in which they are transferred to and used by taxable partners while the nation debates whether to tax private equity and hedge fund partners at ordinary or capital gains rates more interesting is whether or not these partners like schwarzman are in clear violation of existing irs tax rules due to an aggressive tax strategy using stock options and carry fees and other deductions  once these machinations are fully understood the tax benefits could be disallowed if the fractions rule has been violated as an example let’s briefly examine the blackstone group more closely whose president tony james visited portland oregon in july   blackstone is arguably the global leader in private equity investment  they are also a major risk for investment advisers like myself given their ability to takeover good companies and remove them from the marketplace  this makes my job much more difficult not only in selecting good investments yet also in maintaining clients who suffer an unnecessary job loss due to one of these senseless takeovers that are now proliferating blackstone and other private equity firms including kkr and tpg essentially set up partnerships with tax exempt entities like oregon pers llc’s  and often have as little as  percent of their own equity in the deals  “tax efficiency reasons” are often cited for private equity funds’ low equity participation  the partnerships then do buyouts of both public and private companies  the above agenda summary is from a recent presentation by blackstone in oregon as tony james noted in his presentation which led to a  million investment in a blackstone partnership they can now use blackstone stock as currency to attract top executives by swapping out their unvested stock options for blackstone options that may be convenient yet irs rules are very clear in prohibiting the trading of valuable tax deductions between taxable entities and tax exempt entities such as public pensions due to abuses in the ’s specifically the “fractions rule” irc ce  was adopted and it only allows the taxable entities to take their share of economic interest in the partnerships  for example the taxable partners could only take  percent of the equity compensation tax deductions when there are no tax exempt partners what it also does not allow is an aggressive strategy using transfer pricing and allocations to circumvent the rule  such strategies may reduce tax exempt entities exposure to ubit yet the fractions rule must still be met what the irs clearly did not want was tax exempt entities like calpers and oregon pers taking a greater share in profits in lieu of trading unusable tax deductions deductions they were not entitled to  as a tax exempt entity  a related specific purpose of the rule was to provide a disincentive to do leveraged buyouts thereby capturing large interest expense deductions and allowing taxable partners to avoid all tax on their profits   and while congress debates whether or not to levy ordinary income or capital gain tax rates on private equity managers it is conceivable that a tax rate of  percent could still result in no tax being paid by general taxable partners such as blackstone’s schwarzman many creative and aggressive tax strategies have been adopted by large law and accounting firms to try to get around this fractions rule   these firms once referred to as the big  yet now the “final ” all have large divisions focused on hedge funds private equity and transfer pricing related strategies to minimize taxation  in addition to being blackstone’s auditor deloitte is also the auditor of record for oregon’s private equity portfolio the question becomes are the taxable partners at blackstone using capitalized carry fees and aggressive transfer pricing rules to avoid all taxation  my practice includes roughly  pers participants here in oregon and i made a public records request for blackstone kkr and tpg’s k partnership filings yet was told that oregon does not receive them for most partnerships and for those it does maintains no file of them remarkably the oregon attorney general’s office adopted the philosphy that since oregon pers is tax exempt they need not ask for nor review this critical document reported to the irs but rather rely exclusively on documents prepared by blackstone kkr and tpg for information  for this reason the oic does not even maintain files for k’s in general  this is somewhat ironic since the current chair of the council is harry demorest former managing partner of arthur andersen’s portland office  demorest  managed the tax practice at arthur andersen before assuming control over the entire office and clearly if anyone should understand the importance of receiving a k it is demorest  another council member richard solomon is also a practicing cpa the following are samples of the few k’s they maintain at oregon pers  they are for kkr and tpg  and were obtained via public information request  when asked for a simple description regarding the accounting treatment for carry fees which do not appear directly on these k’s as capital transfers  the treasurer’s office refused to provide this information one obvious question is why the k capital accounts are so low in relation to the publicly available investment summary by partnership  many things could explain this yet where is the basic transparency  and why won’t the oregon investment council even disclose the accounting treatment they are using for the significant carry fees being paid to general partners  also of interest is perhaps that kkr’s k is done on a “tax books” basis while tpg uses gaap accounting one could argue that tax exempt investors have nothing to gain from receiving a k yet that is simply ridiculous  the k is a key document that includes information regarding values distributions etc  my guess is that this is prevalent among public pensions and would it not be interesting to compare the k’s provided to taxable partners to those provided to tax exempt partners these private equity firms are famous for providing a wide range of “figures” on key reports and related valuations   the financial times see summary visual has reported that blackstone valued one  investment at  percent higher than tpg when even though this investment is in the latter company for an equal amount   these valuations are critical because they drive transfer pricing related deductions and allocations etc goldman sachs even has its own internal specialized exchange which values private equity interests and is where many such private equity interests are bought and sold  it is called the gstrue system and is only accessible on approved bloomberg terminals  remarkably not even the institutional trading areas at td ameritrade or charles schwab have access  perhaps this “dark exchange” needs a little daylight cast especially since the biggest investors in such partnerships are taxpayers via the various public pension systems let’s face it taxes can be boring yet this discussion is important to all investors given that the current level of “buyouts” is removing many quality investments from the market that are later loaded up with debt so that the private equity firms can more quickly earn their “carry fees” which are generally  percent of all profits after returning the original investment to partners   what also results is a job destruction machine that undermines the economy and stability of the financial markets not to mention the tax base  most importantly this undermines investor confidence with the perception that investing has become an insiders’ game of manipulation here is a summary of a few potential “discussion issues” to consider affecting just one private equity firm blackstone   the ceo of blackstone tony james noted in a public meeting in oregon that blackstone options are being used in exchange for unvested options for various purposes including attracting key management talent   he also noted that blackstone uses numerous internal “nonprofit” cost centers to serve its various portfolio companies in the subsidiary partnerships many of which have tax exempt investors   the question becomes how this impacts transfer pricing and the allocation of valuable tax deductions one related question is the following by manipulating the cost of products and services provided to portfolio companies are they essentially creating compensation related carrystock option tax deductions at the blackstone level to be allocated to taxable partners when they belong to tax exempt investors and should be unusable   blackstone’s k for the period ending  does not disclose what would be material adjustments for disallowed equity compensation deductions belonging to tax exempt investors  these pertain to equity compensation in which the executives provide services to portfolio companies  at the july  oregon pers  public meeting james used the example of hiring gerry murphy of kingfisher one of the uk’s largest firms by swapping his unvested options for blackstone options  james also highlighted the service murphy provides to specific portfolio companies in the partnerships if blackstone is creatively allocating expenses to its various partnerships why hasn’t it disclosed the portion of this equity compensation and other related deductions which should be disallowed because they belong to tax exempt partners via an allocation of related expense blocker corporations may solve their ubit tax issues yet the fractions rule must also be independently satisfied many other related questions arise when exchanging options for firms acquired  these deductions need to stay at the acquired firms yet their value would have been created by the transfer of the blackstone options even if the blackstone group lp company is not taking a deduction where is the disclosure in blackstone’s k regarding the disallowed carry executive compensation expense  the firm recognized almost  billion of such carry related compensation expense reducing its income by more than  billion in    the blackstone  k displays the line item stating “noncash equity compensation” of  billion  this resulted in a net loss as shown of approximately  billion in  if this entire amount of equity based compensation listed above pertains to a tax deduction as it usually does with respect to such a line item on a “cash flow statement” this would imply that blackstone pays no federal income tax for activity in  granted they may indeed pay tax related to other areas for example property tax timing differences from prior year  the key question becomes how much of this equity compensation amount pertains to services provided to portfolio companies and what part should be disallowed given that the portfolio company is now partly owned by a tax exempt entity   also is this a material omission by blackstone’s auditor deloitte   the chair of the section on taxation for the american bar association wrote the following letter directly to the irs commissioner doug shulman on january   concerning partnership allocations permitted under section ce    what he is specifically asking for is a revenue ruling to permit more aggressive strategies with respect to the allocation rules regarding partnerships with tax exempt entities ie violating the spirit of the fractions rule  the entire letter with extensive comments can be accessed online with a google search following the letter in this blog post is a list of clients for the lawyer whose firm king   spalding was a key contributor in authoring the letter the key attorneys noted as contacts involved with drafting this letter to irs commissioner doug shulman on behalf of the american bar association are the following in a testament to their legal prowess the first attorney noted works for king  spalding a firm that lists three of the four largest cpa firms price waterhouse coopers ernst  young and kpmg as  clients along with goldman sachs citigroup bank of america and wells fargo at the same time the aba is seeking a revenue ruling waiver from the irs the private equity and hedge fund industries are pursuing a simultaneous track in congress  this was introduced in the th congress and reintroduced as hr in the th congress  both bills are sponsored by sanford levin of michigan not to be confused with younger brother carl levin in the us senate   hr  has only three cosponsors and has been referred to the appropriations committee where sanford levin is chairman perhaps most interesting is that at the same time us representative sanford levin is introducing a bill that could dilute the fractions rule he is also introducing another bill hr  to tax private equity partners at ordinary income rates  the irony is that his one bill hr  could indeed result in no tax regardless of the rate meanwhile his younger brother carl levin is cosponsoring a bill with jeff merkley of oregon designed to help states avoid teacher layoffs  carl levin has also been a leader in the effort to reform stock option accounting  it is unfortunate that a key driver in the funding gap in state governments is increased public employee retirement system contributions due to significant investment losses and concern over the lack of liquidity with respect to their private equity portfolios i have some simple advice for the current administration  aggressively enforce the fractions rule and prohibit tax exempt organizations from using blocker corporations or any other vehicle that ultimately results in a leveraged buyout within three years of a firms’ acquisition by a partnership in which they participate  if we simply eliminate the fuel for these senseless takeovers that is tax exempt pension and endowment money we’ll go a long way toward protecting good companies along with their employees and current investors for those of you wanting to enjoy a little sunshine and rub shoulders with wayne pressgrove and other key voices from the american bar association in this debate including leaders at the internal revenue service consider attending the upcoming conference in january at the boca raton resort  details are provided below  perhaps it is somewhat ironic that indeed the blackstone group now owns the boca raton resort via one of its real estate partnerships perhaps also ironic is that blackstone’s novel approach of issuing a publicly traded security on the new york stock exchange one that is not a stock but rather a partnership allowing tax benefits to flow directly to general partners may afterall allow many of those same benefits if indeed such deductions lack economic substance to flow right back to the treasury   for taxpayers both individuals looking at higher rates and corporate alike including the likes of warren buffett who has roundly criticizes this structure  this could amount to “sweet justice” perhaps my alma matter the university of oregon may indeed set a good precedent by defeating the auburn tigers pressgrove’s alma matter the week prior in the bcs championship series  spending several hours
