in the last four years by george j coates a new jersey inventor like the beverage can that cant and the speedy horseshoe that wasnt  both features of earlier unrelated schemes that cost public investors dearly  the coates engine is now described by securities regulators as a device chiefly useful for generating cash for its inventor lawyers from the new york regional office of the securities and exchange commission went to court yesterday morning against mr coates  of wall nj in a civil case filed in federal district court in manhattan the sec accused mr coates of lying about the merits of his invention and using those falsehoods to illegally sell  million in stock to nearly  people across the country hours later mr coates was arrested at his new jersey office by united states postal service inspectors acting on a criminal complaint signed by the united states attorneys office in manhattan the complaint charged mr coates with one count of mail fraud in connection with his solicitation of investors many of these investors were neither wealthy nor sophisticated and were induced to invest their savings on the basis of mr coatess claims herbert j cohen an sec lawyer said in an affidavit filed in the civil case the sec charged that mr coates had used much of the money he raised for his own personal expenses including the purchase of  million worth of real estate talk of fleeing country the lawyer for mr coates william j wolf of lakewood nj did not respond to messages left at his office yesterday mr coates remained in custody in new jersey yesterday evening and could not be reached for comment under federal procedure he was to be arraigned before a magistrate who would consider a bail request prosecutors then must obtain a grand jury indictment within a specified period of time or negotiate an extension with the defendant in announcing the arrest united states attorney mary jo white noted that mr coates had told investors former business associates and even staff lawyers at the sec that he intended to flee the country if confronted by the authorities if convicted on the mailfraud charge he would face a possible fiveyear prison term and a fine of up to twice the gross loss incurred by investors according to the lawsuit mr coates falsely contended that his engine produced less pollution and ran more efficiently than conventional engines he contended that its performance had been verified by independent testing laboratories not true the lawsuit said in fact the lawsuit charged that the only emissions tests done on the engine in  and  showed that it generated so much pollution that it could not hope to meet federal or state emissions standards nevertheless many people were fooled by the inventors claims the sec said forged and unreliable tests mr coates distributed forged and unreliable tests to potential investors the commission said and one test was an unofficial tuneup test conducted at a local service station he also said he had received hundreds of thousands of orders the commission charged when he actually had a single order for two prototypes which actually cracked or failed during preliminary testing magazines and newspapers  including the new york times  featured his engine in articles published in  mr coates then distributed some of those articles to potential investors along with newsletter articles and letters he prepared according to court documents as early as april  the commission charged mr coates started selling stock to individual investors without registering it with the commission as required by federal law between april  and the present according to the commission his companies raised  million through stock sales and he personally raised an additional  million by selling shares that the sec said might have been counterfeit those unregistered stock sales have continued ever since said richard walker regional sec director  which is why the commission asked judge kimba m wood of federal district court in manhattan yesterday to freeze mr coatess assets and appoint a receiver to take control of his business order to freeze assets judge wood signed an order at midday freezing the assets and appointing a receiver to oversee the companys affairs the sec has asked judge wood to approve both a preliminary and a permanent injunction barring mr coates from any future violatons of securities laws in most sec cases such requests are the legal equivalent of locking the barn after the horse is gone but in this case the agency argued in court yesterday the requested injunctions against future violations have a very compelling goal to stop mr coates from continuing to sell his stock to the public according to sec documents filed with judge wood before mr coates was arrested mr coates continued to buy and sell his companys stock in violation of securities laws even while the commission was investigating him as recently as july   coates admitted that he buys stock personally from investors and sells it to other investors a commission lawyer noted in an affidavit coates admits that he makes a profit on each of these transactions and that despite advice from an attorney to stop selling stock he will keep doing it forever  photo george j coates the inventor of a rotary valve engine was arrested yesterday by postal service inspectors on a charge

dreaming about using the massive energy from the sun to supply the power we consume on earth – well that is exactly what coates international ltd and secure supplies llc are now working on together – the production of gaseous hydrogen from the sun’s rays and fueling coates csrv industrial electric power generators with this hydorgen to generate seamless continous electricity – this is believed to be the most “green energy” project of its kind in the world shareholders’ update wall township nj – globe newswire – april   for immediate release coates international ltd otc pink cote the “company” is pleased to announce that our projects are moving forward  the first industrial v qst g engine for the hydrogen technology was delivered to the coates plant in new jersey  pictures can be viewed on the company website  wwwcoatesenginecom company president and ceo mr george j coates comments  “scientists around the world have been dreaming about tapping into the sun’s energy to produce electric power on earth  that is exactly what we are working on now  harvesting hydrogen from the sun that can be used to fuel coates csrv industrial electric power generators  we believe this will achieve the highest form of environmental “green energy” technology of its kind  the coates csrv engines are most suitable to operate on gaseous hydrogen because there are no hot spots in the combustion chamber and valve overlap is not required because the volumetric efficiency is more than enough to charge the cylinders  conventional poppet valve engines will not work because the exhaust valve gets red hot and causes hydrogen to detonate socalled pre ignition  poppet valves require larger overlap which means exhaust and inlet valves are open at the same time  this also causes hydrogen to detonate and backfire gaseous hydrogen is normally highly volatile and may detonate easily without proper safeguards  here at coates headquarters we have developed proprietary technology over the past year to integrate the proper safeguards with our csrv technology enabling the gaseous hydrogen to be used safely as the main fuel source   patent protection will be applied for in the near future the coates csrv engines were designed to operate on almost any engine fuel type and are particularly well suited to operate on gaseous hydrogen we have received inquiries regarding large volumes of shares being trading on the open market  other than shares issued upon conversion of promissory notes issued six months ago or more it is not possible to determine any specific reasons for our daily trading volume because it is not within our control  update on activities planned in china  chinese officials have visited coates’ headquarters and senior company directors visited china and executed an exclusive license with renown power  the company has already received a  deposit and delivered one  kw n electric generator to coates power in china and received a  payment  during the visit by a chinese delegation last year top executives expressed that they would put a proposal together for the coates company  mr james pang the company’s exclusive liaison agent to china to work on this with the chinese government  the company is in negotiations for possible solar hydrogen projects in china and certain other countries in the uae and far east hydrogenbased ultra “green energy” projects will be beneficial to the environment contribute to the reduction of global warming and reduce the volume of co hc and co particles being introduced into our atmosphere among other benefits  this is consistent with the company’s mission statement to benefit both the shareholders and humankind” there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in any of its endeavors safe harbor

hydrogen which is stored in special expansion tanks  when the sun goes down the coates csrv electric power generators fire up operating on the stored hydrogen which is produced by the sun  these csrv generators are synchronous and only produce the power required at any given time up to  mw  these are the most “green” projects ever  these projects are many worldwide  coates csrv engines are the

different projects  we expect to have our csrv green engine technology retrofit to a cummins industrial engine generator set completed in the next two weeks  progress photos are being posted on the

are only able to operate in emergency backup operation  natural gas is not a good combustion engine fuel as it does not contain any lubricity it is absolutely dry and poppet valve engines burn out with continuous operation  on the other hand the coates csrv green engine technology system will operate continuously with no adverse effects because of the csrv rotation action selfcleaning and lower temperature operation reduces wear and tear and also reduces fuel consumption and lowers the production of harmful emissions the cummins engine operating temperature averages ° f  the coates csrv operating temperature is ° f  this makes a big difference in the longevity of the power unit and a major reduction in harmful emissions produced such as co hc and nox there can be no assurance that

prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reflects less than  million of total assets coates owns many valuable assets that are not permitted to be reflected on its balance sheet by the gaap rules when an investor is considering acquiring another company there are many factors that go into a decision making process that cannot be found in the gaapbasis financial statements this includes the fair market value of intangible assets quality of the customer lists value of vendor relationships contingent liabilities potential income tax exposure and unrecorded assets and liabilities explanatory comments from barry c kaye cfo “while gaap is required to be followed by every publicly traded company management believes that no single rule can anticipate every circumstance and therefore the resulting presentation of a company’s financial condition may not be very meaningful in some cases proof of this can be found in the hundreds of revisions to gaap some of which have been drastic changes promulgated by the governing bodies that establish gaap dating back to the ’s in essence gaap is an art form that is continuously evolving in an attempt to improve the quality of audited financial statements however attempts to keep refining gaap will likely continue indefinitely and many of the socalled improvements did not achieve the desired outcome and had to be amended andor superseded my early exposure to gaap occurred in the early ’s and it is hard to believe how aspects had to be unlearned because of the unimaginable pervasive revisions over the last  years”the following stockholders’ update has been primarily prepared to provide a more meaningful picture of the company’s financial condition results of operations and prospects  things to consider about the company’s financial condition and results of operationsa  intellectual property the company’s most significant asset which consists of exclusive rights to patents for manufacturing sales and distribution leasing and sublicensing of the coates csrv technology throughout the western hemisphere is not permitted by gaap to be presented on its balance sheet the company has already received firm orders amounting to future sales of  million of csrv gen sets which is indisputable evidence that these patent rights have current value and substantial future value the value of intangible assets is determined based on the reasonably expected future stream of cash flows that can only be generated by the owner of the intangible assetb  the company owns numerous prototypes of products that demonstrate the benefits of csrv technology including industrial generators synchronous home generators vehicles and automobile engines these were all developed over the course of many years through research and development in accordance with gaap all expenses incurred during research and development are required to be charge to expense as incurred rather than showing the cost of the prototypes as assets on the balance sheet none of these prototypes are included in the company’s assets on its balance sheet almost  million has been expensed during the production of the prototypes including approximately  million invested by the coates family prior to inception of the company according to george j coates these prototypes are used regularly to demonstrate the viability and benefits of the csrv technology these are unique assets that cannot be acquired or reproduced without incurring extensive costs over a long timeframec  the company’s results of operations also include certain expenses that are required to be recorded by gaap which will never require any outlay of cash this includes over  million for stockbased compensation since

stretches out certain orders can become stale  for this reason we continue to press on to achieve our goal of manufacturing products in larger quantities  the company has engaged many parts and components manufacturers in the usa to supply these items  these custom parts require a lot of time to be produced to our specifications our costs of procurement will be higher than we would expect to incur until we can place our orders in economic quantities  we expect that we will be able to reduce these costs and generate acceptable gross margins  we will be required to sell our products at competitive prices even though our csrv systems are the most advanced in the world  our competitor’s gen sets are only suitable as standby emergency units and have a relatively short life span when

wwwcoatesenginecomwwwmostadvancedenginecomthursday  july  coates international ltd has been contacted by certain people entities and institutions to explain how the company can claim that the coates csrv patented internal combustion engine is the most advanced in the worldwall township nj – marketwired – july   coates international ltd otc pink cote the “company” directors asked company president and ceo mr george j coates to respondcommentsthe poppet valve engine has been around for more than  years and the poppet valves camshafts cam followers rockers tappets and push rods are the biggest problems in the design of the poppet valve internal combustion engine  manufacturers have tried everything to make the poppet valve engine more efficient adding more poppet valves overhead camshafts turbo chargers and super chargers  all of these attempts have made very little improvements that will never meet with new regulations epa and carbon reduction world standards it will be quite impossible to create a poppet valve engine that will meet the new required standards of internal combustion engine thermal efficiencieson the other hand here at coates international ltd we have designed the most advanced csrv internal combustion engine in the world  we claim this because of the following  in a n or  cummins industrial engine we eliminate  parts and components out of that engine  eliminate the oil pressure supply to the head of the engine and only utilize the engine oil pressure for the cranks shaft bearing supply to the lower half of the cylinders  we replace all  parts with only two assembly csrv rotating shafts and two floating seals for each cylinder  greater volumetric efficiency up to double that of the poppet valve has been achieved  utilizing higher compression ratios of  to  and up to  to   poppet valve engines in vehicles using gasoline are approximately  to  caterpillar cummins  to  operating on natural gas and only operate as stand by emergency systems and not constant operating service  the coates csrv engines have been independently tested and have proven results with more hp higher rpms lower fuel consumption higher thermal efficiencies while producing lower harmful emissions released into our atmosphere  the coates csrv engines operate on natural gas cng lng propane hydrogen gasoline diesel and a combination of these fuels  poppet valves cannot operate higher than  to  compression ratio operating on lng cng because the poppet valves are constantly in the combustion chamber and get red hot when the constant temperature of the combustion chamber exceeds ° f when it does it manufactures no x oxides of nitrogen and co carbon monoxide and uses much more fuel the engine thermal efficiency is reduced  the governments around the world are asking the impossible of the poppet engine  the coates csrv spherical rotary valve system constantly rotates away from the combustion chamber heat using incoming air to cool the inlet and cooling the exhaust with a water cooling system through the center of the exhaust assembly shaft  gallons of water per minute  there is no servicing or adjusting or maintenance to the csrv system for the life of the engine  engine oil changes are extended to  miles or more  the reason poppet valve engines do not last operating on natural gas this fuel does not have any lubricating properties contained in it  as a result number  piston rings in poppet valve engines wear out in a very short time  the coates csrv engines incorporate the patented coates sequential fuel injection system that injects a minute amount of diesel fuel in with the natural gas that the engine operates on  this prevents excessive wear on number one piston rings  incorporating higher compression ratios  incorporating greater volumetric efficiencies  less moving parts  utilizing a stoic metric mixture throughout the acceleration curve creates the highest thermal efficient internal combustion engineall this technology was invented and designed by mr george j coates and his son gregory g coates over more than  years  many patents have been awarded from the usa and from most industrial countries around the worldall of the above technology and design is the reason that we call this csrv engine the most advanced internal combustion engine in the world  there is nothing out

could operate on  no engine manufacturer builds engines to operate continuously on flare off gas  coates international ltd is the only company in the world that manufactures engines and generators that operate on flare gas or waste gas continuously including cng – lng propane hydrogen gasoline and dieselwall township nj – marketwired – april   coates international ltd otcbbcote the “company”  there are no lubricating elements contained in natural gas  poppet valve engines that are put on this fuel only last for a short period and then the engines are totally destroyed  coates international ltd designs and builds csrv engines and gen sets specifically to operate successfully on flare off gas landfill gas cng – lng and other engine fuels as referenced in the associated press via yahoo finance april    bismarck nd ap – five oil companies must reduce their production at certain wells in north dakota as a penalty for burning off more natural gas than allowed last month a spokeswoman for the state’s oil and gas division saidthe state ordered the five companies to curb their production to  barrels per day at certain wells starting this month  alison ritter a spokeswoman for the division said this is the largest number of companies and wells the state has sanctioned since new flaring regulations took effect on jan  the bismark tribune reportedthe new rules require companies to capture at least  percent of natural gas produced during oil production  under a policy adopted by the state industrial commission the barrel restriction applies to companies that are not capturing at least  percent of the gas from the wellthe division ordered production to be restricted at certain wells operated by emerald oil occidental petroleum corporation qep abraxas petroleum and enerpluscoates international ltd president and ceo mr george j coates comments  “natural gas flare off gas and cnglng do not have any lubricating elements contained in this fuel  poppet valve engines that are converted to operate on natural gas simply do not last very long without sustaining permanent and serious damage  poppet valves develop pitting and piston compression rings wear out in a very short time  scuffing and corrosion is also a problem as this gas is sometimes acidic“coates international ltd has designed and developed the patented coates spherical rotary valve csrv engine that operates on these gases successfully and continuously  there are no poppet valves in the combustion chamber of the coates engines  the csrv system is made of noncorrosive alloys  no engine oil is used to lubricate the csrv system  a patented sequential injection system is incorporated that injects a minute amount of diesel onto the walls of the cylinders to lubricate the number one compression piston rings of each cylinder  natural gas only contains  btus  the csrv system utilizes much higher compression ratios  there is no maintenance required to the csrv system for the life of the engine  engine oil changing intervals are extended from  to  miles or more  servicing downtime is reduced  emissions are reduced dramatically  fuel consumption is reduced by  or more  much greater volumetric efficiency  less vibration smoother and quiet running  higher engine thermal efficiency“diesel fuel contains a little over  btus gasoline contains a little over  btus and natural gas contains only  btus“engine manufacturers do not produce engines that operate on flare off gas they gave up trying  standard poppet valve engines operate on natural gas and incorporate an  to  compression ratio  the csrv incorporates a  to  ratio  this makes a tremendous difference in higher thermal efficiency reducing fuel consumption and lowering emissions“the coates organization has a great future once it starts producing these csrv products in large numbers and fills its customers’ orders”there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in any of its endeavorssafe harbor statementthis

csrv® engines operate on a wide range of alternative fuels such as natural gas cng lng propane and hydrogen as well as all standard engine fuels the thermal efficiency of the csrv® engines is due to the design which incorporates much higher compression ratios than the poppet valve greater volumetric efficiency of the csrv® system less load required to operate the valve system and the elimination of engine oil in the csrv® system are the key enablers in the company’s clean burning and “green” engine products after the company receives definitive documentation management will visit china to

water into a type of hydroxy gas that can be used as fuel for combustion engines and other types of engines including heating for homes are possible and other uses   we have found a way of loosening the covalent bond of water molecules that makes it much easier to reconstruct water molecules into a type of hydroxy gas after it is used it turns back into water we utilize all of the water molecules not part of them there are no byproducts leftover  the energy used to loosen the covalent bond does not require extra energy used it’s already there water ho rd  °c mp °c bp °c in the gas phase water consists of single molecules in which the hoh  angle is ° the structure of liquid water is still controversial hydrogen bonding of ho…hoh imposes a high degree of structure current experimental studies supported by xray scattering have shortrange order regions which are constantly disintegrating and reforming this ordering of the liquid state is sufficient to create the density of water approximately °c because of its angular shape water molecules have a permanent dipole moment in addition it has a strong hydrogen covalent bond and has a high dielectric constant pure liquid water is very weakly dissociated into ho and oh ions by self ionization more stable fuel can be produced by adding a type of carbon hog  cs → cog  h g and the reaction can be used for the production of fuelthe secret is to produce more fuel energy than the energy it takes to produce the fuel or hoh gas we will start our phase ii testing now and have the answers to these questions when all tests are

distinguished visitors were in attendance at our open house where the lineup of coates csrv® engines were demonstrated operating on alternative fuels such as natural gas cng lng and propane in addition the coates hydrogen reactor was activated whereupon it successfully generated hydroxy gas on the spot to power a coates csrv engine thereby validating the feasibility of producing engine fuels from the reconstruction of water molecules into hydroxy gasmr coates’s comments this coates hydrogen reactor could be the ultimate “green” technology we convert water molecules into a type of hydroxy gas using all of the water molecules without generating any byproducts and without utilizing any ambient air this is made possible because as the converted hydroxy gas is utilized to power the engine it immediately reverts back into water from the exhaust  we are working on phase ii of this project which should be completed shortly after which testing will commence  we have plans to test this system on industrial generators jet engines and pulse rocket enginesthere can be no assurance made that the company will be successful in any of its endeavorsthis press release contains

coates heavy truck csrv retrofit systemsthe company has already designed and built the coates csrv® retrofit system for certain wheeler heavy duty trucks licenses for this application are available to suitable dealerships and other qualified truck engine servicers the csrv® system could meet president obama’s recently announced objectives for new lower emission standards and reduced fuel consumption furthermore the csrv® system can be adapted to enable the truck engines to operate on alternative fuels and mixtures of fuels phase ii of our hydrogen reactor project is progressing well the second test will take place within approximately two weeks  we have many energy companies interested in this project and a number of new patents will be applied for soon only water andor sea water is needed as the fuel source which is split into a form of hydrogen gas the hydrogen gas  maybe converted into liquid forms by adding other elements to the mix to produce fuel suitable for other applicationsthe chinese transaction is still progressing mr james pang is in china negotiating this terms as our representative  a few things that are slowing down the process include bad weather the chinese new year and the fact that different regions of china speak different chinese dialects complicating translation and communicationscoates international ltd open house meetings had a good two

working capital to commence production here in the usa we welcome their assistancethere are a number of transactions pending here in the usa for our company and we are diligently working on all of themmr george coates our president and ceo comments the coates csrv® retrofit systems for heavy duty trucks could answer president obama’s executive order to lower fuel consumption and reduce harmful emissions from heavy truck engines we believe this is only possible with incorporating the coates csrv® system by retrofitting these trucks there is no other alternative to achieve his objective for new tough standards to reduce fuel consumption and emissions to achieve this you must raise engine compression ratios from  up to  and increase volumetric efficiency by at least  and enable the use of alternative fuel mixtures such as natural gas cnglng liquid hydrogen diesel and combinations of these fuels here at coates international ltd we already have these systems in operation when we retrofit our csrv® systems to these engines we eliminate  moving parts and components from the engine and replace them with only two moving csrv® shafts that do not require engine oil  oil change intervals maybe extended to over  miles  no servicing or maintenance to the coates csrv® retrofit system is requiredthere can be no assurance made that the company will be successful in any of its endeavorsthis

truck pollution and reduce fuel consumption this is not possible with  year old poppet valve truck enginespresident obama took another step to curb green house gas pollution on tuesday last week without waiting for congress as he directed his administration to develop new regulations to reduce carbon emissions from the heavyduty trucks that transport the nation’s goodsappearing in a grocery chain truck in a washington dc suburb the president said that the transportation department and the environmental protection agency would draft new fuel economy standards for heavy trucks by march  they could be completed a year after that as he rushes to put in place a new regulation structure before leaving officemr coates is a research scientist in the design and development of power and propulsion systems of numerous types including gas turbines steam turbines pulse detonation rocket engines internal combustion engines and moremr coates’ comments  it’s quite impossible to reduce fuel consumption and lower harmful emissions of heavyduty trucks by any significant margin as they are designed today with the antique design of the more than  year old poppet valve  for the following reasonspoppet valves are permanently incased in the combustion chamber and are subject to constant heat of that chamber  the instantaneous combustion is approximately °f the constant temperature of the combustion chamber should not exceed °f if it does the engine will manufacture nox nitrousoxides a deadly pollution  to lower the fuel consumption of heavy truck engines and reduce the harmful emissions produced it is necessary to raise the compression ratio and increase the engine volumetric efficiency  this is not possible with poppet valve engines because when you raise the compression ratio you create higher combustion chamber temperatures  poppet valves get red hot and burnout while producing much more harmful pollutants preignition occurs and will waste more fuel  truck engine manufacturers already tried this with adding more poppet valves and incorporating turbo chargers they failed to achieve success in creating a higher thermally efficient enginehere at coates international ltd over many years we have designed and developed industrial coates spherical rotary valve csrv® engines precisely for this purposemost standard heavy duty truck engines incorporate compression ratios of   the coates csrv® industrial retrofit truck engine compression ratios range from  and up to  and volumetric efficiency can be almost twice that of the poppet valve engine  our csrv® engines will operate on a multitude of alternative fuels  when we retrofit these engines we eliminate  parts and components as well as the oil from a standard poppet valve system in heavyduty truck engines if more technical or scientific information is required please contact the company the coates csrv® engines and retrofit systems are fully warranted we plan to grant licenses to suitable

etcoates international ltd phase two of the coates hydrogen reactor project is rapidly moving successfully forwardphase two of the coates hydrogen reactor project is moving forward with great successmr coates explains “there are literally thousands of people and scientists researching the energy contained in water ho all encountering the same obstacles or laws of science energy in less energy out here at coates rd plant we have come up with a new invention that weakens the quantum electromagnetic covalent bond of the atomic structure of molecules in water ho in water molecules the oxygen atom attracts the electrons in an oh covalent bond the hydrogen has no inner shell of electrons to shield the nucleus and there is an electrostatic interaction between the hydrogen proton and the single pair of electrons on the oxygen atom in the associate molecules each oxygen atom has two associates pairs of electrons and can make hydrogen bond to two different hydrogen atoms the strengths of hydrogen bonds are about one tenth of the strengths of normal covalent bonds hydrogen bonding does have significant effects on physical properties it accounts for the unusual properties of water and for the relatively high boiling point of ho hf and nh compared with hs hc and phwe have come up with a new device that weakens the covalent bond in water ho molecules making it much easier to split water into hydrogen in larger quantities in a shorter time period this new apparatus does not include more energy in to produce hydrogen it requires less energy in to split water into hydrogen  no new energy is required to weaken the covalent bong of the water molecules we expect to have the new reactor ready for testing in the next two weeks we already have csrv® engines operating on water split into hydrogen so we know it worksthe chinese new year starts today we believe it will go on for two weeks we are ready to go when they are letters of intent preliminary agreements and

designing and manufacturing the first coates water splitting reactor that produces hydrogel or hydroxyl gas on demand that is used to power a coates csrv  hp internal combustion enginemanagement comments our company is developing innovative solutions addressing environmental problems eliminating the cost of fuel and electric power generation with our hydrogen reactor project water is the only source of fuel used in the reactor the coates reactor splits the water and produces hydroxyl hydrogen that is used as fuel to operate the csrv engine the next phase will be to adapt the coates reactor to a home csrv generator management is anticipating great future potential for this new coates hydrogen reactor productmr coates comments many companies and individuals are experimenting with hydrogen for instance bmw has a car operating on compressed liquid hydrogen the only problem is the liquid hydrogen costs more than gasoline to produce so that puts a stop on that other companies have busses operating on hydrogen sells that work but take up one third of the buses capacity and cost substantial amounts to produce on the other hand the coates hydrogen reactor splits the hydrogen gas from water on demand for instance a  kw csrv home generator would power the hydrogen reactor with a fraction of its output power to produce the hydrogen that the generator operates on this would mean that electric power required for a home generator would be produced from water and the coates reactor design is inexpensive to produceif we can get the next phase on this hydrogen reactor project completed

general elec co  fd   d cir although determining issues of materiality and scienter on summary judgment requires caution this court nonetheless has the authority to determine these issues on motion see fed r civ p  as to the issue of materiality the supreme court has articulated the following standard the determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him and these assessments are peculiarly one for the trier of fact only if the established omissions are so obviously important to an investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriate for summary judgment tsc indus  us at   sct  as to the issue of scienter this court notes that determining a persons subjective state of mind is peculiarly inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment here however as discussed below various representations were clearly material and knowingly false and various omissions were obviously material and were known to coates this court notes that the commissions motion for summary judgment was supported by extensive documentation of coates fraud violation the documentation included a transcript of coates testimony taken during the commissions investigation and documents drafted by the defendant himself including the registration statement coates submitted to the commission in response to the commissions welldocumented motion coates revised local rule  statement of material facts admits the truth of the majority of material facts set forth in the commissions local rule  statement of material facts after considering the parties voluminous submissions this court finds that coates has violated the antifraud provisions of the exchange act by knowingly making misrepresentations and omissions of material facts in connection with the sale of cil securities coates violated the exchange act with respect to his statements regarding  the epa emissions testing  cils interactions with harleydavidson  the orders for the coates system and  the reassignment of the patents from cil to coates this court also finds that coates statements regarding chrysler did not violate the exchange act  misrepresentations and omissions regarding epa emissions standards coates statements concerning the epa emissions testing violated the exchange acts antifraud provisions in the confidential information memorandum which was disseminated to potential investors regarding a private offering of cil stock coates stated that the coates system engine under an internally supervised test far surpassed the emissions standards imposed by the epa in addition to this the memorandum included a chart listing comparisons between the federal emissions standards and the coates system engine emissions the internally supervised test was not performed at an epaapproved laboratory and was not performed with a dynamometer thus the statements in the memorandum and the comparisons in the chart give a false impression that the coates system engines emissions levels would satisfy epa requirements coates states that the statement in the memorandum is accurate because the tests referred to were conducted internally however coates does not address cils inability to determine through its inhouse tests whether its engines could comply with epa or federal requirements without the use of a dynamometer a recklessly inaccurate and incomplete placement memorandum cannot be used to gull and lull an investor spatz v borenstein  fsupp   ndill furthermore coates represented in the march   and march   stockholder letters that the coates system engines were either being testing by the epa or were undergoing some sort of epa testing coates also referred to an independent emissions test which indicated that the coates system engines had the lowest emissions in the world on the whole the letters indicate that the independent emissions test is related to official epa testing or epa testing requirements in fact the epa never conducted any testing of the coates engines and the only epa testing facility that did conduct tests on the coates system engines found emissions levels higher than those required by the epa coates states that epa emissions standards are irrelevant because coates was designing racing engines which do not require epa approval although it is true that one of cils targeted industries was the racing industry the december  offering memoranda and the second amended registration statement do not limit the applications of coates system engines to racing in addition coates himself made the epa standards relevant by promoting their importance in his correspondence with stockholders and potential stockholders this court therefore finds that coates statements in the december  memorandum and in the two march  stockholder letters were material misrepresentations see eg hoffman v estabrook  co inc  fd   st cir representation that company had working prototype of computer system violated the antifraud provisions where company at most had developed laboratory and engineering prototypes furthermore coates knew at the time that he made the statements in the december  memorandum and the march  stockholder letters that the epa was not involved in any testing of the coates system and that the independent testing to which he referred was not conducted by an epaapproved facility coates also omitted information in the december  memorandum and in the march  stockholder letters concerning the results of the compliance tests which revealed emission levels that were substantially higher than the epa maximums coates states that the compliance test results are immaterial because  the purpose of the testing was not to access emissions levels  the vehicle tested was not equipped with an air pump egr valve or catalytic converter which are pollution reduction devices and  following the compliance tests but prior to the december  memorandum coates made improvements to the coates system see defs r  stmt ¶¶ c a see also pls ex  coates tr at  given the lapse of time between the compliance tests and the december  offering the possible improvements made to the coates system between those times and the lack of pollution reduction features on the vehicle tested this court cannot determine whether a reasonable investor would have found the compliance test results so obviously important as to make their omission material see tsc indus  us at   sct   misrepresentations and omissions regarding harleydavidson coates omissions regarding harleys test results do not violate the exchange act however coates misrepresentations with regard to harleys testing of the coates system do violate the exchange acts antifraud provisions in november  harley notified coates that it was discontinuing testing of the coates prototype engines because of mechanical durability problems however coates did not include this information or the adverse results of the evaluations performed by harley in the december  offering memoranda coates contests the materiality of the harley test results stating that the malfunctions were caused by the harley engineers disregard of coates test protocol see defs r  stmt ¶ c coates also states that the only parts of the engine that were damaged were harley parts rather than coates parts see id ¶ e the issues raised by coates concerning the november   harley test results prevent this court from deciding whether a reasonable investor would find the omission of this information important given the total mix of information see tsc indus  us at   sct  therefore this court cannot determine on this motion whether the omission is material however in addition to omitting information regarding the harley test results coates represented in the july   stockholder letter that harley was conducting final testing on the coates system engines it is not contested that in fact harley was not conducting final testing on any coates engines coates misrepresentations concerning harleys testing of the coates system in the july   stockholder letter are material see eg alna capital assocs v wagner  fsupp   sdfla finding inaccurate report concerning nature of distributorship agreement for major product material coates acted with the requisite scienter since he knew before july   that harley had discontinued testing and was not engaged in any final testing of the coates prototype engines  misrepresentations and omissions regarding orders coates violated the antifraud provisions of the exchange act due to his misrepresentations and omissions regarding orders for coates system engines the march   march   july   and october   stockholder letters coates mailed to investors or potential investors indicated that cil had a substantial number of firm orders for engines equipped with the coates system the commission has demonstrated that cil did not possess firm orders for coates system engines at the time these letters were mailed the commission also points to coates investigation testimony and the registration statement he submitted to the commission to show that coates knew his representations concerning the orders were misleading coates misrepresentations concerning firm orders and his omissions concerning cils inability to manufacture or sell engines commercially are material since there is a substantial likelihood that such information would be perceived as important by a reasonable investor see eg sec v research automation corp  fd    n  d cir see also san leandro emerg med group profit sharing plan v philip morris cos

affect the desire of investors to buy sell or hold the companys securities quoting sec v texas gulf sulphur co  fd   d cir coates has failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the orders he submits that cil did possess thousands of engine orders see defs r  stmt ¶ h however his attached exhibit of these orders shows that the orders are either provisional orders or inquiries establishing interest in ordering coates exhibit does not demonstrate any firm orders see defs ex  coates also submits that although cil could not manufacture engines at the time his statements were made cil was capable of entering into licensing agreements see defs r  stmt ¶¶  however coates cannot establish that any licensing agreement was successfully finalized during the time his statements were made  mispresentations and omissions regarding the patents coates also violated the exchange act with respect to his representations regarding the ownership of the five patents for the coates system by assigning his rights in the coates system patents to cil one day before the december  offering and failing to disclose that cil authorized the transfer of the patents back to him in january  coates fraudulently misrepresented his rights to the coates system these misrepresentations and omissions are material and relevant to the sale of stock because the ownership of the engine patents was one of cils principal assets furthermore coates clearly acted with the requisite scienter since he knew the patents were transferred to him by cil in january  and did not update the information contained in the december  memorandum cf iit v cornfeld  fd   d cir accounting firms do have a duty to take reasonable steps to correct misstatements they have discovered in previous

regarding chrysler coates statements and omissions concerning his dealings with chrysler did not violate the exchange act coates received the results of the chrysler test dated june   which found no proof that the system functioned as claimed the results of the chrysler tests were not included in the august   stockholder letter and furthermore this letter misrepresents chryslers level of interest in the coates system the court need not decide whether the omission and misrepresentation concerning chrysler contained in the august   letter are material the omission and misrepresentation do not fall within the ambit of section b or rule b because they were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities see superintendent of insur of new york v bankers life  casualty co  us   sct   ledd   indicating that where a deception touches a purchase or sale of securities the in connection with requirement of section b is met in fact the letter was only sent to stockholders of cil

point in time they would have had to acquire the stock however their ownership of the stock does not make them purchasers  since their purchases occurred prior to the alleged fraud of which they complain c civil penalty against coates as discussed above this court finds that coates has violated federal securities laws due to  his misrepresentations concerning epa emissions standards in the december  memorandum the march   stockholder letter and the march   stockholder letter  his misrepresentations concerning harleys testing of the coates prototype engines in the july   stockholder letter  his misrepresentations and omissions concerning orders for coates system engines in the march   march   july   and october   stockholder letters and  his failure to correct the statement contained in the december  memorandum with regard to ownership of the coates system patents due to coates violations of the exchange act the commission asks this court to impose civil penalties against coates pursuant to the securities enforcement remedies and penny stock reform act of   usc § ud the remedies act the commission suggests that each of coates violations should fall under the third tier of civil penalties available under the remedies act and that the total amount imposed should be  see  usc § udbiii allowing  penalty against a natural person if violation involved fraud and created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons the remedies act was enacted to achieve the dual goals of punishment of the individual violator and deterrence of future violations sec v moran  fsupp   sdny the house report on the remedies act states the committee believes that the money penalties proposed in this legislation are needed to provide financial disincentives to securities law violations other than insider trading absent a criminal prosecution or a private suit for damages  even the defendant who makes a deliberate decision to violate the law and causes significant harm to the markets does not risk any monetary sanction more severe than an order of disgorgement disgorgement merely requires the return of wrongfully obtained profits it does not result in any actual economic penalty or act as a financial disincentive to engage in securities fraud a violator who avoids detection is able to keep the profits resulting from illicit activities currently even a violator who is caught is required merely to give back his gains with interest leaving him no worse off financially than if he had not violated the law the committee therefore concluded that authority to seek or impose substantial money penalties in addition to the disgorgement of profits is necessary for the deterrence of securities law violations that otherwise may provide great financial returns to the violator hrrep no  st cong d sess reprinted in  usccan   the exchange act provides that any civil penalty is to be determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case see  usc § ud paragraph xi of the coates judgment specifically reserved the issue of whether civil penalties would be imposed against coates in light of all facts and circumstances the coates judgment set forth the following factors for the court to consider in determining whether to impose civil penalties  the egregiousness of the defendants conduct  the degree of the defendants scienter  whether the defendants conduct created substantial losses or the risk of substantial losses to other persons  whether the defendants conduct was isolated or recurrent  the success of the rescission offer as measured by whether those shareholders who request a return of their investment receive a refund equal to the full amount of the money invested  the report of the special master to be prepared following the completion of the rescission offer and  compliance by the defendant with the terms of this final judgment the court may also consider whether the amount of any such penalty that would otherwise be appropriate should be reduced due to the defendants demonstrated current and future financial condition defs ex  coates judgment ¶ xi coates argues that penalties should not be imposed against him because  he has complied with the terms and provisions of the coates judgment including successfully completing the rescission offer and  he believed that entering into the consent agreement with the commission prevented the commission from seeking such civil penalties in opposition the commission argues that the greatest weight in determining the level and amount of penalties should be given to  the egregiousness of coates violations  the degree of coates scienter  the risk of loss to investors and  coates lack of remorse and misconduct during the litigation after reviewing all of the evidence this court finds that civil penalties are warranted in this matter coates argument that he would not have entered into the coates judgment had he known that the commission would later seek civil penalties against him is belied by the very terms of the consent judgment coates agreed to the terms of the coates judgment which included an express reservation of jurisdiction to this court to consider the appropriateness of a civil penalty therefore this court rejects coates argument that a civil penalty should not be imposed in a dispute that is settled see eg sec v custable  wl  ndill imposing a civil penalty for securities act violations despite fact that defendants had voluntarily entered into consent agreements with the sec as to the seriousness of the violations and coates degree of scienter coates antifraud violations went to the heart of the investment he was soliciting the coates system was both the centerpiece of coates promotional campaign and the sole potential source of future revenue for cil thus misrepresentations and omissions concerning the durability and marketability of the coates system created a greater amount of risk to investors than they were aware of because they lacked the information necessary to access the pros and cons of their investment in addition to his violations of the exchange act this court must also consider coates misconduct while this case was under the supervision of judge wood coates twice violated the terms of the asset freezes in place against him did not comply with the provisions governing the rescission offer and created repeated delays in carrying out the terms of the coates judgment thereby requiring continuing intervention by the court coates has also failed to take responsibility for his own actions and has instead placed blame for the difficulties this litigation has caused cil on the commission coates claims that the commission brought this litigation in bad faith and seeks the ruin of cil coates has also stated that the commission has a personal vendetta against coates defs r  stmt ¶ r in sec v moran the court cited the defendants penchant for blaming others including the sec for his own conduct and downplaying of the violations for which he is liable as additional factors warranting the imposition of a civil penalty see sec v moran  fsupp at  against the above factors must be weighed the success of the rescission offer the small number of investors who elected to take part in the rescission offer the degree of support evinced by the nonrescinding shareholders coates cooperation with the special master and the arrest and incarceration of coates although coates did not conduct the rescission offer in the manner specified by the court the rescission offer was ultimately successfully completed only  investors with a total investment of  million chose to participate in the rescission offer and of those  investors two shareholders had invested  of the  million those shareholders who did not elect rescission have repeatedly petitioned this court in favor of coates voicing their belief in his commitment to cil and to the best interests of cils shareholders coates also cooperated with the special master during the time that the special master was involved with the operations of cil finally it cannot be overlooked that coates was arrested and spent five days in jail at the commencement of this action given the above factors and considering them within the context of all of the facts and circumstances this court finds that coates should be assessed civil penalties in the amount of  per violation this court has discussed four violations of the exchange act and therefore coates is ordered to pay a civil penalty of  to the treasury of the united states d interest held by escrow agent having resolved the issue of summary judgment and civil penalties this court vacates the august   stay of the august   order to pay interest to the quintas trust and rainer heubach this court therefore orders the escrow agent to oversee the distribution of the monies held in the escrow account to the quintas trust and rainer heubach iii conclusion for the reasons detailed above the commissions motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part coates motion for a finding that no civil penalties shall be assessed is denied the court finds that coates has violated federal securities laws and orders that coates pay  to the treasury of the united states this court also vacates the august   stay and orders the escrow agent to oversee the payment of interest to the quintas trust and rainer heubach from the monies held in the escrow account designated for this purpose the
