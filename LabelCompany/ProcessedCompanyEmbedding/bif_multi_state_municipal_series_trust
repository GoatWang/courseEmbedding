to the issuer is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes but may subject investors to federal alternative minimum tax and exempt from any applicable state or local income or other taxes arizona municipal securities arizona municipal securities consist principally of municipal notes and commercial paper shortterm municipal bonds variable rate demand obligations and shortterm municipal derivative securities the fund may also invest in repurchase agreements and purchase and sale contracts   under normal circumstances the fund will generally invest at least  of its assets in arizona municipal securities   principal risks of investing in the fund   arizona fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its objectives    an investment in the fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the fund defaults or if shortterm interest rates rise sharply in a manner not anticipated by fund management although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at  per share it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund the following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the fund   n   credit enhanced securities risk  the fund may invest more than  of its assets in arizona municipal securities secured by bank letters of credit the bank may not be able to meet its obligations under a letter of credit   n   credit risk  credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal when due changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the funds investment in that issuer   n   income risk  income risk is the risk that the funds yield will vary as shortterm securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest rates   n   interest rate risk  interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise in general the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities        additionally securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however due to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the fund   n   market risk and selection risk  market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the fund invests will go down in value including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by fund management will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies this means you may lose money   n   municipal securities risks  municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation the relative lack of information about certain issuers of municipal securities and the possibility of future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities certain municipal securities including private activity bonds are not backed by the full faith credit and taxing power of the issuer additionally if events occur after the security is acquired that impact the securitys taxexempt status the fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax liabilities   n   nondiversification risk  the fund is a nondiversified fund because the fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers it may be more exposed to the risks associated with and adverse developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely   n   repurchase agreements and purchase and sale contracts risks  if the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on its obligation under the agreement the fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement if the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines the fund may lose money   n   state specific risk  the fund will invest primarily in arizona municipal securities as a result the fund is more exposed to risks affecting issuers of arizona municipal securities   n   taxability risk  future laws regulations rulings or court decisions may cause interest on municipal securities to be subject directly or indirectly to federal income taxation or interest on state municipal securities to be subject to state or local income taxation or the value of state municipal securities to be subject to state or local intangible personal property tax or may otherwise prevent the fund from realizing the full current benefit of the taxexempt status of such securities any such change could also affect the market price of such securities and thus the value of an investment in the fund   n   variable rate demand obligations and municipal or taxexempt derivatives risk  investments in variable rate demand obligations or shortterm municipal or taxexempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect to the financial institution providing the fund with the right to demand payment or put sell the security while the fund invests only in shortterm municipal or taxexempt securities of high quality issuers or which are backed by high quality financial institutions those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations shortterm municipal or taxexempt derivatives present certain
