yearend is december    unaudited interim financial information the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission the sec to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year these unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company for the year ended december   and notes thereto contained in the information as part of the companys annual report on form k which was filed with the sec on april     discontinued operations on february   the board of directors of original source entertainment authorized the spinoff of the companys whollyowned subsidiary original source music inc to shareholders of record as of february   all of the companys assets and business operations at that time were held in original source music inc the spinoff was done in connection with a change of control of original source entertainment under the terms of the spinoff the company’s common shares par value  per share would be distributed on a prorata basis to each holder of original source entertainment’s common shares on the record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders and the holders of original source entertainment’s common shares as of the record date would become owners of  percent of our common shares   on may   the spinoff was completed due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the securities and exchange commission to the form  and the form ’s effectiveness   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates    income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates at each balance sheet date the company evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management’s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized   basic and diluted earnings loss per share the company computes earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period  diluted earnings loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  dilutive earnings loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive          during the three months ended march   and  the company did have potentially dilutive debt instruments outstanding that has been excluded from the earnings per share calculation as such an inclusion would have been antidilutive due to losses incurred by the company in both period and therefore basic and diluted earnings loss per share are equal in both periods   recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company other than those relating to development stage entities as discussed above   note  going concern   the company has suffered a loss from operations and has negative cash flows from

substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities through an offering of debt securities or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties by doing so the company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan of licensing songs to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies on an ongoing basis management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern   note  advances payable  related party   in support of the company’s efforts and cash requirements it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing there is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders  amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities the advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note   as of march   and december   the amount outstanding was  and  respectively the advances are noninterest bearing due upon demand and unsecured    note  spinoff   on february   the board of directors of original source entertainment authorized the spinoff of the companys whollyowned subsidiary original source music inc to shareholders of record as of february   all of the companys assets and business
