baby tracker mimo  mobihealthnews skip to main content toggle navigation rest devices raises m for baby tracker mimoby aditi paidecember   share bostonbased rest devices maker of baby tracking device mimo raised  million from experiment fund andy palmer founder of koa labs and nuland  arshad according to an sec filing the company will use the money to bring its product to market we are launching sales in mid january as well as bringing two additional products to market and growing our team cofounder dulcie madden told mobihealthnews the two other products her team is working on are within the smart baby space as well and will work with the mimo system although they are still six months from market rest devices flagship product mimo is a onesie with a pocket for a sensor which the company calls the turtle this sensor checks the baby for breathing temperature and sleeping patterns the turtle sensor transfers information to the lillypad base station via bluetooth smart which the company says is safe for infants and the base station will connect to the companion app available on ios and android using wifi rest devices raised  in the summer of  under the name nyx devices which the company used to bring its core technology beyond the prototype we were looking at design for manufacturing reliability durability everything as well as bringing it into a smart baby monitor suite that we have now madden said madden believes mimo is different from other baby trackers because its positioning on the babys body helps provide more accurate data and the app can then show parents their babys different health patterns i think the fact that we are able to store all the data we can do enhanced analytics and looking at trends madden said i think that our form factor just looking at a onesie is really relatable and its also really durable it can go through as many washes as theyll need over the course of the onesie and its soft and cute and organic cotton the device launches in january  and will be sold in a package with three mimo baby body suits one lilypad base station and one turtle sensor for  the company used to be known as nyx devices but was rebranded because the name was confusing to consumers madden said as nyx devices the company developed a sensorembedded sleep shirt for adults called somnus sleep shirt and while the company is still working with a few researchers on the shirt they are mainly focused on mimo right now mimo is just a consumer product madden said the sensors themselves have been tested pretty rigorously and down the road wed love to be able to look at a more clinical use but right now we definitely just want to work with moms and dads who are regular consumers tags andy palmer experiment fund mimo nuland  arshad nyx devices rest
