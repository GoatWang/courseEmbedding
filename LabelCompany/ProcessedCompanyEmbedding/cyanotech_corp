we have developed advanced technology which combined with our location on the pristine kona coast of the big island of hawaii allows us to produce unialgal contaminationfree products our most advanced technology is used for the production of bioastin natural astaxanthin products from haematococcus microalgae the initial production of haematococcus takes place in closed culture systems some as large as  liters this is followed by a short  to  day reddening cycle conducted in  liter open culture ponds at each stage of bioastin production haematococcus cultures are closely monitored by microscopic examination to ensure the cultures are pure and free from contaminating organisms after the reddening cycle haematococcus cultures are harvested washed and dried the final step for the production of bioastin is extraction of dried haematococcus biomass using supercritical carbon dioxide to produce a purified oleoresin absolutely free of any biological or environmental contamination this supercritical extraction process is a critical step ensuring the proper potency purity and quality of bioastin natural astaxanthin there is a general misconception that closed culture production of microalgal products eliminates contamination from unwanted organisms this is not true closed culture systems can and are contaminated by unwanted algae fungi and protozoa when this does occur elimination of the biological contamination in closed culture systems can be very difficult because of the high surface area and many nooks and crannies in such systems indeed persistent contamination of closed culture systems has led to serious problems for microalgae companies in california hawaii not cyanotech and europe cyanotechs closed culture systems as well as its open pond systems have been designed based on many years of experience to minimize problems and to ensure production of contaminationfree microalgal products cyanotechs natural astaxanthin production holds a food establishment permit from the state of hawaii department of health for manufacturing and processing we are also cgmp and operate under us food and drug administration fda guidelines each lot of bioastin natural astaxanthin goes through rigorous quality control to ensure the highest quality and purity in addition to unsurpassed quality and purity our many years of experience and proprietary technology allow us to produce far greater quantities of natural astaxanthin than our competitors and we maintain a market share at over  of the animal nutrition market for algaebased astaxanthin
