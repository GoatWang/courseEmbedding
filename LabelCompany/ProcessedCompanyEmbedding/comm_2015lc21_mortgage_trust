aa sf previously on jun   definitive rating assigned aa sf cl xa affirmed aa sf previously on jun   definitive rating assigned aa sf ratings rationale the ratings on the six pi classes were affirmed because the transactions key metrics including moodys loantovalue ltv ratio moodys stressed debt service coverage ratio dscr and the transactions herfindahl index herf are within acceptable ranges the

of  of the current balance moodys provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion cmbs transactions on moodyscom at httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously expected factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance factors that could lead to a downgrade of the

moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility
