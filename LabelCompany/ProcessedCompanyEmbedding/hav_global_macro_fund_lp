composite includes all accounts that are managed according to the firm’s global macro hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion this hedge fund strategy has a broad and flexible mandate the strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an activelymanaged prudentlydiversified multiassetclass portfolio of liquid global securities the manager follows a multidisciplinary valuebased investment process with risk controls the strategy blends topdown macroeconomic analysis with bottomup fundamental valuation the investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies commodities industries and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic themes that guide positions and exposures the largest asset class exposure is large and midcap global equities long and short with a long bias the manager trades and invests in individual equities as well as exchangetraded funds and related options the manager also takes long and short positions in currencies commodities and fixed income securities primarily through liquid exchangelisted futures and options contracts the manager may take limited positions in overthecounter derivatives the strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities the strategy’s bottomup approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary fundamental quantitative model that was originally built in  by the firm’s chief investment officer kevin c smith cfa the model applies an innovative and robust discountedfreecashflow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top  largest and mostliquid global equities that trade on a us exchange the fundamental quant model has been consistently refined and applied to managing this strategy since its inception the investment team performs additional qualitative analysis to validate buy and sell signals generated by the model and to integrate modeldriven ideas with the firm’s macro themes the goal of the strategy is to generate high riskadjusted returns as measured by alpha sortino ratio omega ratio and gainloss ratio that are in the top
