investment fund fund i fund ii geography california initial investment nov   date of dispositiondec   in the late 0s haddington perceived a need for development of high deliverability natural gas storage projects in the western united states california was beginning to deregulate several segments of the energy industry at the time of whp’s inception haddington believed california had insufficient natural gas storage capacity to stabilize the energy market california demand was growing dramatically in excess of national rates while little investment was being made in natural gas infrastructure california was encouraging new entrants into the natural gas market and the supply profile was expected to change through the development of new market options for the midwest by canadian producers via the then proposed alliance pipeline and the previously announced expansions on transcanada and northern border in haddington’s view deregulation encourages the development of new services and assets and ultimately leads to commodity price volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand high deliverability storage can stabilize fluctuating supply and demandin  haddington formed western hub properties whp as a provider of cost efficient energy storage services to traditional gas users and independent power producers haddington presented whp with an opportunity to develop a project located near lodi california haddington used its proprietary methodology of calculating storage value to predict that the lodi project would generate acceptable rates of return
