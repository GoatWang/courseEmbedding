financial markets ‘there is a bubble in everything’ by sue chang published june    am et share faber some day tesla amazon and netflix will fall  by suechang markets reporter bloomberg news marc faber managing director of marc faber ltd warns that us stocks are looking a lot like they did in  famed investor marc faber known as dr doom for his gloomy views believes the us markets are in the midst of a gigantic bubble and when the day of reckoning comes investors will likely lose half of their money “there is a bubble in everything nothing in asset price is very low” said faber during an interview on cnbc wednesday his grim prognosis shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to permabear faber over the years still the fact that his latest warning comes on the heels of a historic rally that has propelled stocks to records lends some urgency to his grim outlook “we are somewhere between  to ” he said referring to the tech bubble and its subsequent collapse “one day this bubble will end” said faber when that happens people will lose  of their assets concerns about elevated valuations in the us have been mounting given the sp  spx  and the dow jones industrial average’s djia   doubledigit gains since november on hopes that president donald trump’s presidency will usher in a more businessfriendly climate “i don’t disagree trump is good for the markets and economy but some of his statements and actions are not favorable for the us” said faber indeed the euphoria that has gripped the market since the november presidential election has faded as trump struggles to enact many of his promised policies yet most analysts still believe the bullish market thesis remains intact not so faber he thinks consumption is relatively weak for this stage of the economic recovery and predicted that as financialasset prices rise wages will deflate and the us economy will further weaken all that said nothing would make him bullish on the us market faber

nasdaq composite comp   to gain nearly  over the past six months one of the first warnings signals that the market is shifting will be when volatility picks up but even the lack of volatility has managed to perplex the switzerlandbased investor “i do not understand why volatility is so low but when stocks go up as volatility goes up that will be a sign that something is changing” he said the cboe volatility index vix  which measures investors’ expectation for volatility over the coming  days has been eerily subdued with the monthly average of  in may the lowest since november  according to dow jones data group faber meanwhile likes us treasurys given they guarantee a “certain yield” and particularly given the nearzero interest rates in japan and much of europe but treasurys may be the only us asset to escape his disdain even if arguably they are facing their own bubble he prefers european assets and gold and  of his investment in stocks and bonds are emerging markets more from
