quarter we continued our focus on accelerating sales and marketing campaigns for our key revenue generating initiatives although revenue declined yearoveryear revenues remain stable on a sequential basis and we were encouraged by the increases in our prepaid revenues as a result of our standout product enhancements as well as solid momentum in our pinless debit services which we introduced late last year our operating expenses were down on an absolute basis when compared to a year ago we continue to generate cash flow from operations and our balance sheet remains strong with a cash position of  million and no debt as of march st above all we remain diligently focused on our sales and marketing campaigns for our key revenue generating initiatives and today im pleased to share some updates in our payments network we were encouraged by the growth of transactions and dollars processed from our new pinless debit service offering and our anticipating future growth through the adoption of this product by more of our existing clients its the higher margin product for us than our ach offering and we believe clients will move from traditionally ach to pinless due to its real time capability ach processing continues to be our core business and we have a strong sales pipeline and we continue to expand our ach capabilities by bringing on more sponsoring banks to provide our customers with increased flexibility and risk mitigation services now id like to turn over the call to houston frost to give us update on our prepaid business houston houston frost thanks louis in prepaid we continue to focus our sales marketing and product development efforts on three core solutions corporate gift incentive or promotional cards turnkey prepaid card program management and processing services and our direct to consumer product akimbo the prepaid card divisions revenues increased by  in q  as compared to q of  primarily as a result of our digital card platform that we launched at money  last fall as previously discussed this new platform powers a new way to issue and deliver prepaid cards and weve employed the technology across all of our corporate and consumer card solutions and services corporations can deliver promotional rewards cards electronically and consumers can use this card for purchases immediately both instore and online in addition our consumer customers can receive a digital akimbo card in real time now through the akimbo app that allows them to engage with the product before a plastic card arrives in the mail specifically weve seen more than  digital cards created since the beginning of this year while this growth has been largely driven by a single client it demonstrates the viability and scalability of the platform and we look to leverage this successful role out to increase sales of digital gift incentive and promotional cards we have three new whitelabel prepaid programs set to launch in q  and our sales pipeline for prepaid card program management processing services is larger than ever we expect to launch at least six additional whitelabel or cobranded card programs this year and these programs should account for a significant portion of the prepaid card divisions revenue in  as an update on the last earnings call the new akimbo card website web and mobile apps are now live the updates represent the most significant product enhancements and branding updates since akimbos acquisition in december of  in addition we begun to ramp up our marketing efforts for this flagship consumer product in our first few weeks weve seen the enrollment rate for the akimbo card doubled and we plan to increase our efforts in june we fully expect these ongoing marketing efforts will revive the consistent monthovermonth growth akimbo experienced prior to the acquisition ill turn it back over to louis now for additional updates on the company louis hoch in corporate news in march we announced our intent to acquire singular payments a fintech payments provider for merchants in healthcare and other niche markets nationwide we believe this is an important acquisition and is well aligned to our growth strategy and will dramatically broaden our revenue streams were in the final stages of due diligence and remain hopeful that we will be able to close the transaction in the near future last week we announced addition of a new board member mr brad rollins has agreed to join our board of directors and will serve on a nomination compensation and audit committees hes the chief executive officer of dahill office technology and his relationship should help position our company to gain new revenue opportunities the addition of mr rollins to our board brings our company back in due compliance with

june   am central time at the hilton garden inn san antonio airport we look forward to seeing many of shareholders at that meeting now ill turn the call over to tom for our financial review tom jewell thank you louis and good afternoon i will provide a brief review of our financial results before we turn the call over for questions as we have discussed last quarter we continue to have a strong balance sheet with  million in cash we don’t have any debt and have a clean capital structure for the first three months of  we generated net cash from operations of  for the first quarter of  our revenues were  million down  from the first quarter of last year this was a result of a decrease in the volume of ach processing credit card and return transactions process as well as some customer attrition the revenue decline was somewhat offset by increase in our pinless debit cards which launched last october as louis mentioned gross margin dollars came in at  or  of revenues this compared to  million and  of revenues in the first quarter of last year we are very pleased to see flat gross margin as a percentage of revenue our first quarter operating loss was  compared to an operating loss of  in the first quarter of last year and this difference reflects higher sga as a percentage of revenue on an adjusted ebitda basis we were positive  compared to  in the first quarter of last year net loss for the quarter was  or  per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of  or  per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of last year in closing we remain a healthy company debt free and generating positive cash flow we are well positioned for future growth operator we will open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instruction our first question comes from ron nisser a private investor please go ahead unidentified analyst sir ive followed michael long in houston  and in my opinion your company  the company looks stronger than it ever has in the past that being said i have a couple of quick questions here that i am sure you can answer first of all you made mention to another board of director being nominated and pyds and the symbol ssid noncompliance or displayed at online brokerage firms how long will symbol ssid remain louis hoch well i am not sure what ssid refers to but i assume that it means because we were short a board of director and temporarily our of nasdaq compliance unidentified analyst that’s correct and i would like to see it disappear soon as possible that’s the reason i brought it up louis hoch we have made nasdaq aware that weve added an independent board of director and im sure that theyll act on that very quickly unidentified analyst okay if they don’t ill it to my brokerage house attention the electronic bill payment processing and handling it needs all the third party help and security it can get can will must payment data systems phone number pdspays adopt digital voice recognition that helps verify accounts and guards against hack attacks and ransom worms louis hoch im not sure how voice has do with hacking but i can assure you all of our systems are very secure they exceed industry standards all of our data is encrypted and i dont know what else we can do besides remain diligent and focused on security and keeping everybodys credit card numbers and bank accounts secure unidentified analyst i know youre doing all that you can and i know that the payment industry is going through a sea change and theres talk  of course not talk but theres going to be a revisions or should be sometime in the foreseeable future of rules and regulations that govern paying with plastic paying with the plastic industry also id like to see you work with encrypted email transaction confirmations that once money is transferred for me to be in between and through the automatic clearing house customers when they get an email its encrypted so they can be through some of these ransom worms and hack attacks that being said ill hang up now ive no other questions keep up the good work and i believe youre on track and i wish everybody the best louis hoch thank you operator operator instructions at this time im showing no further questions i would like to turn the floor back to louis hoch for any closing remarks louis

homes exterior it will also expand when warm and contract when cool which means it will hold up in all types of weatherhiring a painterwhen embarking on a project as big as painting your home its important to know ahead of time what kind of quality you can expect from the painters you hire dont settle for the first one you find or the cheapest option instead do your homework to be sure that you hire a trustworthy professional who knows how to paint a house wellthe first thing youll do when hiring a painter is request quotes from three or four in your area if you reach out to too many youll wind up wasting time narrowing down your list too few and you may not end up with the best quality or right pricethe typical price range for an interior paint job is between  and  with the average falling around  depending on the scope of the project and paint requests it will typically cost around  to  to paint a typical by​ foot roomthe cost to paint a homes exterior is a little higher between  and  with an average of  the typical home of between  and  square feet will generally cost between  and  but this will change depending on the number of stories and home locationif a quote seems high ask the contractor what is increasing the price point perhaps its something that can be negotiated or maybe this business is just overpricing their services on the other hand be skeptical of any price points that seem unfathomably low there could be a reason their prices are below the industry norm  perhaps their quality standards are uncommonly low tooonce you have quotes conduct an overthephone interview with your prospects some important questions to ask your painter include do you have insuranceits never a good idea to hire a contractor whose business isnt properly insured ask both about comprehensive business liability insurance and workers compensation and dont be hesitant to ask for proof if you are unsure of the validity of the insurance you can also call the insurance company to doublecheck that it is an active policy do you have a warrantynot offering a warranty is a red flag and you may want to be cautious about hiring a company that doesnt provide one if they have a warranty ask how long it lasts and what it covers additionally youll want to get the warranty in writing should you need to refer to it later who specifically will be in my house and can i trust themyou always have a right to know who will be entering your home if the person you are speaking with says he or she will not be personally supervising the project ask who will be what their role is and how long theyve been with the companyalso dont be afraid to ask if the painters are trustworthy people unfortunately there are plenty of cases where a painter has stolen items from a home or caused damage to the house or injury to the homeowner subcontractors may not be as skilled as employees and the contractor youre hiring may not have much experience working with them making them more of a risk additionally ask if the painters are employees or subcontractors and what the screening or hiring process is like if the company conducts background checks thats a good sign  what kind of training do your employees receiveif the contractor makes a point to train new hires on safety techniques as well as quality standards on the job youre probably in good hands what kind of paint will you usethe quality of the paint will affect how good the walls look when the project is completed if your contractor says they plan on using a paint you dont like feel free to request an alternative how long have you been in business and do you have referencesa wellestablished company will have more experience and likely more references for you to reach out to than a new company thats just getting off the ground be sure to ask for references so you can speak to former customers about their experience working with the painter when speaking to these people ask aboutwhether they had issues with the crewif the painters were messy or neathow the paint has held up since the project was completed how much wall prep is included in the pricefor a longlasting paint job a clean wall is crucial ask how they plan to clean your walls if at all before getting started a highquality company will thoroughly prepare a wall so that the paint will lay smoothly and last a
