has enabled the world’s oil and gasproducing giants to increase their well productivity design anywhere build anywhere is an ambitious goal for any global manufacturer but especially so for weatherford one of the worlds largest providers of oilfield equipment and services wherever there is oil weatherford is represented says bill droke an it director responsible for the companys integrated enterprise resource planning erp and product lifecycle management plm systems weatherford is a multinational organization headquartered in geneva switzerland with operations in over  countries the company operates  technology and training centers approximately  service and manufacturing facilities over  weatherford employees are dedicated to helping the worlds oil and gasproducing giants increase their well productivity oil and gas companies apply weatherfords technology across the span of a wells lifecycle – from drilling and evaluation through completion and production intervention systems are another weatherford specialty they help oil and gas producers remedy problems and optimize yields from underperforming wells worldwide about a decade ago weatherford committed to taking the design anywhere build anywhere concept from an industry ideal to a company imperative they resolved to reorganize their operations around a global erp platform with integrated plm as a missioncritical component why plm simple says droke we needed to get control over our product data more than ever we began to think of our parts designs as critical company assets our investments in erp and plm are entirely aimed at improving inventory and asset management throughout our global supply chain layers of complexity from the erpplm initiatives start weatherford set out to build a single centralized database of their product information they envisioned the system to be comprehensive in scope with parts consistently identified and extensively attributed users should be able to access the data quickly and easily – at any time from any place given the companys worldwide operations delivering these capabilities would be no simple task but that was only one complicating factor product engineering in the oilfield industry may be like nowhere else says lewis lawrence weatherfords plm process owner while there are standard products that we design and manufacture there are critical products we provide that are specifically engineered to the well conditions they will be used in theyre designed configured and built to order weatherfords parts – especially those for downhole uses – are generally machined from raw bar stock and they may use materials that other industries would view as exotic an example is inconel a superalloy primarily based on nickel and chromium production is limited but a products lifecycle may be very long repeat orders are often  years or more apart lawrence says with designs for parts coming from so many sources it can be easy to lose track the original data may be hard to find what weatherford has especially aimed to avoid notes lawrence is the need to reengineer parts that already exist this adds time and cost to product development bottomline impact another plm challenge has been organizational over the years weatherford has grown through acquisitions the firm is today a melding of more than  acquired companies and for every new engineering team weve brought on board says lawrence weve taken on another set of legacy systems for numbering and describing parts the supply chain adds layers of complexity weatherfords biggest customer lawrence notes is weatherford that is most production in the companys plants is to fulfill internal sales to their own service organization weatherfords service sites then rent and operate the equipment when performing services for the oil and gas companies under service contracts weatherford also relies on thousands of thirdparty manufacturers to produce short runs of specialized parts the companys suppliers are mostly small companies many says lawrence are in wayoutoftheway places close to our customers wells this makes for a lot of additional – and a lot of different – product data to coordinate on top of all that delivery deadlines are tight if weatherford delays getting equipment to a site the customer may waste precious drilling time and fall behind on production theres a huge bottomline impact from being on time says lawrence we cant be held up by problems with product data for our customers its a matter of productivity for us it can be the difference between getting the next service contract – or not quality in quality out weatherford uses an oracle erp system with ptcs windchill system as the plm front end users create parts with computeraided design cad tools and weatherfords plmdriven release to production rtp process tightly controls approvals before transferring the parts information to erp key engineering and manufacturing personnel automatically receive notification when a new or updated part design reaches released status the systems are so intertwined says droke that erp users interact with our plm tools and data without really knowing it weatherfords ongoing acquisition of companies means that adoption of the integrated erpplm systems remains a work in process yet there is no doubt it has firmly taken hold there are now more than  daytoday plm users at weatherford the product database holds nearly a million part masters and over a million secondary part numbers each month weatherford users add nearly  new part numbers nearly  part revisions and over  engineering change requests to the system by drokes estimate approximately  of weatherfords business transactions now occur through the erpplm systems as he puts it if windchill is unavailable our ability to respond to business demand is severely impacted quality of product data is allimportant says lawrence heres my philosophy live like there is no tomorrow manage data like it will live forever he elaborates i may be stating the obvious here but the information contained in plm is what gives the system value bad data is worse than no data inconsistent data is bad data the system doesnt create data nor does it fix data quality in quality out lawrence adds with apologies to the credit card commercials – good data priceless classification is crucial careful parts classification helps to eliminate duplicate part designs and ensure the high quality of weatherfords product data the companys classification team engages with subject matter experts to comb data throughout the many legacy systems and find equivalences in part designs they then create new part numbers and where possible map the existing legacy number to existing parts in the system with descriptions in standard formats for consistent use in bills of materials and other applications up to  attributes per part aid in distinguishing items geometrically identical parts can be described from the same drawing this attributedriven approach says lawrence helps to deskill part variant creation often generating a new repeated part from different materials can be a clerical function no cad license is required classification helps weatherfords users quickly search for and retrieve required parts in an organization as widespread and diverse as ours droke says just having a plm system isnt enough its the classification of data that truly breaks down the silos of information its what makes easy search and retrieval a part of our everyday work life parts classification also enhances crossteam collaboration asserts lawrence it gets everyone on the same page both internally and throughout the supply chain our teams work better and faster when they can have confidence that their product data is complete accurate and up to date we can meet our customers needs more efficiently classification even creates synergies across business disciplines our integration of classified data structures product templates attributes and allowed values is interwoven into all aspects of our business process and supply chain says droke with engineering finance marketing and other weatherford departments sharing consistent product data they can perform sophisticated business analyses to find new opportunities for growth having classification and attribute data available in reports linked to erp data has enabled some groups to perform detailed business analysis looking at revenues for certain product lines or specific product models by geographic region customer and well types this type of reporting has sometimes led to more targeted marketing internally to weatherford staff and externally to customers data analysis showed for example that weatherford customers commonly needed certain sets of peripheral equipment this led the company to create companion parts kits linked to main assemblies – a valuable new tool for customer services helping ensure that orders contain everything the customer needs to use equipment prior to this capability customer services would often have to consult engineering directly or rely on product catalogues to ensure the required accessories were available to the customer the data thus helped us anticipate our customers needs and meet them innovatively says droke the trade compliance organization also depends heavily on product classification to make license and customs determinations for the companys international shipments droke points to weatherfords upfront commitment to classification launched as a phaseone task in their erpplm initiative – as a key to successful implementation yet as he makes clear companies must approach classification fully aware of its challenges its not a magic wand you can simply wave over your data and get everyone right in line he says classification is hard work its a major investment resistance overcome plm per lawrence makes engineering change management a closedloop process at weatherford the system strictly enforces what users need to do he says access controls prevent unauthorized design changes yet the system also steadily advances the process the whole purpose of engineering change management is to make the change says lawrence our customers cant put their oil rigs on hold waiting for an approved design change to be implemented lawrence notes that weatherfords plm system met some internal resistance at first some in the company he says were inclined to view it as a nuisance – something the man was forcing them to do but as good data was added and users began to access it regularly they saw the value and became champions of the system droke adds today design anywhere build anywhere is more than just a slogan at weatherford its reality the quality of our product data helps to make it so weatherford  managing product data that will live forever design anywhere build anywhere is more than just a slogan at weatherford the uk based oil field equipment and service provider product data management global collaboration and plm help to make it so learn how in this video x weatherford and
