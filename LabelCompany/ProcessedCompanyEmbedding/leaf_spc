control  wikipedia statistical process control from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search statistical process control spc is a method of quality control in which statistical methods are employed spc is applied in order to monitor and control a process monitoring and controlling the process ensures that it operates at its full potential at its full potential the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum if not an elimination of waste rework or scrap spc can be applied to any process where the conforming product product meeting specifications output can be measured key tools used in spc include control charts a focus on continuous improvement and the design of experiments an example of a process where spc is applied is

advantage of spc over other methods of quality control such as inspection is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems rather than the correction of problems after they have

to be reworked or scrapped limitationsedit spc is applied to reduce or eliminate process waste this in turn eliminates the need for the process step of postmanufacture inspection the success of spc relies not only on the skill with which it is applied but also on how suitable or amenable the process is to spc in some cases it may be difficult to judge when the application of spc is appropriatecitation needed historyedit spc was pioneered by walter a shewhart at bell laboratories in the early s shewhart developed the control chart in  and the concept of a state of statistical

characteristics are ever exactly the same because any process contains many sources of variability in massmanufacturing traditionally the quality of a finished article is ensured by postmanufacturing inspection of the product each article or a sample of articles from a production lot may be accepted or rejected according to how well it meets its design specifications in contrast spc uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to detect significant variations before they result in the production of a substandard article any source of variation at any point of time in a process will fall into one of two classes  common causes  sometimes referred to as nonassignable normal sources of variation it refers to many sources of variation that consistently acts on process these types of causes produce a stable and repeatable distribution over time  special causes  sometimes referred to as assignable sources of variation it refers to any factor causing variation that affects only some of the process output they are often intermittent and unpredictable most processes have many sources of variation most of them are minor and may be ignored if the dominant sources of variation are identified however resources for change can be focused on them if the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected potentially they can be identified and removed once removed the process is said to be stable when a process is stable its variation should remain within a known set of limits that is at least until another assignable source of variation occurs for example a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with  grams of cereal some boxes will have slightly more than  grams and some will have slightly less when the package weights are measured the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights if the production process its inputs or its environment for example the machines on the line change the distribution of the data will change for example as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box although this might benefit the customer from the manufacturers point of view this is wasteful and increases the cost of production if the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner the change can be corrected for example the cams and pulleys replaced application of spcedit the application of spc involves three main phases of activity understanding the process and the specification limits eliminating assignable special sources of variation so that the process is stable monitoring the ongoing production process assisted by the use of control charts to detect significant changes of mean or variation control chartsedit the data from measurements of variations at points on the process map is monitored using control charts control charts attempt to differentiate assignable special sources of variation from common sources common sources because they are an expected part of the process are of much less concern to the manufacturer than assignable sources using control charts is a continuous activity ongoing over time stable processedit when the process does not trigger any of the control chart detection rules for the control chart it is said

of variation once the sources of special cause variation are identified they can be minimized or eliminated steps to eliminating a source of variation might include development of standards staff

statistical process control  wikipedia statistical process control from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search statistical process control spc is a method of quality control in which statistical methods are employed spc is applied in order to monitor and control a process monitoring and controlling the process ensures that it operates at its full potential at its full potential the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum if not an elimination of waste rework or scrap spc can be applied to any process where the conforming product product meeting specifications output can be measured key tools used in spc include control charts a focus on continuous improvement and the design of experiments an example of a process where spc is applied is manufacturing lines contents  overview  objective analysis when there is command to configure the romance  emphasis on early detection  increasing rate of production  limitations  history  common and special sources of variation  application to nonmanufacturing processes  variation in manufacturing  application of spc  control charts  stable process  excessive variations  mathematics of control charts  see also  references  bibliography  external links overviewedit objective analysis when there is command to configure the romanceedit spc must be practiced in  phases the first phase is the initial establishment of the process and the second phase is the regular production use of the process in the second phase a decision of the period to be examined must be made depending upon the change in me conditions man machine material method measurement environment and wear rate of parts used in the manufacturing process machine parts jigs and fixture emphasis on early detectionedit an advantage of spc over other methods of quality control such as inspection is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems rather than the correction of problems after they have occurred increasing rate of productionedit in addition to reducing waste spc can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product spc makes it less likely the finished product will need to be reworked or scrapped limitationsedit spc is applied to reduce or eliminate process waste this in turn eliminates the need for the process step of postmanufacture inspection the success of spc relies not only on the skill with which it is applied but also on how suitable or amenable the process is to spc in some cases it may be difficult to judge when the application of spc is appropriatecitation needed historyedit spc was pioneered by walter a shewhart at bell laboratories in the early s shewhart developed the control chart in  and the concept of a state of statistical control statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeability developed by logician william ernest johnson also in  in his book logic part iii the logical foundations of science along with a team at att that included harold dodge and harry romig he worked to put sampling inspection on a rational statistical basis as well shewhart consulted with colonel leslie e simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the armys picatinny arsenal in  that successful application helped convince army ordnance to engage atts george edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of world war ii w edwards deming invited shewhart to speak at the graduate school of the us department of agriculture and served as the editor of shewharts book statistical method from the viewpoint of quality control  which was the result of that lecture deming was an important architect of the quality control short courses that trained american industry in the new techniques during wwii the graduates of these wartime courses formed a new professional society in  the american society for quality control which elected edwards as its first president deming traveled to japan during the allied occupation and met with the union of japanese scientists and engineers juse in an effort to introduce spc methods to japanese industry  common and special sources of variationedit main article common cause and special cause statistics shewhart read the new statistical theories coming out of britain especially the work of william sealy gosset karl pearson and ronald fisher however he understood that data from physical processes seldom produced a normal distribution curve that is a gaussian distribution or bell curve he discovered that data from measurements of variation in manufacturing did not always behave the way as data from measurements of natural phenomena for example brownian motion of particles shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation some processes display variation that is natural to the process common sources of variation these processes were described as in statistical control other processes additionally display variation that is not present in the causal system of the process at all times special sources of variation and these were described as not in control application to nonmanufacturing processesedit in  the software engineering institute suggested that spc could be applied to nonmanufacturing processes such as software engineering processes in the capability maturity model cmm the level  and level  practices of the capability maturity model integration cmmi use this concept the notion that spc is a useful tool when applied to nonrepetitive knowledgeintensive processes such as research and development or systems engineering has encountered skepticism and remains controversial in his seminal article no silver bullet fred brooks points out that the complexity conformance requirements changeability and invisibility of software results in inherent and essential variation that cannot be removed this implies that spc is less effective in the domain of software development than in eg manufacturing variation in manufacturingedit in manufacturing quality is defined as conformance to specification however no two products or characteristics are ever exactly the same because any process contains many sources of variability in massmanufacturing traditionally the quality of a finished article is ensured by postmanufacturing inspection of the product each article or a sample of articles from a production lot may be accepted or rejected according to how well it meets its design specifications in contrast spc uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to detect significant variations before they result in the production of a substandard article any source of variation at any point of time in a process will fall into one of two classes  common causes  sometimes referred to as nonassignable normal sources of variation it refers to many sources of variation that consistently acts on process these types of causes produce a stable and repeatable distribution over time  special causes  sometimes referred to as assignable sources of variation it refers to any factor causing variation that affects only some of the process output they are often intermittent and unpredictable most processes have many sources of variation most of them are minor and may be ignored if the dominant sources of variation are identified however resources for change can be focused on them if the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected potentially they can be identified and removed once removed the process is said to be stable when a process is stable its variation should remain within a known set of limits that is at least until another assignable source of variation occurs for example a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with  grams of cereal some boxes will have slightly more than  grams and some will have slightly less when the package weights are measured the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights if the production process its inputs or its environment for example the machines on the line change the distribution of the data will change for example as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box although this might benefit the customer from the manufacturers point of view this is wasteful and increases the cost of production if the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner the change can be corrected for example the cams and pulleys replaced application of spcedit the application of spc involves three main phases of activity understanding the process and the specification limits eliminating assignable special sources of variation so that the process is stable monitoring the ongoing production process assisted by the use of control charts to detect significant changes of mean or variation control chartsedit the data from measurements of variations at points on the process map is monitored using control charts control charts attempt to differentiate assignable special sources of variation from common sources common sources because they are an expected part of the process are of much less concern to the manufacturer than assignable sources using control charts is a continuous activity ongoing over time stable processedit when the process does not trigger any of the control chart detection rules for the control chart it is said to be stable a process capability analysis may be performed on a stable process to predict the ability of the process to produce conforming product in the future excessive variationsedit when the process triggers any of the control chart detection rules or alternatively the process capability is low other activities may be performed to identify the source of the excessive variation the tools used in these extra activities include ishikawa diagram designed experiments and pareto charts designed experiments are a means of objectively quantifying the relative importance strength of sources of variation once the sources of special cause variation are identified they can be minimized or eliminated steps to eliminating a source of variation might include development of standards staff training errorproofing and changes to the process itself or its inputs mathematics of control chartsedit digital control charts use logicbased rules that determine derived values which signal the need for correction for example derived value  last value  average absolute difference between the last n numbers see alsoedit process capability index quality assurance industrial engineering anova gauge
