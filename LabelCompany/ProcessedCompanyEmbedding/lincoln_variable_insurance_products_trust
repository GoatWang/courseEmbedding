management investment company under the  act the trust currently consists of and offers shares of beneficial interest in thirtyone investment portfolios that are sold only to separate accounts of insurance companies in conjunction with variable start printed page life and variable annuity contracts or to other registered investment companies that sell their shares only to such separate accounts as part of a “fundoffunds” arrangement liac a tennessee corporation and a whollyowned subsidiary of lincoln national corporation is registered with the commission as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended and serves as investment adviser to the trust the trust may offer one or more additional investment portfolios or classes of shares in the future  the trust sells its shares directly or indirectly to lincoln life and its affiliate lincoln life  annuity company of new york each of which holds the shares in its separate accounts to support variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts lincoln life is an indiana insurance company that serves as administrator and sponsor of the trust lincoln life is licensed to do business in all states except new york and the district of columbia guam and the virgin islands lincoln life is a wholly owned subsidiary of lincoln national corporation a publicly held insurance holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of indiana  shares of the trust are not offered directly to the public but currently are sold directly or indirectly only to the separate accounts of lincoln life and lincoln life  annuity company of new york collectively the “life companies” to fund benefits under flexible premium variable life insurance policies or variable annuity contracts each life company is an affiliated person of the other life company the separate accounts of the life companies include both separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the  act and separate accounts that are not registered as investment companies under the  act in reliance on an exclusion from the definition of “investment company” provided by section  of the  act  the insurance investment companies propose to also offer shares of the insurance funds to registered and unregistered separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies collectively with separate accounts of affiliated insurance companies “separate accounts” in order to fund various types of insurance products these products may include but are not limited to variable annuity contracts scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts single premium variable life insurance contracts and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts collectively referred to herein as “variable contracts” or “contracts” insurance companies whose separate accounts may now or in the future own shares of the insurance funds are referred to herein as “participating insurance companies”  the participating insurance companies established or will establish their own separate accounts and designed or will design their own variable contracts each participating insurance company has or will have the legal obligation to satisfy all applicable requirements under both state and federal law participating insurance companies may rely on rule e or rule et under the  act in connection with the establishment and maintenance of variable life insurance separate accounts although some participating insurance companies in connection with variable life insurance contracts may rely on individual exemptive orders as well  each participating insurance company will enter into a participation agreement with the applicable insurance investment company on behalf of the insurance funds in which the participating insurance company invests the role of the insurance funds under this arrangement insofar as federal securities laws are applicable will consist of offering their shares to the separate accounts and fulfilling any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein  the insurance investment companies propose to offer shares of the insurance funds directly to qualified plans outside of the separate account context qualified plans may choose any of the insurance funds that are offered as the sole investment under the plan or as one of several investments plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the plan itself shares of any of the insurance funds sold to such qualified plans would be held or deemed to be held by the trustees of said plans certain qualified plans including section b plans and section a plans may vest voting rights in plan participants instead of plan trustees exercise of voting rights by participants in any such qualified plans as opposed to the trustees of such plans cannot be mandated by the applicants each plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees  shares of each insurance investment company also may be offered to a manager and to general accounts treasury regulation fii permits such sales as long as inter alia the return on shares held by the manager is computed in the same manner as for shares held by the separate accounts and the manager does not intend to sell to the public shares of the insurance investment company that it holds applicants represent that sales in reliance on these provisions of the treasury regulation will be made to a manager consistent with these two conditions and for the purpose of providing seed capital any shares of an insurance fund purchased by the manager will automatically be redeemed if and when the managers investment advisory agreement terminates  applicants propose that the insurance funds also be permitted to offer andor sell shares to general accounts treasury regulation f permits sales to general accounts of insurance companies and their corporate affiliates as long as the return on shares held by such persons is computed in the same manner as for shares held by a separate account such persons do not intend to sell to the public shares of the insurance fund that they hold and a segregated asset account of the life insurance company whose general account holds those shares also holds or will hold a beneficial interest in the insurance fund applicants represent that sales to general accounts will be made consistent with these provisions applicants legal analysis  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account organized as a unit investment trust “trust account” rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as a depositor or principal underwriter of any trust account among other things if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in section a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares  the exemptions granted to an insurance company by rule eb are available only where each registered management investment company underlying the trust account “underlying fund” offers its shares “exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company   ” therefore the relief granted by start printed page rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company the use of a common underlying fund as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding”  in addition the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common underlying fund as the underlying investment medium for variable life insurance separate accounts of one insurance company and separate accounts funding variable contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding”  because the relief under rule eb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares of the insurance investment companies are also to be sold to a general account a qualified plan or the manager under the circumstances described in the application applicants note that if shares of the insurance funds are sold only to variable annuity separate accounts a qualified plan the manager and a general account exemptive relief under rule e would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to such proposed purchasers or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such proposed purchasers the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity and variable life separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies a qualified plan the manager and a general account is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding”  in connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a trust account rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act to the extent that those sections have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying funds shares the exemptions granted to a separate account by rule etb are available only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more underlying funds which offer their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company” therefore rule et permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account subject to certain conditions however rule et does not permit shared funding because the relief granted by rule etb is not available with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts including variable annuity and flexible premium and scheduled premium variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies  the relief provided by rule et is not relevant to the purchase of shares of the insurance investment companies by qualified plans the manager or general accounts however because the relief granted by rule etb is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to separate accounts or to life insurers in connection with the operation of a separate account additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares of the insurance investment companies are also to be sold to qualified plans the manager or general accounts  applicants maintain that none of the relief provided for in rules eb and etb relates to qualified plans the manager or general accounts or to an underlying funds ability to sell its shares to such purchasers it is only because some of the separate accounts that may invest in the insurance investment companies may themselves be investment companies that rely upon the relief provided by rules e and et and wish to continue to rely upon that relief provided in those rules that the applicants are applying for the requested relief  applicants represent that if and when a material irreconcilable conflict arises between the separate accounts or between separate accounts on the one hand and qualified plans the manager or general accounts on the other hand the participating insurance companies qualified plans and the manager must take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the conflict including eliminating the insurance funds as eligible investment options applicants submit that investment by the manager or the inclusion of qualified plans or general accounts as eligible shareholders should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts among shareholders applicants further maintain that even if a material irreconcilable conflict involving the qualified plans manager or general accounts arose the qualified plans manager or general accounts unlike the separate accounts can simply redeem their shares and make alternative investments by contrast insurance companies cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another time consuming complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers applicants submit that allowing the manager qualified plans or general accounts to invest directly in the insurance investment companies should not increase the opportunity for conflicts of interest  applicants state that paragraph  of section a provides among other things that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser to or principal underwriter for any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or a rule ebi and ii under the  act and rule etbi and ii under the  act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management or administration of the underlying fund  applicants submit that the relief provided by rules ebi and etbi under the  act permits a person disqualified under section a to serve as an officer director or employee of the life insurer or any of its affiliates so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii under the  act permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying funds investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that start printed page none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a are participating in the management or administration of the underlying fund the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the  act limits in effect the amount of monitoring of an insurers personnel which would otherwise be necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to the many individuals in an insurance company complex most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply section a of the  act to the many individuals employed by participating insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies who do not directly participate in the administration or management of the insurance investment companies  applicants submit that there is no regulatory purpose in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of section as eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding or shared funding many of the participating insurance companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the insurance investment companies those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the insurance investment companies will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or insurance companies use the insurance investment companies therefore applying the monitoring requirements of section a to the thousands of individuals employed by the participating insurance companies would not serve any regulatory purpose furthermore the increased monitoring costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners and plan participants applicants submit the relief requested should not be affected by the sale of shares of the insurance investment companies to qualified plans the manager or general accounts under the circumstances described in the application the insulation of the insurance investment companies from those individuals who are disqualified under the  act remains in place because qualified plans the manager and general accounts are not investment companies and will not be deemed to be affiliated with the insurance investment companies solely by virtue of their shareholdings no additional relief is necessary  sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to underlying fund shares held by a separate account applicants maintain that rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide partial exemptions from those sections to permit the insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners in certain limited circumstances rules ebiiia and etbiiia under the  act provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners in connection with the voting of shares of an underlying fund if such instructions would require such shares to be voted to cause such underlying funds to make or refrain from making certain investments that would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of such underlying funds or to approve or disapprove any contract between an underlying fund and its investment manager when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of such rules rules ebiiib and etbiiia under the  act provide that the insurance company may disregard contract owners voting instructions if the contract owners initiate any change in such underlying funds investment policies principal underwriter or any investment manager provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii and biib and c of rules e and et  applicants maintain rule e recognizes that a variable life insurance contract is an insurance contract it has important elements unique to insurance contracts and it is subject to extensive state regulation of insurance in adopting rule ebiii the commission expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters the commission also expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority to require an insurer to draw from its general account to cover costs imposed upon the insurer by a change approved by contract owners over the insurers objection the commission therefore deemed such exemptions necessary “to assure the solvency of the life insurer and performance of its contractual obligations by enabling an insurance regulatory authority or the life insurer to act when certain proposals reasonably could be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer” in this respect flexible premium variable life insurance contracts are identical to scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts therefore rule ets corresponding provisions presumably were adopted in recognition of the same factors  applicants submit that the insurance investment companies sale of shares to qualified plans the manager or general accounts under the circumstances described in the application will not have any impact on the relief requested in this regard shares of the insurance investment companies sold to qualified plans would be held by the trustees of such plans the exercise of voting rights by qualified plans whether by the trustees by participants by beneficiaries or by investment managers engaged by the plans does not present the type of issues respecting the disregard of voting rights that are presented by variable life separate accounts with respect to the qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to plan participants similarly the manager and general accounts are not subject to any passthrough voting requirements accordingly unlike the case with separate accounts the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with qualified plans the manager or general accounts  applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated participating insurance companies is in this respect no different than the use of the same start printed page investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated participating insurance companies which rules eb and etb permit under various circumstances affiliated participating insurance companies may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions discussed below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce  applicants assert that rules eb and etb give the insurance company the right to disregard the voting instructions of the contract owners applicants assert that the right under rules eb and etb of an insurance company to disregard contract owners voting instructions does not raise any issues different from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts under rules eb and etb an insurer can disregard contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items and under certain specified conditions affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et that the insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific goodfaith determinations however a particular participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the majority of contract owner voting instructions the participating insurance companys action could arguably be different than the determination of all or some of the other participating insurance companies including affiliated insurers that the contract owners voting instructions should prevail and could either preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the participating insurance company may be required at an insurance investment companys election to withdraw its separate accounts investment in that insurance investment company and no charge or penalty would be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  with respect to voting rights applicants submit that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving such voting rights to contract owners and to qualified plans the manager or general accounts the transfer agents for the insurance investment companies will inform each shareholder including each separate account each qualified plan the manager and each general account of its share ownership in an insurance investment company each participating insurance company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with the “passthrough” voting requirement investment by qualified plans or general accounts in any insurance investment company will similarly present no conflict the likelihood that voting instructions of insurance company contract owners will ever be disregarded or the possible withdrawal referred to above is extremely remote and this possibility will be known through prospectus disclosure to any qualified plan or general account choosing to invest in an insurance fund moreover even if a material irreconcilable conflict involving qualified plans or general accounts arises the qualified plans or general accounts may simply redeem their shares and make alternative investments  applicants assert that there is no reason that the investment policies of an insurance fund would or should be materially different from what they would or should be if such insurance fund funded only variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies whether flexible premium or scheduled premium policies each type of insurance product is designed as a longterm investment program similarly the investment strategy of qualified plans and general accounts ie longterm investment coincides with that of variable contracts and should not increase the potential for conflicts each of the insurance funds will be managed to attempt to achieve its investment objective and not to favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance product or other investor there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types of variable contracts the sale and ultimate success of all variable insurance products depends at least in part on satisfactory investment performance which provides an incentive for the participating insurance company to seek optimal investment performance  furthermore applicants assert that no one investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance product each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance needs and investment goals an insurance fund supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic justification for the growth of the insurance investment company in addition permitting mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of contract owners which will facilitate the establishment of additional insurance funds serving diverse goals the broader base of contract owners and shareholders can also be expected to provide economic justification for the creation of additional series of each insurance investment company with a greater variety of investment objectives and policies  applicants note that section h is the only section in the code where separate accounts are discussed section h imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity contracts and variable life contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies applicants submit that treasury regulation  which establishes the diversification requirements for such portfolios specifically permits in paragraph f among other things “qualified pension or retirement plans” “the general account of a life insurance company” “the manager    of an investment company” and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company the applicants therefore have concluded that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if qualified plans separate accounts the manager and general accounts all invest in the same underlying fund  applicants assert that the ability of the insurance investment companies to sell their shares directly to qualified plans the manager or general accounts does not create a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act with respect to any variable contract qualified plan manager or general account regardless of the rights and benefits of contract owners or qualified plan participants the separate accounts qualified plans the manager and the general accounts start printed page have rights only with respect to their respective shares of the insurance investment companies they can only redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of any of the insurance investment companies has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  applicants assert that permitting an insurance investment company to sell its shares to the manager in compliance with treasury regulation  will enhance insurance investment company management without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts  given the conditions of treasury regulation f under the code and the harmony of interest between an insurance investment company on the one hand and its managers or a participating insurance company on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists applicants assert that such investments should not implicate the concerns discussed regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts applicants assert that permitting investment by the manager or general accounts will encourage the orderly and efficient creation and operation of the insurance investment companies and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of insurance investment company operations  applicants assert that various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer variable contracts these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium the lack of expertise with respect to investment management principally with respect to stock and money market investments and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain participating insurance companies as investment experts in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contract business on their own use of the insurance investment companies as a common investment medium for variable contracts qualified plans and general accounts would help alleviate these concerns because participating insurance companies qualified plans and general accounts will benefit not only from the administrative expertise of lincoln life and its affiliates as well as the investment expertise of any investment manager to an insurance fund but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds therefore making the insurance investment companies available for mixed and shared funding and permitting the purchase of insurance investment company shares by qualified plans and general accounts may encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts and this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges mixed and shared funding also may benefit variable contract owners by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds furthermore granting the requested relief should result in an increased amount of assets available for investment by the insurance investment companies this may benefit variable contract owners by promoting economies of scale by reducing risk through greater diversification due to increased money in the insurance investment companies or by making the addition of new insurance funds more feasible applicants conditions applicants and the manager agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the trust as well as any future insurance investment company that relies on the order  a majority of the board of trustees or board of directors “board” of each insurance investment company shall consist of persons who are
