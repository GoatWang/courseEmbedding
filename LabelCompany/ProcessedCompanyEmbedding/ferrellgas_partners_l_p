sold gas heaters and floor furnaces from its storefront on commercial street in downtown atchison in  ac ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in east atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers acs wife mabel was active in the family business serving as office manager and bookkeeper the business began a slow steady decline when mabel died in  the business continued on with ac electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions a massive flood in atchison in  destroyed much of the companys merchandise prompting ac to move the business from commercial street to rented space across the river in missouri ac and mabels oldest son and middle child current company chairman james ferrell enrolled in the university of kansas in  that same year he married a yearold freshman from nearby benedictine college named elizabeth zibbie james ferrell graduated from college in  with a business degree as an undergraduate he participated in rotc enjoying the discipline and the regimen while learning the principles of leadership that would aid him throughout his career as an entrepreneur and international businessman after graduation he went to fort benning georgia to attend infantry school after being stationed for a year in korea james and zibbie ferrell moved to fort lewis washington it was there that james received a letter from ac ferrell asking if he could

of buckeye gas products company makes ferrellgas a nationwide companyedit ferrellgas wasnt the only propane company in the nations heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late s and early s another such propane retailer was buckeye gas products company buckeye traced its roots to  when standard oil company formed the buckeye pipeline co to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately a wall street banker james ferrell met in the early s who would later become a member of the ferrellgas board of directors andy levison contacted james ferrell in  to let him know that buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated  million and asked if he wanted to bid on it the purchase would elevate ferrellgas from a regional company to the countrys third largest retail propane marketer the initial public offeringedit with the acquisition of buckeye safely under its belt ferrellgas spent the late s and early s consolidating its operations and expanding into new geographical territory the november   acquisition of dupane gas service operations in rhode island was especially exciting dupane gas served  rhode island customers with  million gallons of propane a year it gave ferrellgas its first entry into the competitive and potentially lucrative northeast market ferrellgas continued its acquisition efforts in  and  in the latter year the company closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major acquisitions in new jersey and rhode island the need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave james ferrell the idea to form a master limited partnership mlp in june  ferrellgas issued partnership units of ferrellgas partners lp on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol fgp employee stock ownership plan esop formededit in  investment bank goldman sachs brought james ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement the idea was for ferrell to sell his interest in ferrellgas to the companys employees in a leveraged employee stock ownership plan or esop the plans which were supported by the clinton administration helped provide tax incentives for the transfer of ownership to a broad base of employees on july   thousands of ferrellgas employees gathered in  meetings across the united states to learn they had become owners of the company through the establishment of the esop ferrell appeared in a videotaped presentation

overland park kansas purchase of buckeye gas products company makes ferrellgas a nationwide companyedit ferrellgas wasnt the only propane company in the nations heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late s and early s another such propane retailer was buckeye gas products company buckeye traced its roots to  when standard oil company formed the buckeye pipeline co to move petroleum products to refineries in northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately a wall street banker james ferrell met in the early s who would later become a member of the ferrellgas board of directors andy levison contacted james ferrell in  to let him know that buckeye’s propane subsidiary was for sale at an estimated  million and asked if he wanted to bid on it the purchase would elevate ferrellgas from a regional company to the countrys third largest

closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major acquisitions in new jersey and rhode island the need to access capital for acquisitions and internal growth gave james ferrell the idea to form a master limited partnership mlp in june  ferrellgas issued partnership units of ferrellgas partners lp on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol fgp employee stock ownership plan esop formededit in  investment bank goldman sachs brought james ferrell an idea that would help him transition into retirement the idea was for ferrell to sell his interest in ferrellgas to the companys

or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive

the propane leader has struggled mightily in the last year is it a buying opportunity maxx chatsko tmfblackngold jul   at am if you used a blue rhino propane tank to fuel the grill at your fourth of july cookout then you were using a branded product from ferrellgas partners lp nysefgp despite the regional name recognition for several of its brands the dividend stock is trading at alltime lows thats quite a statement considering the company has been publicly traded since  the main reason for the companys stunning drop in the past  months is simple the partnership cut its distribution payout by  it was the right thing to do but theres still a long road ahead before the company gets back on the right track that puts investors in an awkward position given everything that has happened and looking ahead is ferrellgas partners lp stock a buy image source getty images the business last november ferrellgas partners announced that it would be cutting its distribution payments from  per share to just  per share thats because the companys debt grew  from fiscal yea  to the fiscal year  thanks to a mostly botched expansion into midstream operations revenue has only increased  in the same period therefore it needs to free up operating cash flow to begin getting a handle on its deteriorating balance sheet and it can only do that by drastically reducing its distribution whether or not the move pays off in a reasonable amount of time depends on the health of the business the company reports three segments the core focus is and always has been propane and gas liquid sales which comprised  of total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal year  the second largest segment is midstream operations which has actually catalyzed the companys precipitous fall in the last year the company tidies up smaller businesses and other loose ends in a segment called other heres how they stack up through the first nine months of fiscal year  which concluded at the end of april metric first nine months fiscal  first nine months fiscal  percent change propane and gas liquids revenue  billion  million  midstream operations revenue  million  million  other revenue  million  million  propane and gas liquids gross profit  million  million  midstream operations gross profit  million  million  other gross profit  million  million  source sec filings aside from an uptick in propane and gas liquids sales investors witnessed a decline in revenue and gross profit from every other part of the business during the comparison period however the most important aspects of the business  and its ability to pay down its debt  are earnings and operating cash flow investors have mixed results to digest for instance eps during the first nine months of fiscal year  registered at  although that includes multiple quarters of getting the house in order during the most recent quarter the company reported eps of  which isnt close to historical levels but is better than reporting a net loss fgp data by ycharts then again ferrellgas partners reported cash from operating activities of  million during the same ninemonth period thats well below the  million posted in the yearago period although once again the most recent quarter carried most of the progress  million of that total was generated in the most recent three month period  is the stock a buy while i can see that this is a great opportunity to apply the be greedy when others are fearful investing adage im not convinced that ferrellgas partners is a buy it still needs to prove it can generate enough cash from operations to begin paying down its hefty debt pile and do so consistently  meaning for several consecutive quarters and thats the problem all three business segments are sliding at exactly the wrong time so even though there may be opportunity to buy the stock at an alltime low its probably too risky for most investors maxx chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position

of buckeye gas products company makes ferrellgas a nationwide companyedit ferrellgas wasnt the only propane company in the nations heartland that was expanding rapidly in the late s and early s

northwestern ohio by the s the company was supplying refineries from chicago to buffalo and following world war ii it expanded its pipeline network into new york new jersey and pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter

million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its penetration into the northeast with major

pennsylvania in  the pennsylvania railroad acquired buckeye since most of its pipelines paralleled the railroad’s rightofway across the midatlantic states the pennsylvania railroad merged with the new york central railroad in  when the nation’s freight and passenger railroad network was struggling to survive three years later in  the merged penn central railroad filed for the thenlargest corporate bankruptcy in american history buckeye meanwhile remained one of the bankrupt railroad’s more profitable subsidiaries in the s the company made a sizable investment in infrastructure and in  buckeye expanded into new england with the acquisition of the pipeline company jet lines inc in  penn central created a master limited partnership to spin off buckeye and hired goldman sachs  co to act as lead underwriter the planned offering did not go well and goldman advised management that the placement would go better if buckeye was split into its pipeline and propane components and sold separately a wall street banker james ferrell met in the early s who would later become a member of the ferrellgas board of directors andy levison contacted james ferrell in  to let him know that

closed  acquisitions ranging from the  million gallons sold by united cities propane gas in georgia to the  gallons retailed by fessler mill  hardware in wisconsin the company continued its

propane tank to fuel the grill at your fourth of july cookout then you were using a branded product from ferrellgas partners lp nysefgp despite the regional name recognition for several of its brands the dividend stock is trading at alltime lows thats quite a statement considering the company has been publicly traded since  the main reason for the companys stunning drop in the past  months is simple the partnership cut its distribution payout by  it was the right thing to do but theres still a long road ahead before the company gets back on the right track that puts investors in an awkward position given everything that has happened and looking ahead is ferrellgas partners lp stock a buy image source getty images the business last november ferrellgas partners announced that it would be cutting its distribution payments from  per share to just  per share thats because the companys debt grew  from fiscal yea  to the fiscal year  thanks to a mostly botched expansion into midstream operations revenue has only increased  in the same period therefore it needs to free up operating cash flow to begin getting a handle on its deteriorating balance sheet and it can only do that by drastically reducing its distribution whether or not the move pays off in a reasonable amount of time depends on the health of the business the company reports three segments the core focus is and always has been propane and gas liquid sales which comprised  of total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal year  the second largest segment is midstream operations which has actually catalyzed the companys precipitous fall in the last year the company tidies up smaller businesses and other loose ends in a segment called other heres how they stack up through the first nine months of fiscal year  which concluded at the end of april metric first nine months fiscal  first nine months fiscal  percent change propane and gas liquids revenue  billion  million  midstream operations revenue  million  million  other revenue  million  million  propane and gas liquids gross profit  million  million  midstream operations gross profit  million  million  other gross profit  million  million  source sec filings aside from an uptick in propane and gas liquids sales investors witnessed a decline in revenue and gross profit from every other part of the business during the comparison period however the most important aspects of the business  and its ability to pay down its debt  are earnings and operating cash flow investors have mixed results to digest for instance eps during the first nine months of fiscal year  registered at  although that includes multiple quarters of getting the house in order during the most recent quarter the company reported eps of  which isnt close to historical levels but is better than reporting a net loss fgp data by ycharts then again ferrellgas partners reported cash from operating activities of  million during the same ninemonth period thats well below the  million posted in the yearago period although once again the most recent quarter carried most of the progress  million of that total was generated in the most recent three month period  is the stock a buy while i can see that this is a great opportunity to apply the be greedy when others are fearful investing adage im not convinced that ferrellgas partners is a buy it still needs to prove it can generate enough cash from operations to begin paying down its hefty debt pile and do so consistently  meaning for several consecutive quarters and thats the problem all three business segments are sliding at exactly the wrong time so even though there may be opportunity to buy the stock at an alltime low its probably too risky for most investors maxx chatsko has no

the propane business has been tough lately which is why the steady performer wins over the fixerupper in this pairing reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer jun   at am amerigas partners lp nyseapu summed up the problem facing the propane distribution industry when it announced fiscal secondquarter earnings it was the warmest second quarter on record in fact its been relatively mild the last few years depressing demand and clouding the outlook for propane ferrellgas partners lp nysefgp is facing the same demon but its also dealing with two more of its making heres why amerigas is the better option for most investors that was a mistake in mid ferrellgas began building an oil and gas midstream business with the acquisition of sable environmental over the next couple of years it added to that division through additional acquisitions however when it lost a key customer the midstream investment quickly turned into a liability the distribution was slashed a painful  at the end of  the board dismissed the ceo who orchestrated the midstream investment and the former ceo company founder james ferrell was brought back to right the ship   image source amerigas partners lp there are two main problems faced by the company today the first is an underperforming midstream business around  of revenues in the fiscal second quarter although propane tends to be a relatively stable operation ferrellgas needs to fix the problems in midstream or jettison those assets neither is likely to be easy to do   the second problem is related to the first ferrellgas has too much debt thats why the partnership cut the distribution  so it could push more cash toward the debt overhang crucial as the companys midstream purchases increased debt by roughly  between  and    so ferrellgas has a troubled business and too much debt it knows about these problems and is working to fix them i believe it will be able to do so making it an interesting turnaround play however if youre only looking for propane exposure its a highrisk way to get it because of these selfimposed problems  rolling along warm weather led to a  decline in propane gallons sold at amerigas partners in the fiscal second quarter warm weather and weak volumes have been a trend for a couple of years now its a headwind every propane company has faced but its important to point out that its the only significant headwind amerigas is dealing with right now    in fact amerigas just increased its distribution for the th consecutive year it was a modest  hike but it was the thought that counted effectively management was saying that distribution increases are significant even when the partnership is facing nearterm adversity     to be fair longterm debt is a substantial  of the capital structure but thats a lot better than ferrellgas capital structure longterm debt is over  of its capital structure because midstream asset writedowns pushed unitholder equity into negative territory amerigas has also been pushing out its debt maturities giving it added breathing room for an improvement in the weather at this point it doesnt have any significant maturities until  along the way it also managed to lower its average interest rate a double win   amerigas has pushed out its debt and lowered its average interest rate image source amerigas partners lp meanwhile amerigas continues to acquire new propane businesses to expand its industry footprint note that it is already the largest propane distributor with a  market share so its rolling with the punches on the weather so it will be in a better industry position when things get chilly again   to be honest the mild weather stress that propane companies are facing is theoretically a great opportunity for amerigas since it increases the likelihood of momandpop competitors selling out while ferrellgas is continuing to expand too amerigas is doing so from a much stronger financial position   its also worthwhile to note that amerigas is a part of the ugi nyseugi family that diversified natural gas and propane company is amerigas general partner and owns roughly  of the partnerships units so unlike ferrellgas amerigas has a strong parent backing its business and growth   one problem or three both amerigas and ferrellgas are dealing with warm weather however ferrellgas is also dealing with too much debt and a troubled midstream business its a turnaround play that might interest more aggressive investors but if thats not your thing  and it shouldnt be for most investors  then amerigas is clearly the better option here weather is an issue but amerigas appears to be handling it with relative ease and youll get a nice  distribution yield while you wait for colder weather to arrive reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the
