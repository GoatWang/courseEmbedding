company we our and us is the largest independent producer of highquality coke in the americas as measured by tons of coke produced each year and has more than  years of coke production experience coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process coke is generally produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven which releases certain volatile components from the coal thus transforming the coal into coke we have designed developed built own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the united states us which consist of our haverhill coke company llc haverhill middletown coke company llc middletown gateway energy and coke company llc granite city jewell coke company lp jewell and indiana harbor coke company indiana harbor cokemaking facilities these five cokemaking facilities have collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately  million tons of coke per year additionally we have designed and operate one cokemaking facility in brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of our customers all of our us coke sales are made pursuant to longterm takeorpay agreements these coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately seven years and contain passthrough provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process including coal costs subject to meeting contractual coaltocoke yields operating and

sales agreement with ak steel holding corporation ak steel at our haverhill facility are subject to early termination by ak steel under limited circumstances and provided that ak steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreements and certain other conditions are met no other coke sales contract has an early termination clause our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities we direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces while our steelmaking customers are operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity our customers have continued to see increases in steel pricing and positive signals on trade and infrastructure during the first half of  despite the improved market trends over the last year ak steel and united states steel corporation us steel

river terminal llc drt which is located in virginia adjacent to our jewell cokemaking facility and was formed to accommodate jewell in its direct procurement of thirdparty coal beginning in  coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways including rail truck barge or ship the partnerships coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading storage and mixing services the partnership does not take possession of coal in its coal logistics business but instead earns revenue by providing coal handling andor mixing services to its customers on a fee per ton basis mixing andor handling services are provided to steel coke including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities electric utility and coal producing customers table of contents the financial performance of the partnerships coal logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers the partnerships cmt customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest europe as referenced in the argusmccloskeys coal price index report api index price contribute to the partnerships customers decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through the partnerships terminal facility the partnerships krt terminals are primarily impacted by the domestic coal markets in which its customers operate and generally benefit from extreme weather conditions in april  the company announced the termination of discussions with the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the partnership regarding our proposal to acquire all of the partnerships common units not already owned by the company simplification transaction announced on october   the conflicts committee and its independent advisors reviewed the proposal made by the company and had several discussions with the company regarding the potential transaction

million irs final regulations on qualifying income in january  the internal revenue service irs announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations the final regulations issued under section de of the internal revenue code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships however the final regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the final regulations the partnership previously received a willlevel opinion from its counsel vinson  elkins llp that the partnerships cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the final regulations therefore the partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period cokemaking entities in the partnership will become taxable as corporations on january   after the transition period ends as a result of the final regulations the partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of  million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of  primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets which are expected to exist at the end of the year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable as the company consolidates the partnership the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of  however the company had already recorded  million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the companys share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the partnership therefore the net impact to the companys deferred tax expense was

franklin furnace ohio announced the us environmental protection agency and the justice department   settlement resources search archives for this news release release date    suncoke energy inc and two of its subsidiaries have agreed to pay  million to resolve alleged clean air act violations consent decree on this page overview of company violations injunctive relief pollutant reductions health and environmental benefits supplemental environmental projects civil penalty comment period contact overview of company suncoke energy inc suncoke and haverhill north coke co haverhill own and operate the facility located in franklin furnace ohio suncoke and gateway energy  coke co gateway own and operate the facility located in granite city illinois suncoke haverhill and gateway are incorporated in the state of delaware suncoke is also an owner of three other nonrecovery coking plants in the united states  suncoke and its partners are the only companies using the nonrecovery coking method in the united states the coke making process involves carbonization of coal at high temperatures to concentrate the carbon commercial coke is generally made in one of two ways  byproduct coking and  nonrecoveryheat recovery coking a majority of the coke produced in the united states comes from byproduct coking where the coal is carbonized in large ovens and the offgas is collected and processed to recover various carbonbased byproducts such as napthalene benzene toluene and xylene  in facilities using the nonrecovery coking process the ovens are heated differently such that no external heat source is required the volatile products from the coal are combusted with oxygen in the chamber providing heat from above and gas flues in the bottom of the chamber collect the combustion gases and provide heat from below the typical carbonbased pollutants from carbonizing the coal in the byproduct coking process eg benzene are not present in the gas stream exiting the coke ovens because they are collected recirculated to the oven and combusted to provide heat because there are no coking byproducts to recover the process is called nonrecovery coking process the gas stream from the nonrecovery coking process is vented through a stack to create a natural draft for the negativepressure process these gases cannot be sent directly to pollution control equipment because of the high temperatures the gases are however sent to a waste heat recovery boiler where cooling takes place such that the gases can then continue to pollution control equipment such as flue gas desulfurization for sulfur control and bag houses for particulate control the nonrecovery coking process offers advantages over the byproduct coking process in that it reduces the coking cycle and results in better quality coke if operated correctly   top of page violations the majority of the violations at issue in this case resulted from chronic excessive bypassing of the heat recovery steam generators hrsgs and emission control equipment during malfunctions maintenance or other operational problems both facilities’ permits contain a limited number of allowable bypass hours for each bypass stack eg  hrsyrstack along with hourly and yearly emission limits for so nox co pm and lead in addition the illinois permit contains emission limits for sulfuric acid and volatile organic compounds while the ohio permit contains emission limits for mercury and hydrochloric acid both the illinois and ohio facilities exceeded permit limits for hours of bypass and for the corresponding emissions of so pm and lead top of page injunctive relief under the proposed settlement the companies will install redundant hrsgs at the two facilities that will minimize the need to vent directly to the atmosphere when a problem occurs or maintenance is needed at a primary hrsg the companies estimate that the design and installation of the redundant hrsgs will cost approximately  million the companies are required to amend their permits to reflect the reduced bypass hours and emissions in addition the companies must minimize emissions for all anticipated bypass vents by reducing the coal charge and sulfur content  the companies must also conduct a root cause analysis for all bypass venting lasting longer than a total of thirty minutes in a  hour period in order to ensure that bypass venting is limited to either planned maintenance or malfunctions bypass venting not associated with these causes may be subject to stipulated penalties if not in accordance with good engineering pollution control practices  finally the companies will install monitoring equipment at each facility to continuously monitor sulfur dioxide emissions from certain bypass vents at an estimated cost of  top of page pollutant reductions when fully implemented epa estimates that the actions required by the proposed consent decree will reduce emissions of so by approximately  tpy pm by  tpy and lead by  lbsyr  other estimated emission reductions stemming from the injunctive relief embodied in the proposed consent decree include mercury  lbsyr hydrochloric acid  tpy sulfuric acid  tpy vocs  tpy nitrogen oxides  tpy and carbon monoxide  tpy  furthermore the installation of redundant hrsgs is reasonably expected to have a collateral impact on total greenhouse gases because both facilities sell electricity to the local grids currently when bypassing occurs the energy in the gas is wasted arguably other fossil fuel burning facilities will likely have to compensate for energy loss resulting in greater greenhouse gases to the atmosphere  top of page health and environmental benefits health and environmental impacts from the pollutants addressed in this settlement include the following particulate matter – particulate matter has been linked to a range of serious respiratory and cardiovascular health problems the key effects associated with exposure to ambient particulate matter include premature mortality aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease aggravated asthma acute respiratory symptoms chronic bronchitis decreased lung function and increased risk of myocardial infarction recent epidemiologic studies estimate that exposures to particulate matter may result in tens of thousands of excess deaths per year and many more cases of illness nation wide sulfur dioxide – sulfur dioxides can be converted to fine particulate matter once in the air high concentrations of so affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease sensitive populations include asthmatics individuals with bronchitis or emphysema children and the elderly sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition or acid rain lead  the effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through breathing or swallowing lead can affect almost every organ and system in the body the nervous system is the main target for lead toxicity both in adults and children longterm exposure of adults can result weakness in extremities lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure particularly in middleaged and older people exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death in pregnant women high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage high level exposure in men can damage reproductive organs top of page supplemental environmental projects the proposed settlement includes a lead abatement project at residential facilities surrounding the gateway facility to reduce lead hazards in owneroccupied lowincome residences with priority given to families with young children or pregnant women the companies must complete the lead abatement project within two years of the effective date of the proposed consent decree  top of page civil penalty the companies have agreed to pay  million to resolve the claims in the complaint the united states will receive a cash payment of  million illinois will receive a cash payment of  ohio will receive a cash payment of  under the settlement the companies must also spend at least  on a
