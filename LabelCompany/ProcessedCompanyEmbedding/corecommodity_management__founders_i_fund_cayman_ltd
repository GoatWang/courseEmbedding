larger losses or smaller gains than otherwise would be the case if the fund invested directly in the underlying securities a highly liquid secondary market may not exist for certain commoditylinked derivatives and there can be no assurance that one will develop certain derivative transactions may give rise to a form of leverage leverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss

with the funds direct and indirect investments in commoditylinked derivatives the fund will attempt to manage its counterparty exposure so as to limit its exposure to any one counterparty however due to the limited number of entities that may serve as counterparties and which the fund believes are creditworthy at any one time the fund may enter into commoditylinked derivative transactions with a limited number of counterparties or issued by a limited number of issuers that will act as counterparties which may increase the funds exposure to counterparty credit risk diversification does not
