things to me and answers my questions well from time to time he may run behind but i can assure you he will spend time with you when its your turn he doesnt appear to play catchup i like the fact that our records are digital and can sometimes be accessed by other facilities depending on whether or not the other facility has set up similar system he is very approachable i feel like i can tell him akaren in key west fl  jul  having several medical issues i am very thankful to have dr norris as my doctor he is kind attentiveand thorough with exams and explanations the office is professional and knowledgable aj in key west fl  jun  i moved to key west a year ago this monthi searched high and low for a doctor that accepted my insurance and that provided the level of care i have come to expect i visited  other doctors offices prior to this one and his office by far exceeds my other experiences zuki at the front desk is amazing and tonya is always pleasant  i joke with dr norris that i would take his team as i know how hard it is to find help on this island bottom line  combo of staff and dr interactions are awesometracey sexton in key west fl  may  i am a long time patient and am always pleased with the level of care and concern shown by dr norris he is genuine respectful listens and takes time to develop a relationship with me as a patient i am however considering looking for a new physician because of his staff the nurse tanya is extremely unprofessional and blatantly rude and the office manager clearly does not seem to care it is clear that neither has manners customer service training or showed any signs of care or concern key west fl  feb  the physician was caring and thorough the staff was uncaring unfriendly uninformed and unprofessional the strange behaviors include failure to return calls or give test results when you do finally get to speak with staff they seem quite bothered and annoyed its embarrassing for the patient they need customer service traininghave
