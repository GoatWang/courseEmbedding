menu about us about us team qsim technology video technology products news contact about us team qsim technology video technology products news contact technology making better lives for today  tomorrow the haberbosch process getting technical today almost all ammonia nh is produced through the yearold haberbosch process the haberbosch process involves a chemical reaction between hydrogen h and nitrogen n in order to turn these elements into ammonia nh the strong triple bond in the nitrogen molecule and the single bond in the hydrogen molecule must both be broken breaking those bonds requires a tremendous amount of energy to reduce the amount of energy required and to improve efficiencies a catalyst is introduced a catalyst is a material that helps speed up chemical reactions catalytic activity happens on the surface the greater the surface area of the catalyst the more efficient or faster the chemical reaction a fast chemical reaction means lower costs and energy required to produce the reaction therefore the goal is to have a catalyst with a large surface area in the manufacture of ammonia iron is the catalyst of choice when the iron catalyst is introduced into the ammonia manufacturing process the nitrogen molecule interacts so strongly with the electrons on the surface of the iron catalyst that the bond between the two atoms in the nitrogen molecule is weakened and eventually breaks this leaves both nitrogen atoms with three free electrons enabling each atom to bond to three hydrogen atoms at the end of the reaction chain this combination forms ammonia since more than  of the ammonia produced annually is used as agricultural fertilizer to significantly improve crop yield and ammonia fertilizer is responsible for feeding  of the world’s population the haberbosch process has often been called the most important invention of the th century eg v smil nature    ammonia synthesis white paper chemical engineering january  boosting catalyst productivity nature geoscience october  how a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world view ammonia video below understanding nano materials a nanometer nm is one billionth of a meter or  times smaller than the diameter of a human hair simply put nanotechnology involves the production and use of materials and devices with molecularscale precision it requires the control of matter at dimensions of roughly  nm these tiny particles can be seen only with the most powerful electron microscopes the unique physical chemical and biological properties of nano materials differ fundamentally from the properties of larger particles as size decreases there is a corresponding increase in surface area and surface energy nanotechnology focuses on understanding and creating improved materials devices and systems to exploit these novel properties using nanotechnology to improve the haberbosch process at qsi we’ve leveraged our unique understanding of nanotechnology to develop nanoscale catalysts that accelerate industrial chemical reactions these are called “nanocatalyst accelerators” qsi’s nanocatalyst accelerators are applied as a coating to standard catalysts and improve a catalyst’s efficiency by up to  by increasing the surface area of the catalyst think of it this way a basketball representing the standard iron catalyst has a certain surface area if you cover that basketball with mini basketballs the size of bbs representing the iron nanocatalyst you now have the surface area of the basketball plus the surface area of thousands of mini basketballs the total surface area has increased significantly qsi’s fenix™ iron nanocatalyst accelerators typically measure in the  nm range they make the haberbosch process more efficient by increasing the active surface area of standard commercial iron catalysts thereby lowering the reaction temperature and pressure required for the haberbosch process to occur as a result less energy is needed to complete the reaction and create ammonia the nanocatalysts that we create through our patented process offer superior properties including a spherical shape a controlled oxide layer a crystalline structure very large surface area and consistent particle size these nanocatalysts yield consistently higher reaction activity and greater efficiency intellectual property the patent for quantumsphere’s gas phase condensation gpc process which is the key to our nanocatalyst production was awarded october   its broad claims on the gpc process allow us to produce high surface area catalysts at the nano scale to date we have  issued patents and  patent pending we have expended a substantive amount of capital and effort in establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio and we will continue to file additional patents where appropriate an automated process quantumsphere’s patented process is safe environmentally friendly and fully automated unlike competitive processes we’ve removed expensive labor and the potential for human error from the manufacturing equation additionally qsi’s implementation process onsite at industrial chemical facilities requires low supervision and little downtime with full automation comes increased production rates and lower labor and conversion costs our ability to deliver highquality nanoscale catalysts in commercial quantities at reasonable prices has enabled industryleading companies to incorporate our advanced technology into many industrial and consumer products together with our partners we are making possible the accelerated commercialization and mass market penetration of these new advanced materials competing technologies synthetic or manmade nanoscale materials were first created in the s using the gpc method today there are dozens of processes for producing nanoscale materials most of these processes are very expensive require sophisticated and complex equipment and are labor intensive in addition these methods may result in products with inconsistent particle size distribution shape and impurities with little ability to scale up to commercial volume at reasonable cost to qsi management’s knowledge no other company can match the size purity uniformity and catalytic activity of qsi products they cannot deliver in large volumes and they cannot demonstrate meaningful
