biodegradable and provides easy cleanup and lessens cat tracking summary of the invention  therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is nontoxic and naturally safe  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is biodegradable  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is odoreliminating  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is scented  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter having antimicrobial agents  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that clumps in a convenient size for easy disposal and which has little dust and reduces tracking by cats  it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter which includes manufacture from modified corn starch  briefly described according to one embodiment of the present invention an improved cat litter is provided and includes manufacture from modified corn starch yucca schidigera antimicrobial agents antiodor agents zeolite distilled dried grains and sodium bicarbonate for improving the litter density and for improving cost production  modified corn starch is a polysaccharide which are the most common agents used in providing the cohesiveness or clumping of litter when used among the suitable agents that may additionally be used for clumping are dextrins maltodetrins flours cellulosics hemicellulosics and the many varieties of starches  yucca schidigera is a plant typically found in the desert regions of arizona california nevada utah and mexico among its many properties the yucca schidigeras ability to bind and neutralize ammonia is relevant to the cat litter formula natural saponins which are emulsifying or foaming agents are found in the leaves of the yucca schidigera and are the chemicals responsible for binding and neutralizing the annoying and harmful odors associated with the ammonia formed in the litter after the breakdown of urea which is found in cat urine the natural saponins may also act to neutralize the odors associated with cat feces as yucca scutigera is also used in animal foods to help neutralize feces odor within the intestinal tract of an animal so that when the feces are passed the odor is less objectionable in addition to the natural saponins from yucca scutigera additional antiodor agents may be added to further curb the smell generated from waste deposited in the cat litter  antimicrobial agents are also added to help curb the initiation and development of microbes that may be harmful to cat and cat owner such as molds the antimicrobial agents may come from among sodium propionate calcium propionate or other known chemicals in addition to the agents suggested additional antimicrobial compounds may be included with those already suggested so as to provide maximum protection against the formation of microbes bacteria or molds  the general method of manufacture of the cat litter formula is comprised of a mash distillation process and an extrusion technology processdetailed description of the preferred embodiment a composition  an improved cat litter is provided according to the present invention comprised of a composition which includes the following ingredients polysaccharide modified corn starch zeolite yucca schidegira distillers dried grains salt compound sodium bicarbonate and antimicrobial agents the distillers dried grains utilized in the improved cat litter is manufactured via a mash distillation process to be described in greater detail below  each of the aforementioned ingredients may have one or more subcomponents for example the salt compound is preferably sodium bicarbonate however potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate are envisioned as being selected alone or in combination  yucca schidegira as a natural saponin is an emulsifying or foaming agent which functions to inhibit urease enzyme action and to prevent the formation of nh ammonia thereby binding and neutralizing annoying and harmful odors associated therewith yucca schidegira further serves to help neutralize feces odor  the antimicrobial agents preferably including sodium propionate and calcium propionate facilitate protection against the formation of microbes bacteria or molds  zeolite is a natural mineral consisting of silica and alumina zeolite has a unique interconnecting lattice structure arranged to form a honeycomb framework of consistent diameter interconnecting channels and pores negativelycharged alumina building blocks and neutrallycharged silica building blocks are stacked thereby producing an open three dimensional honeycomb framework odors and gases such as ammonia are attracted to and trapped within the zeolite crystalline structure zeolite also adsorbs and desorbs water thus eliminating and preventing mildew formation  modified corn starch is a polysaccharide which serves in the production of alcohol and provides cohesiveness or clumping of litter while other cereal grains such as wheat barley and rye may be selected modified corn starch is preferred in addition other suitable agents facilitating occlusivity or clumping may include a mixture of detrins maltodetrins flours and arabinoxylans b method of manufacture  in practicing the present invention the general method of manufacture is comprised of a mash distillation process which includes grinding corn into a coarse modified flour called meal the meal is mixed with water and a malt enzyme preferably alphaamylase and is passed through cookers where starch is liquefied heat is applied to enable liquefaction using cookers with a high temperature stage and a lower temperature holding period wherein a mash product is produced the high temperature stage facilitates reduced bacteria levels in the mash product the mash product is then cooled and an additional malt enzyme is added to convert liquefied starch to fermentable sugars the additional malt enzyme selected includes gluc amylase and betaamylase however gluc amylase is preferred yeast preferably saccharomyces cerevisiae is then added in order to ferment the sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide saccharomyces cerevisiae is the preferred yeast species because it facilitates quick efficient production of alcohol and possesses a high alcoholic concentration tolerance fermented mash results and is sent to distillation wherein ethanol is extracted leaving spent mash the spent mash is centrifuged where liquid is separated therefrom the liquid or stillage is reintroduced into the cooking system and sold as livestock feed or is partially dehydrated into a syrup the aforementioned mash distillation process is executed under controlled ph being adjusted and readjusted in a suitable manner as is commonly practiced in such industry  the mash distillation process creates two main coproducts in the production of ethanol namely carbon dioxide and distillers grains the distillers grains are rich in protein fat minerals vitamins and amino acids and thus serve as a highly valued livestock feed ingredient  next centrifuged spent mash distillers dried grains is suitably dried into a powder to which the following ingredients are added to form a litter product modified corn starch zeolite yucca schidegira sodium bicarbonate and antimicrobial agents the litter product is suitably dried to a powder and is processed through a pelletizer via an extrusion technology process so as to form particles each having a size approximating the size of a grain of wheat the particles are then bagged and sealed c example  the following example represents the general formulation for the improved cat litter of the present invention ingredientscomposition by weightpolysaccharide  preferably modified corn starchzeolite  preferably yucca schidegira  preferably distillers dried grains preferably sodium bicarbonate  preferably antimicrobial agents preferably  d operation of the preferred embodiment  to use the present invention user simply opens the improved cat litter from its sealed packaging and pours a suitable volume thereof within a container fabricated of a material specifically adapted for use as an animal litter storage receptacle  therefore the foregoing
