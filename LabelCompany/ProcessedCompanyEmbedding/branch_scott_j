directors including lost cocreator j j abrams buffy the vampire slayer creator joss whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers jon favreau harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan

mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip

with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of

harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinsongould before landing the role of meredith palmer baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february  nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular four of the shows writers have also performed in front of the camera b j novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his standup act paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novaks suggestion after his cold readings of scripts greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling onscreen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode diversity day where michael needed to be slapped by a minority since that slap ive been on the show as kelly kapoor says kaling michael schur has also made occasional appearances as dwights cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip by using mambo no  and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as it already appeared in the episode charactersedit main article list of the office us tv series characters see also list of the office us tv series cast members further information the office

for pam many products featured are not part of product placement agreements but rather inserted by writers as products the characters would use to create realism under the guise of a documentary chilis restaurants were used for filming in the dundies and the client as the writers believed they were realistic choices for a company party and business lunch though not an explicit product placement the producers of the show had to allow chilis to have final approval of the script before filming causing a scene of the dundies to be hastily rewritten when the chain objected to the original version apple inc received over four minutes of publicity for the ipod when it was used as a muchdesired gift in christmas party though the company did not pay for the placement the travel website tripadvisorcom was featured during season  when after a visit to dwights agritourism bed and breakfast schrute farms jim and pam post an online review about their stay the show reportedly approached the travel review website about using their name on the show and tripadvisor set up a review page for the fictional bb which itself received hundreds of reviews the appearance of second life in the episode local ad was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of  receptionedit critical reviews and commentaryedit before the show aired ricky gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of ign in june  the second season was better received james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions  with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant  the new boss is different from the old boss and thats fine by me he named it the second best tv show of  after battlestar galactica entertainment weekly writer mark harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating thanks to the fearless steve carell an everstronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible—it honors ricky gervais original and works on its own terms the av club reviewer nathan rabin expressed its views on the shows progression after a rocky start the office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of tvs funniest sharpest shows the casting of steve carell in the gervais role proved to be a masterstroke the american office is that rarest of anomalies a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity the series has been included on several top tv series lists the show placed  on entertainment weeklys new tv classics list times james poniewozik named it the second best tv series of  and the sixth best returning series of  out of ten tv series he also included it on his the  best tv shows of alltime list the show was also named the best show of  by buddytv while paste named it the sixth best sitcom of  in  the writers guild of america placed it at  on their list of  best written tv series the show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior john spector ceo of the conference board says that both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad dilbert creator scott adams also touts the similarities the lesson from the office and from dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it a laboraffiliated

american television he then left the position when he cocreated the comedy series parks and recreation with fellow office writer michael schur and divided his time between the two series paul lieberstein and jennifer celotta were named the series showrunners for the fifth season celotta left the series after the sixth season and lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons he left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential dwight schrute spinoff the farm which was eventually passed up by nbc daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season other executive producers include cast members b j novak and mindy kaling kaling novak daniels lieberstein and schur made up the original team of writers kaling novak and lieberstein also serve multiple roles on the series as they play regular characters on the show as well as write direct and produce episodes credited with twentyfour episodes kaling is the most prolific writer on the staff ricky gervais and stephen merchant who created the original british series are credited as executive producers and wrote the pilot and the thirdseason episode the convict merchant later directed the episode customer survey while gervais appeared in the episodes the seminar and search committee randall einhorn is the most frequent director of the series with  credited episodes the series has also had several guest directors including lost cocreator j j abrams buffy the vampire slayer creator joss whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers jon favreau harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinsongould before landing the role of meredith palmer baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february  nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular four of the shows writers have also performed in front of the camera b j novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his standup act paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novaks suggestion after his cold readings of scripts greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling onscreen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode diversity day where michael needed to be slapped by a minority since that slap ive been on the show as kelly kapoor says kaling michael schur has also made occasional appearances as dwights cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip by using mambo no  and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as

for pam many products featured are not part of product placement agreements but rather inserted by writers as products the characters would use to create realism under the guise of a documentary chilis restaurants were used for filming in the dundies and the client as the writers believed they were realistic choices for a company party and business lunch though not an explicit product placement the producers of the show had to allow chilis to have final approval of the script before filming causing a scene of the dundies to be hastily rewritten when the chain objected to the original version apple inc received over four minutes of publicity for the ipod when it was used as a muchdesired gift in christmas party though the company did not pay for the placement the travel

approached the travel review website about using their name on the show and tripadvisor set up a review page for the fictional bb which itself received hundreds of reviews the appearance of second life in the episode local ad was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of  receptionedit critical reviews and commentaryedit before the show aired ricky gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of ign in june  the second season was better received james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions  with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant  the new boss is different from the old boss and thats fine by me he named it the second best tv show of  after battlestar galactica entertainment weekly writer mark harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating thanks to the fearless steve carell an everstronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible—it honors ricky gervais original and works on its own terms the av club reviewer nathan rabin expressed its views on the shows progression after a rocky start the office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of tvs funniest sharpest shows the casting of steve carell in the gervais role proved to be a masterstroke the american office is that rarest of anomalies a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity the series has been included on several top tv series lists the show placed  on entertainment weeklys new tv classics list times james poniewozik named it the second best tv series of  and the sixth best returning series of  out of ten tv series he also included it on his the  best tv shows of alltime list the show was also named the best show of  by buddytv while paste named it the sixth best sitcom of  in  the writers guild of america placed it at  on their list of  best written tv series the show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior john spector ceo of the conference board says that both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad dilbert creator scott adams also touts the similarities the lesson from the office and from dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it a laboraffiliated group praised the episode boys and girls for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on american television metacritic a review aggregation website only graded the first third sixth and final seasons however it denoted that all four of them received generally favorable reviews from critics awarding a    and  score—out of —to each of them respectively it later named it the thirteenth most mentioned series on best of decade topten lists the office now is a pale listless shadow of what it used to be —alan sepinwall of hitfix in september  the last few seasons were criticized for a dip in quality the sixth season received criticisms for a lack of stakes for the characters other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the jim and pam romance the office cocreator ricky gervais wrote in his blog referring to search committee particularly warren buffetts guest appearance if youre going to jump a shark jump a big one and compared the episode to the chris martin episode of gervaiss other series extras although he later said on his website i fucking didnt diss the office thats for sure some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of steve carell rainn wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes creatively such as the chemistry between spader and helms which he called a bit dark and argued that the show

american television he then left the position when he cocreated the comedy series parks and recreation with fellow office writer michael schur and divided his time between the two series paul lieberstein and jennifer celotta were named the series showrunners for the fifth season celotta left the series after the sixth season and lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons he left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential dwight schrute spinoff the farm which was eventually passed up by nbc daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season other executive producers include cast members b j novak and mindy kaling kaling novak daniels lieberstein and schur made up the original team of writers kaling novak and lieberstein also serve multiple roles on the series as they play regular characters on the show as well as write direct and produce episodes credited with twentyfour episodes kaling is the most prolific writer on the staff ricky gervais and stephen merchant who created the original british series are credited as executive producers and wrote the pilot and the thirdseason episode the convict

episodes the series has also had several guest directors including lost cocreator j j abrams buffy the vampire slayer creator joss whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers jon favreau harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinsongould before landing the role of meredith palmer baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february  nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular four of the shows writers have also performed in front of the camera b j novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his standup act paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novaks suggestion after his cold readings of scripts greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling onscreen in the series until the

also made occasional appearances as dwights cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip by using mambo no  and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as

that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of ign in june  the second season was better received james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions  with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant  the new boss is different from the

harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinsongould before landing the role of meredith palmer baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february  nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular four of the shows writers have also performed in front of the camera b j novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his standup act paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novaks suggestion after his cold readings of scripts greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling onscreen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode diversity day where michael needed to be slapped by a minority since that slap ive been on the show as kelly kapoor says kaling michael schur has also made occasional appearances as dwights cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip by using mambo no  and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as it already appeared in the episode charactersedit main article list of the office us tv series characters see also list of the office us tv series cast members further information the office

chilis restaurants were used for filming in the dundies and the client as the writers believed they were realistic choices for a company party and business lunch though not an explicit product placement the producers of the show had to allow chilis to have final approval of the script before filming causing a scene of the dundies to be hastily rewritten when the chain objected to the

life in the episode local ad was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of  receptionedit critical reviews and commentaryedit before the show aired ricky gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of ign in june  the second season was better received james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions  with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant  the new boss is different from the old boss and thats fine by me he named it the second best tv show of  after battlestar galactica entertainment weekly writer mark harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating thanks to the fearless steve carell an everstronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible—it honors ricky gervais original and works on its own terms the av club reviewer nathan rabin expressed its views on the shows progression after a rocky start the office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of tvs funniest sharpest shows the casting of steve carell in the gervais role proved to be a masterstroke the american office is that rarest of anomalies a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity the series has been included on several top tv series lists the show placed  on entertainment weeklys new tv classics list times james poniewozik named it the second best tv series of  and the sixth best returning series of  out of ten tv series he also included it on his the  best tv shows of alltime list the show was also named the best show of  by buddytv while paste named it the sixth best sitcom of  in  the writers guild of america placed it at  on their list of  best written tv series the show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior john spector ceo of the conference board says that both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad dilbert creator scott adams also touts the similarities the lesson from the office and from dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it a laboraffiliated group praised the episode boys and girls for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on american television metacritic a review aggregation website only graded the first third sixth and final seasons however it denoted that all four of them received generally favorable reviews from critics awarding a    and  score—out of —to each of them respectively it later named it the thirteenth most mentioned series on best of decade topten lists the office now is a pale listless shadow of what it used to be —alan sepinwall of hitfix in september  the last few seasons were criticized for a dip in quality the sixth season received criticisms for a lack of stakes for the characters other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the jim and pam romance the office cocreator ricky gervais wrote in his blog referring to search committee particularly warren buffetts guest appearance if youre going to jump a shark jump a big one and compared the episode to

jennifer celotta season – paul lieberstein season  greg daniels greg daniels served as the senior series showrunner for the first four seasons of the series and developed the british series for american television he then left the position when he cocreated the comedy series parks and recreation with fellow office writer michael schur and divided his time between the two series paul lieberstein and jennifer celotta were named the series showrunners for the fifth season celotta left the series after the sixth season and lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons he left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential dwight schrute spinoff the farm which was eventually passed up by nbc daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season other executive producers include cast members b j novak and mindy kaling kaling novak daniels lieberstein and schur made up the original team of writers kaling novak and lieberstein also serve multiple roles on the series as they play regular characters on the show as well as write direct and produce episodes credited with twentyfour episodes kaling is the most prolific writer on the staff ricky gervais and stephen merchant who created the original british series are credited as executive producers and wrote the pilot and the thirdseason episode the convict merchant later directed the episode customer survey while gervais appeared in the episodes the seminar and search committee randall einhorn is the most frequent director of the series with  credited episodes the series has also had several guest directors including lost cocreator j j abrams buffy the vampire slayer creator joss whedon both of whom are fans of the series and filmmakers jon favreau harold ramis jason reitman and marc webb episodes have been directed by several of the actors on the show including steve carell john krasinski rainn wilson ed helms and brian baumgartner development and writingedit before the series aired its second episode the writers spent time researching in offices this process was used for daniels other series king of the hill and parks and recreation the pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the british version daniels had decided to go this route because completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do due to the show being an adaptation he had briefly considered using the idea for the dundies as the pilot episode after the writers knew who the cast was they were allowed to write for the actors which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode diversity day following the mixed reaction towards the first season the writers attempted to make the series more optimistic and to make michael scott more likable they also established the supporting characters of the series more giving them actual personalities they also made the lights in the office brighter which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the british version a common problem with the scripts according to novak is that they tend to run too long for the regular minute time slot leading to several cuts for example the script for the episode search committee was initially  pages— pages too long a complete script is written for each episode however actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process fischer said our shows are  percent scripted they put everything down on paper but we get to play around a little bit too steve and rainn are brilliant improvisers this leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of the office all of which are considered part of the shows canon and storyline by daniels deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage in an experiment a deleted scene from the return was made available over nbccom and itunes explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information but eventually considered the experiment a failure castingedit according to jenna fischer the series used an unusual casting process which did not involve a script the producers would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for nbc programmer kevin reilly originally suggested paul giamatti to producer ben silverman for the role of michael scott but the actor declined martin short hank azaria and bob odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part in january  variety reported that steve carell of the popular comedy central program the daily show with jon stewart was in talks to play the role at the time he was already committed to another nbc midseason replacement comedy come to papa but the series was quickly canceled allowing his full commitment to the office carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the british series before he auditioned he did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying gervais characterizations other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included ben falcone alan tudyk jim zulevic and paul f tompkins rainn wilson was cast as powerhungry sycophant dwight schrute and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned wilson had originally auditioned for michael a performance that he described as a terrible ricky gervais impersonation however the casting directors liked his audition as dwight much more and hired him seth rogen matt besser patton oswalt and judah friedlander also auditioned for the role john krasinski left and jenna fischer right were virtually unknown before the series aired john krasinski and jenna fischer were virtually unknown before being cast in their respective roles as jim and pam the central love interests krasinski had attended school with b j novak and the two were friends fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible creating the original pam hairstyle in an interview on nprs fresh air fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for pam and jim with the producers partnering the different potential pams and jims four of each together to gauge their chemistry when fischer finished her scene with krasinski he told her that she was his favorite pam to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite jim adam scott and john cho both auditioned for the role of jim and kathryn hahn also auditioned for the role of pam the supporting cast includes actors known for their improv work angela kinsey kate flannery oscar nunez leslie david baker brian baumgartner melora hardin and david denman kinsey had originally auditioned for pam the producers thought she was too feisty for the character but they called her back for the part of angela martin which she won flannery first auditioned for the part of jan levinsongould before landing the role of meredith palmer baumgartner originally auditioned for stanley but was eventually cast as kevin ken kwapis the director of the pilot episode liked the way phyllis smith a casting associate read with other actors auditioning so much that he cast her as phyllis at the beginning of the third season ed helms and rashida jones joined the cast as members of dunder mifflin stamford while jones would later leave the cast for a role on parks and recreation in february  nbc announced that helms was being promoted to a series regular four of the shows writers have also performed in front of the camera b j novak was cast as reluctant temp ryan howard after daniels saw his standup act paul lieberstein was cast as human resources director toby flenderson on novaks suggestion after his cold readings of scripts greg daniels was originally unsure where to use mindy kaling onscreen in the series until the opportunity came in the script for the second episode diversity day where michael needed to be slapped by a minority since that slap ive been on the show as kelly kapoor says kaling michael schur has also made occasional appearances as dwights cousin mose and consulting producer larry wilmore has played diversity trainer mr brown plans were made for mackenzie crook martin freeman and lucy davis from the british version of the office to appear in the third season but those plans were scrapped due to scheduling conflicts filmingedit dunder mifflin company logo the office was filmed with a singlecamera setup in a cinéma vérité allowing the look of an actual documentary with no studio audience or laugh track allowing its deadpan and absurd humor to fully come across the primary vehicle for the show is that a camera crew has decided to film dunder mifflin and its employees seemingly around the clock the presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters especially michael scott who enthusiastically participates in the filming the characters especially jim and pam also look towards the camera when michael creates an awkward situation the main action of the show is supplemented with talkinghead interviews or confessionals in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the days events in order to get the feel of an actual documentary the producers hired cinematographer randall einhorn who is known for directing episodes of survivor which allowed the show to have the feel of rough and jumpy like an actual documentary according to producer michael schur the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly the producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format for example in the fourthseason episode did i stutter a scene featured michael going through a long process to go to the bathroom and not pass by stanley the producers debated whether that was possible and einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene despite the strict nature in the early years of the series later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not which also changed the writing and comedystyle of the series this inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans musicedit the office theme the song was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones problems playing this file see media help the theme song for the office was written by jay ferguson and performed by the scrantones it is played over the title sequence which features scenes of scranton various tasks around the office and often the main cast members some episodes of the series use a shortened version of the theme song starting with the fourth season the theme song is played over the closing credits which previously rolled in silence the exteriors of buildings in the title sequence are actual buildings in scranton pennsylvania and were shot by cast member john krasinski the mockumentary format of the show contains no laugh track and most of the music is diegetic with songs either sung or played by the characters or heard on radios computers or other devices however songs have been played during montages or the closing credits such as tiny dancer by elton john the dundies and islands in the stream by kenny rogers and dolly parton email surveillance featured music tends to be well known and often songs reflect the character such as michaels attempt to seem hip by using mambo no  and later my humps as his cell phone ringtone daniels has said that it does not count as film score as long as it already appeared in the episode charactersedit main article list of the office us tv series characters see also list of the office us tv series cast members further information the office

for pam many products featured are not part of product placement agreements but rather inserted by writers as products the characters would use to create realism under the guise of a documentary chilis restaurants were used for filming in the dundies and the client as the writers believed they were realistic choices for a company party and business lunch though not an explicit product placement the producers of the show had to allow chilis to have final approval of the script before filming causing a scene of the dundies to be hastily rewritten when the chain objected to the original version apple inc received over four minutes of publicity for the ipod when it was used as a muchdesired gift in christmas party though the company did not pay for the placement the travel website tripadvisorcom was featured during season  when after a visit to dwights agritourism bed and breakfast schrute farms jim and pam post an online review about their stay the show reportedly approached the travel review website about using their name on the show and tripadvisor set up a review page for the fictional bb which itself received hundreds of reviews the appearance of second life in the episode local ad was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of  receptionedit critical reviews and commentaryedit before the show aired ricky gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers the first season of the office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the shortlived nbc series coupling which was also based on a british version the new york daily news called it so diluted theres little left but muddy water and usa today called it a passable imitation of a milesbetter bbc original a guardian unlimited review panned its lack of originality stating steve carell just seems to be trying too hard  maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation tom shales of the washington post said it was not the mishmash that americanized version of coupling turned out to be but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim like when the copying machine is just about to give out the office has one of the best casts on television  it also has created several compelling characters and touching relationships all of which is fairly remarkable for a half hour comedy —travis fickett of ign in june  the second season was better received james poniewozik of time remarked producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions  with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant  the new boss is different from the old boss and thats fine by me he named it the second best tv show of  after battlestar galactica entertainment weekly writer mark harris echoed these sentiments a week later stating thanks to the fearless steve carell an everstronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible—it honors ricky gervais original and works on its own terms the av club reviewer nathan rabin expressed its views on the shows progression after a rocky start the office improved immeasurably instantly becoming one of tvs funniest sharpest shows the casting of steve carell in the gervais role proved to be a masterstroke the american office is that rarest of anomalies a remake of a classic show that both does right by its source and carves out its own strong identity the series has been included on several top tv series lists the show placed  on entertainment weeklys new tv classics list times james poniewozik named it the second best tv series of  and the sixth best returning series of  out of ten tv series he also included it on his the  best tv shows of alltime list the show was also named the best show of  by buddytv while paste named it the sixth best sitcom of  in  the writers guild of america placed it at  on their list of  best written tv series the show has some superficial similarities to the comic strip dilbert which also features employees coping with an inept superior john spector ceo of the conference board says that both show the impact a leader can have for good or bad dilbert creator scott adams also touts the similarities the lesson from the office and from dilbert is that people are often dysfunctional and no amount of training can fix it a laboraffiliated group praised the episode boys and girls for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on american television metacritic a review aggregation website only graded the first third sixth and final seasons however it denoted that all four of them received generally favorable reviews from critics awarding a    and  score—out of —to each of them respectively it later named it the thirteenth most mentioned series on best of decade topten lists the office now is a pale listless shadow of what it used to be —alan sepinwall of hitfix in september  the last few seasons were criticized for a dip in quality the sixth season received criticisms for a lack of stakes for the characters other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the jim and pam romance the office cocreator ricky gervais wrote in his blog referring to search committee particularly warren buffetts guest appearance if youre going to jump a shark jump a big one and compared the episode to the chris martin episode of gervaiss other series extras although he later said on his website i fucking didnt diss the office thats for sure some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of steve carell rainn wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes creatively such as the chemistry between spader and helms which he called a bit dark and argued that the show
