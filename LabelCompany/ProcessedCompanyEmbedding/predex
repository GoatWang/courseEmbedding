effects of precedex patients should be continuously monitored while receiving precedex hypotension bradycardia and sinus arrest clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with precedex administration in young healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with precedex infusion some of these cases have resulted in fatalities if medical intervention is required treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of precedex increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration elevation of the lower extremities and use of pressor agents because precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli clinicians should be prepared to intervene the intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents eg glycopyrrolate atropine should be considered to modify vagal tone in clinical trials glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of precedexinduced bradycardia however in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction more advanced resuscitative measures were required caution should be exercised when administering precedex to patients with advanced heart block andor severe ventricular dysfunction because precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity hypotension andor bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients in clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were coadministered with precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed nonetheless caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with precedex transient hypertension transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of precedex treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable arousability some patients receiving precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated this alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms withdrawal intensive care unit sedation with administration up to  days regardless of dose   precedex adult subjects experienced at least  event related to withdrawal within the first

sevoflurane isoflurane propofol alfentanil and midazolam no pharmacokinetic interactions between precedex and isoflurane propofol alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated however due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions when coadministered with precedex a reduction in dosage of precedex or the concomitant anesthetic sedative hypnotic or opioid may be required neuromuscular blockers in one study of  healthy adult volunteers administration of precedex for  minutes at a plasma concentration of one ngml resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration use in specific populations pregnancy pregnancy category c there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies of precedex use in pregnant women in an in vitro human placenta study placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred in a study in the pregnant rat placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously thus fetal exposure should be expected in humans and precedex should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis from gestation day  to  with doses up to  mcgkg representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis from gestation day  to  with doses up to  mcgkg representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the timecurve comparison however fetal toxicity as evidenced by increased postimplantation losses and reduced live pups was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of  mcgkg the noeffect dose in rats was  mcgkg representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison in another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at  and  mcgkg representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison from gestation day  through weaning lower offspring weights were observed additionally when offspring of the  mcgkg group were allowed to mate elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring labor and delivery the safety of precedex during labor and delivery has not been studied nursing mothers it is not known whether precedex is excreted in human milk radiolabeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be exercised when precedex is administered to a nursing woman pediatric use safety and efficacy have not been established for procedural or icu sedation in pediatric patients one assessorblinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for icu sedation these studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of precedex for this patient population the use of precedex for procedural sedation in pediatric patients has not been evaluated geriatric use intensive care unit sedation a total of  patients in the clinical studies were  years of age and over a total of  patients were  years of age and over in patients greater than  years of age a higher incidence of bradycardia and

higher incidence in precedextreated patients  years or older  and  years or older  as compared to patients  years  a reduced loading dose of  mcgkg given over  minutes is recommended and a reduction in the maintenance infusion should be considered for patients greater than  years of age hepatic impairment since precedex clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function see dosage and administration  and clinical pharmacology  drug abuse and dependence controlled substance precedex dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is not a controlled substance dependence the dependence potential of precedex has not been studied in humans however since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that precedex exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine it is possible that precedex may produce a clonidinelike withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation see warnings and precautions  overdosage the tolerability of precedex was studied in one study in which healthy adult subjects were administered doses at and above the recommended dose of  to  mcgkghr the maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately  times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range the most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block no hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute five adult patients received an overdose of precedex in the intensive care unit sedation studies two of these patients had no symptoms reported one patient received a  mcgkg loading dose over  minutes twice the recommended loading dose and one patient received a maintenance infusion of  mcgkghr two other patients who received a  mcgkg loading dose over  minutes experienced bradycardia andor

binding was  and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested protein binding was similar in males and females the fraction of precedex that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects the potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl ketorolac theophylline digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of precedex were observed the potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin warfarin ibuprofen propranolol theophylline and digoxin by precedex was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by precedex metabolism dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome p mediated metabolism the major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are direct nglucuronidation to inactive metabolites aliphatic hydroxylation mediated primarily by cypa with a minor role of cypa cype cypd and cypc of dexmedetomidine to generate hydroxydexmedetomidine the glucuronide of hydroxydexmedetomidine and carboxydexmedetomidine and nmethylation of dexmedetomidine to generate hydroxy nmethyldexmedetomidine carboxy nmethyldexmedetomidine and dexmedetomidinenmethyl oglucuronide elimination the terminal elimination halflife t of dexmedetomidine is approximately  hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately  lh a mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of  of the radioactivity following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was recovered in the urine and  in the feces no unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine approximately  of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within  hours after the infusion fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of nglucuronidation accounted for approximately  of the cumulative urinary excretion in addition aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form hydroxydexmedetomidine the glucuronide of hydroxydexmedetomidine and carboxylic aciddexmedetomidine together represented approximately  of the dose in urine nmethylation of dexmedetomidine to form hydroxy nmethyl dexmedetomidine carboxy nmethyl dexmedetomidine and nmethyl oglucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately  of the dose in urine the nmethyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine approximately  of the urinary metabolites have not been identified gender there was no observed difference in precedex pharmacokinetics due to

administration precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting due to the known pharmacological effects of precedex patients should be continuously monitored while receiving precedex  hypotension bradycardia and sinus arrest clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with precedex administration in young healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with precedex infusion some of these cases have resulted in fatalities if medical intervention is required treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of precedex increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration elevation of the lower extremities and use of pressor agents because precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli clinicians should be prepared to intervene the intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents eg glycopyrrolate atropine should be considered to modify vagal tone in clinical trials glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of precedexinduced bradycardia however in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction more advanced resuscitative measures were required caution should be exercised when administering precedex to patients with advanced heart block andor severe ventricular dysfunction because precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity hypotension andor bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients in clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were coadministered with precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed nonetheless caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with precedex  transient hypertension transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of precedex treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable  arousability some patients receiving precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated this alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms  withdrawal intensive care unit sedation with administration up to  days regardless of dose   precedex adult subjects experienced at least  event related to withdrawal within the first

anesthetics sedatives hypnotics opioids coadministration of precedex with anesthetics sedatives hypnotics and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane isoflurane propofol alfentanil and midazolam no pharmacokinetic interactions between precedex and isoflurane propofol alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated however due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions when coadministered with precedex a reduction in dosage of precedex or the concomitant anesthetic sedative hypnotic or opioid may be required  neuromuscular blockers in one study of  healthy adult volunteers administration of precedex for  minutes at a plasma concentration of one ngml resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the

precedex use in pregnant women in an in vitro human placenta study placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred in a study in the pregnant rat placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously thus fetal exposure should be expected in humans and precedex should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis from gestation day  to  with doses up to  mcgkg representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis from gestation day  to  with doses up to  mcgkg representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the timecurve comparison however fetal toxicity as evidenced by increased postimplantation losses and reduced live pups was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of  mcgkg the noeffect dose in rats was  mcgkg representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison in another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at  and  mcgkg representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison from gestation day  through weaning lower offspring weights were observed additionally when offspring of the  mcgkg group were allowed to mate elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring  labor and delivery the safety of precedex during labor and delivery has not been studied  nursing mothers it is not known whether precedex is excreted in human milk radiolabeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be exercised

recommended dose of  to  mcgkghr the maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately  times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range the most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block no hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute five adult patients received an overdose of precedex in the intensive care unit sedation studies two of these patients had no symptoms reported one patient received a  mcgkg loading dose over  minutes twice the recommended loading dose and one patient received a maintenance infusion of  mcgkghr two other patients who received a  mcgkg loading dose over

subjects the average protein binding was  and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested protein binding was similar in males and females the fraction of precedex that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects the potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl ketorolac theophylline digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of precedex were observed the potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin warfarin ibuprofen propranolol theophylline and digoxin by precedex was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by precedex metabolism dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome p mediated metabolism the major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are direct nglucuronidation to inactive metabolites aliphatic hydroxylation mediated primarily by cypa with a minor role of cypa cype cypd and cypc of dexmedetomidine to generate hydroxydexmedetomidine the glucuronide of hydroxydexmedetomidine and carboxydexmedetomidine and nmethylation of dexmedetomidine to generate hydroxy nmethyldexmedetomidine carboxy nmethyldexmedetomidine and dexmedetomidinenmethyl oglucuronide elimination the terminal elimination halflife t of dexmedetomidine is approximately  hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately  lh a mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of  of the radioactivity following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was recovered in the urine and  in the feces no unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine approximately  of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within  hours after the infusion fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of nglucuronidation accounted for approximately  of the cumulative urinary excretion in addition aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form hydroxydexmedetomidine the glucuronide of hydroxydexmedetomidine and carboxylic aciddexmedetomidine together represented approximately  of the dose in urine nmethylation of dexmedetomidine to form hydroxy nmethyl dexmedetomidine carboxy nmethyl dexmedetomidine and nmethyl oglucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately  of the dose in urine the nmethyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine approximately  of the urinary metabolites have not been identified gender there was no observed difference in precedex

precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting due to the known pharmacological effects of precedex patients should be continuously monitored while receiving precedex  hypotension bradycardia and sinus arrest clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with precedex administration in young healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with precedex infusion some of these cases have resulted in fatalities if medical intervention is required treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of precedex increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration elevation of the lower extremities and use of pressor agents because precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli clinicians should be prepared to intervene the intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents eg glycopyrrolate atropine should be considered to modify vagal tone in clinical trials glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of precedexinduced bradycardia however in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction more advanced resuscitative measures were required caution should be exercised when administering precedex to patients with advanced heart block andor severe ventricular dysfunction because precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity hypotension andor bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients in clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were coadministered with precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed nonetheless caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with precedex  transient hypertension transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of precedex treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable  arousability some patients receiving precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated this alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms  withdrawal intensive care unit sedation with administration up to  days regardless of dose   precedex adult subjects experienced at least  event related to withdrawal within the first

predex is an interval fund designed to offer access to private core real estate through investment in flagship us core property funds managed by leading institutional real estate sponsors most of the targeted institutional private funds are included in the nfiodce index “odce index” the underlying institutional funds own highquality office industrial retail and apartment properties primarily located across the top  us metropolitan areas income from these properties after expenses is passed through the funds to predex which provides quarterly distributions to its shareholders how predex works what is the odce index predex operates within the nfiodce index “odce index” guidelines for leverage property type and geographic diversification since  the index has been widely used to represent the stabilized incomeproducing commercial and multifamily real estate market funds included in the index invest in private equity real estate and operate under a strict set of criteria real estate at least  of the market value of net assets must be invested in real estate and no more than  in cash or cash equivalents private equity at least  of the market value of real estate must be invested in private equity real estate properties and no more than  in real estate debt instruments domain at least  of the market value of real estate must be invested in the us property types at

annual audits quarterly valuations and timeweighted returns the predex structure predex is designed to provide an institutionalquality real estate investment to investors predex provides access to private core real estate through the convenience of a mutual fund please browse through the topics below to find out more about investing in predex fund objective predex seeks stable income and longterm capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of flagship us core property funds managed by leading institutional real estate sponsors our underlying funds own interests in more than  properties valued at more than  billion why can’t predex be a pure index fund predex cannot be a pure nfiodce index fund because to do so it would have to own all of the member funds weighted by their net asset values—an impossible task due to the uneven timing of capital calls and quarterly liquidity predex seeks to be as close to a “beta” fund as possible and represent the characteristics of the nfiodce index interval funds and redemptions as an interval fund predex offers quarterly share repurchases for no less than  and no more than  of the fund’s total shares outstanding share repurchases are offered at net asset value nav all of an investor’s tendered shares will be repurchased if the combined total shares tendered by all investors is less than the repurchase offer amount if total shareholder requests exceed the repurchase offer amount predex will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis there is no guarantee that an investor will be able to sell all shares in a repurchase offer quarterly share redemption is available throughout the life of the fund daily nav pricing like openend mutual funds predex provides transparency through daily pricing at net asset value nav this is different from publicly traded real estate securities which are priced based on daily trading activity it is believed that appraisal nav pricing may contribute to less volatility of predex shares fees predex offers a lowcost passive ‘beta’ investment strategy which means that management fees may be lower than those of other investment options the annual asset management fee is  with total annual fund expenses including the management fee estimated to be  subject to a  limitation minimum initial investment while the minimum investment in predex is  with preapproval the minimum can be waived by
