ratings what are nnn properties nnn properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a  to  year term nnn properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all if not most of the expenses the investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement tenants in nnn properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in qualitatively nnn properties have either credit or non credit tenants the most desirable least risk nnn properties have investment grade rated bbb and better credit tenants non credit tenant nnn properties have tenants that are not credit rated these tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books click tenant ratings for list of tenants for nnn properties who buys nnn properties nnn properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility the alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or reit or invest in fractional ownership tenant in common properties a major advantage of  direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a  exchange when the property is sold for many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in nnn properties is offset by the lack of volatility nnn properties offer when compared to a securitized investment investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in nnn properties how are nnn properties valued nnn properties typically are valued using their capitalization rate also referred to as cap rate nnn properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the net operating income noi for nnn properties noi is income less all expenses before debt service the cap rate is the noi divided by the purchase price for nnn properties conversely the noi divided by the cap rate will equal the purchase or selling price example of cap rates for nnn properties noi   purchase or selling price noi   cap rate how are cap rates determined for nnn properties some of the major considerations when calculating cap rates for nnn properties are the credit worthiness of the tenant the length of the lease typically  to  years the type of lease triple net nnn or double net nn see below for definition type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent cost of financing strength of the demographics of the property location nature of the improvements are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting age and condition of the improvements the more positive the above factors for nnn properties the lower the cap rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream conversely if the above factors for nnn properties are weak the cap rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment it is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low cap rate nnn properties are not necessary a lower risk investment they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced astute investors seek nnn properties that are mispriced in their favor namely a higher cap rate for a property that has lower risk factors what is buildtosuit in a buildtosuit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a net lease the net lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project this arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost the net lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term making the tenants aftertax cost less than with alternative forms of assetbased financing what is a ground lease a ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements building from the ownership of the underlying fee ground typically ground leases are long term net leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant in some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements on unsubordinated ground lease no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land instead the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements there is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease many investors favor ground leases because they dont need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease when the net lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenants cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs a long term net lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes typically ground leases are long term net leases and include set rent escalations foreclosure rights and reversionary right improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease what is a sale leaseback a real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a net lease the seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business a long term net lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well types net leases nnn properties are generally categorized as either true triple net nnn or double net nn the distinction between nnn and nn leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions absolute triple net nnn the tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance repairs taxes and replacement for the entire property without limitation the owners pay the mortgage only this is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing nnn properties bond lease nnn a bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple nnn lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property ie even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings double net lease nn similar to nnn leases but with additional owner responsibilities the owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof foundation loadbearing walls and parking leases will vary so they should be carefully read net lease alternative for investors considering nnn properties but who would like to invest less capital cash and still have little to no management responsibilities fractional ownership can be a good option to consider advantages of fractional properties are the lower minimum investment starting at  greater diversification prepackaged financing if any and due diligence material unlike a stock or bond fractional ownership can qualify for  and  exchanges providing they follow irs guidelines click

presentation steve steve klinsky the team will go through the details in a moment but let me start by presenting the highlights of another successful quarter for new mountain finance new mountain finance’s adjusted net investment income for the quarter ended march   was  per share in the middle of our guidance of  to  per share and once again covering our quarterly dividend of  per share new mountain finance’s book value was  per share as compared to  per share last quarter or  increase per share we’re also able to announce our regular dividend for the current quarter which will again be  per share and annualized yield in excess of  based on last friday’s close the company had a very productive quarter of deal generation invest in  million in gross originations repayments in the quarter were  million the significant increase in activity was partially funded by the  million equity offering we completed in early april i and other members of new mountain continued to be very large owners of our stock with aggregate ownership of  million shares or approximately  of total shares outstanding in summary we are pleased with nmfc’s continued performance and progress overall with that let me turn the call back over to rob hamwee nmfc’s ceo rob hamwee thank you steve before diving into the details of the quarter as always i’d like to give everyone a brief review of nmfc and our strategy as outlined on page  of our presentation nmfc is externally managed by new mountain capital a leading private equity firm since the inception of our debt investment program in  we have taken new mountain’s approach to private equity and applied it to corporate credit with a consistent focus on defensive growth business model and extensive fundamental research within industries that are already well known to new mountain or more simply put we invest in recession resistant businesses that we really know and that we really like we believe this approach results in a differentiated and sustainable model that allows us to generate attractive risk adjusted rates of return across changing cycles and market conditions to achieve our mandate we utilized the existing new mountain investment team as our primary underwriting resource turning to page  you can see our total return performance from ipo in may  through may   in the six years since our ipo we have generated a compounded annual return to our initial public investors of  meaningfully higher than our peers in the high yield index and well over  basis points per annum above relevant risk free benchmarks page  goes into a little more detail around relative performance against our peers that benchmarking against the ten largest externally managed bdcs that have been public at least as long as we have page  shows return attribution total cumulative return continues to be largely driven by our cash dividend which in turn has been more than  covered by nii as the bar on the far right illustrates over the six years we have been public we have effectively maintained a stable book value inclusive of special dividends while generating  cash on cash return for our shareholders fully supported by net investment income we are very happy to be able to deliver this performance over a period of time where risk free rates have been effectively zero and will strive to continue this performance we attribute our success to one our differentiated underwriting platform two our ability to consistently generate the vast majority of our nii from stable cash interest income three our focus on running the business with an efficient balance sheet and always fully utilizing inexpensive appropriately structured leverage before accessing more expensive equity and four our alignment of shareholder and management interests our highest priority continues to be our focus on risk control and credit performance which we believe over time is the single biggest differentiator of total return in the bdc space if you refer to page  we once again layout the cost basis of our investments both the current portfolio and our cumulative investments since the inception of our credit business in  and then show what is migrated down the performance ladder since inception we have made investments of over  billion in  portfolio companies of which only  representing just  million of cost have migrated to nonaccrual and only  representing  million of costs have thus far resulted in realized default losses this  million figure included our  realized loss in transtar which has now been fully incurred and the balance of the position monetized approximately  of our portfolio at fair market value is currently rated one or two on our internal scale page  shows leverage multiple for all of our holdings above  million when we entered an investment and leverage levels for the same investment as of the end of the most recent reporting period while not a perfect metric the asset by asset trend in leverage multiple is a good snapshot of credit performance and helps provide some degree of empirical fundamental support for our internal ratings and marks as you can see by looking at the table leverage multiples are roughly flat or trending in the right direction with only a few exceptions two loans that shown negative migration of  terms or more one which we have discussed for a number of quarter is sierra hamilton where restructuring talks continue and underlying business trends are improving the second is a high quality business that have save to certain end market challenges and where we expect financial metrics to approve – to improve in coming quarters the company has significant cash flow and liquidity and should have no issue servicing its debt for the foreseeable future the chart on page  helps track the company’s overall economic performance since its ipo at the top of the page we show the regular quarterly dividend is being covered out of net investment income as you can see we continue to more than cover  of our cumulative regular dividend out of nii on the bottom of the page we focus on below the line items first we look at realized gains and realized credit and other losses as you can see looking at the row highlighted in green we’ve had success generating real economic gains every year through a combination of equity gains portfolio company dividends and trading profits conversely realized losses including default losses highlighted in orange have generally been smaller and less frequent and show that we are typically not avoiding nonaccruals by selling poor credit at a material loss prior to actual default despite our first significant realized loss since our ipo we continue to have a net cumulative realized gain of  million highlighted in blue looking further down the page we can see that cumulative net unrealized appreciation highlighted in grey stands at  million and cumulative net realized and unrealized loss highlighted in yellow is at  million an improvement of  million from last quarter i will now turn the call over to john kline nmfc’s president to discuss market conditions and portfolio activity john john kline thanks rob as outlined on page  the credit markets are stronger today than they have been since we went public in  spreads are uniformly tighter across all of the leverage finance asset classes in which we invest including first lien unit tranche second lien bonds mezzanine and preferred while pricing premiums for middle market assets still exist the spreads compared to the syndicated market have narrowed leverage levels for the highest quality companies have not materially changed in recent quarters however more of lower quality companies are getting access to the highest levels of leverage which makes credit selection extremely important investors are aware of this increased risk but still view direct lending strategies as an attractive relative value compared to index credit and equities while banks are not active lenders in our market that do play a large role in the continued decline of clo liability spreads which are powerful driver of broader market loan pricing more than ever we rely on the important for our disciplined focus on defensive growth industries and differentiate access to deal flow afforded to us by the broader new mountain platform turning to page  nmfc continues to be well positioned in the event of future rate increases as  of our portfolio is invested in floating rate debt meanwhile we have locked in  of our liabilities at fixed rates to ensure attractive borrowing costs over the mediumterm three months libor has increased to  basis points which is slightly above the average libor floor on our floating rate assets as the chart on the bottom of the page shows given our investment portfolio and liability mix nmfc is very strongly positioned in the event of an increase in shortterm rates even a moderate increase in base rates of  basis points at  or  to our annual net investment income moving on to portfolio activity as seen on pages  and  consistent with the strong pipeline that we mentioned on the last call we saw a robust new origination activity in q total originations were  million offset by  million of repayments and  million of sale proceeds yielding net investment income of  million our new originations were highlighted by hi technology amwins and crgt all three investments highlight the advantages of the nmc sourcing platform hi technology were sourced to our private equity teams relationship with the founder amwins the former nmc fund three portfolio company and crgt has been a longterm nmfc investment where we have partnered with the company and the sponsor to steadily grow through acquisitions since the end of the quarter despite the very competitive deal environment we have continued our strong investment pace with  million of new investments offset by  million of sales and repayments based on our pipeline of both committed and anticipated deals we expect to maintain our solid new investment momentum into the summer months turning to page  we show the breakout of investments by asset type while our repayments were relatively consistent with our historical mix our originations by asset type were impacted by our large preferred stock investment in hi technology excluding this investment our mix was consistent with our historical experience as shown on page  in q asset yields on new originations were a bright spot for us nmfc had an average yield on new origination of  which enabled us to maintain a portfolio yield inclusive of the impact of the forward curve in excess of  going forward given the competitive deal environment we expect modest spread compression compared to our historical portfolio of spreads however we believe that any spread compression could be offset by rising base rates leaving nominal yields on our portfolio stable on the top of page  we show a balanced portfolio across our defensive growth oriented sectors in the services section of the pie chart we now show a breakout of subsectors to give better insight into the diversity within our largest sector on the bottom of the page we continue to maintain our targeted mix between senior and subordinated investments and on the lower right we show that the vast majority of our portfolio continues to perform at or above our expectations finally as illustrated on page  we have a broadly diversified portfolio with our largest investment at  of fair value and the top  investments accounting for  of fair value with that i will now turn it over to our cfo shiraz kajee to discuss the financial statements and key financial metrics shiraz shiraz kajee thank you john for more details on our financial results in today’s commentary please refer to the form q that was filed last evening with the sec now i’d like to turn your attention to slide  the portfolio had approximately  billion in investments at fair value at march   and total assets of  billion with total liabilities at  million of which total statutory debt outstanding was  million excluding  million of drawn sbaguaranteed debentures net asset value of  million or  per share was up  from the prior quarter as of march  our statutory debt to equity ratio was  to  on slide  we show our historical leverage ratios which are broadly consistent with our current target statutory leverage of between  and  to  though we finish the quarter to highend of the range the ratio has come back down to low end of the range with almost recent equity offerings we also show our historical nav adjusted for the cumulative impact of special dividends which portrays a more accurate reflection of true economic value creation on slide  we show our quarterly income statement results we believe that our adjusted nii is the most appropriate measure of our quarterly performance this slide highlights that while realized and unrealized gains and losses can be volatile below the line we continue to generate stable net investment income above the line focusing on the quarter ended march   we earned total investment income of approximately  million this was slightly down from the prior quarter due to a decline in nonrecurring fee income on the expense side interest and operating expense will modestly higher from prior quarter the cover shortfall in preincentive fee operating income the investment and by the way the portion of its incentive fee also as in prior quarters the investment advisor continues to waive certain management fees such that the effective annualized management fee is  it’s important to note that the investment advisor cannot recoup previously waived this results in first quarter adjusted nii of  million or  per weighted average share which in line with guidance and covers our q regular dividend of  per share in total for the quarter ended march   we had an increase in net assets resulting from operations of  million slide  demonstrates our total investment income is recurring in nature and predominantly paid in cash as you can see  of total investment income is recurring and cash income remained strong at  this quarter we believe this consistency shows stability and predictability of our investment income as mentioned earlier you can see the decrease in investment income this quarter was driven by decline in nonrecurring fee income turning to slide  our adjusted nii for the first quarter covered our q dividend we now believe that our q  adjusted nii will fall within our guidance of  to  per share our board of directors has declared a q  dividend of  per share in line with the past  quarters the q  quarterly dividend of  per share will be paid on june   to holders of record on june   finally on slide  we highlight our various financing sources taken into account sbaguaranteed debentures we had a little over  billion of total borrowing capacity at quarter end with no nearterm maturities as a reminder our wells fargo credit facility’s covenants are generally tied to the operating performance of the underlying businesses that we lend to rather than the marks of our investment at any given time with that i’d like to turn the call back over to rob rob hamwee thanks shiraz it continues to remain our intention to consistently pay the  per share on a quarterly basis for future quarters so long as the adjusted nii covers the dividend in line with our current expectations in closing i would just like to say that we continue to be pleased with our performance to date most importantly from a credit perspective our overall portfolio continues to be healthy once again we’d like to thank you for your support and interest and at this point turn things back to the operator to begin qa operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of jonathan bock of wells fargo securities jonathan bock good morning and thank you for taking my questions rob hamwee hey jonathan jonathan bock hey rob so when we looking at the last equity raise sort of  million or so give or take and then we look at kind of the math when you include credit losses to effectively make that accretive from an noi perspective understanding that you wouldn’t do anything that’s not accretive from nav perspective looking at new investment yields with first lien at  second lien at  help us in terms of how we bridge the gap to that effective cost i know you talked about the potential for rate rising et cetera but what are some of the other plugs that you’re using to effectively raise net return on the portfolio to hit what would be the effective cost of capital of that recent equity brought on balance sheet rob hamwee yes sure sure jonathan so couple of things right that there is obviously the rising rate environment there is always the mix when you think of things that we’re doing when you look at what we did in q with an  which is meaningful in excess of our target range we also have the second sba license expected to come on board they’ve mentioned before right that’s not the fee very accretive so it’s really the combination of all those things that we’re not talking about dramatic swings right we’ve been very very consistent rate at which we’ve deployed the capital and so the other thing that’s really important as the private credit markets continue to evolve is our scale is increasingly allowing us to get access to lead positions in deals that the otherwise wouldn’t have happened that scale is also generally accretive to the overall ability to source and execute on the – the deal that we want to do jonathan bock and rob you’ve got about  million of additional capacity under the sba i think we’d be – maybe it wouldn’t be a thought that a lot of that could have been eased up pretty perhaps by now and can you talked about the second license on – coming online here in the very near future what are some of the limiting factor to effectively deploying that capital are you just finding not enough deals that necessarily fit the sbic bucket or are you finding that it’s just a matter of audit et cetera sometimes that can slow the process down rob hamwee yes i mean it’s a number of things i mean the important thing is we never do a deal to fill a bucket right we only do deals and businesses we know well through the private equity platform and then based on that knowledge we feel very very good about their prospects so we always resist the temptation to say oh we have a more accretive bucket we can put something in let’s do a deal to put it in that bucket that being said we did have we basically finished the open capital with the allegis deal that we did in late april that you can see on page  where we put the full  million allowance into the into the sba entity so we’re pretty ramp and we can get a repayment tomorrow who knows but we don’t really have any room left there so getting that second license will open up some meaningful incremental capabilities jonathan bock and then just a small accounting question is – what was the reasoning behind the net lease corp consolidation on the balance sheet this quarter rob hamwee shiraz you want to… shiraz kajee yes talk about that i mean so we continuously review all of the consolidations every quarter with our accountants to make sure we got the right approach to how we go about doing things so looking at the ramp in the net lease we’ve only done four deals to date those deals look to be slightly more passive in nature than active in terms of creating there’s an operating company and not consolidating so we made a decision to consolidated at this point but that could change in the future jonathan bock so the commission logic that’s actually go back and forth the next item is would it be fair to say that you wouldn’t consolidate if you did not see additional growth in that vertical on a forward basis right because the point was to get higher yielding returns and what you would be receiving which is why the reasoning was to keep it off balance sheet or am i missing something rob hamwee yes we’re just to be clear jonathan this is purely a accounting nonsubstantive issue remember that the net lease entity invest down at individual spv’s – lease resides in where we have nonrecourse leverage that leverage is not consolidated whether we do or do not consolidate the reit jonathan bock okay got it rob hamwee there’s no impact on our leverage ratio whether we consolidated the reit or don’t consolidate the reit because again we’re leveraging the individual asset with nonrecourse debt down at individual a leaf by leaf or property by property spv’s jonathan bock got it okay great thank you thank you for taking my questions rob hamwee yes great thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from the line of paul johnson of kbw please go ahead rob hamwee hi paul paul johnson hi guys good morning thanks for taking my question my first question was in regards to the fee waiver approximately  million or so that you guys waived during the quarter was that something that’s totally voluntary and i guess what was the motivation behind it and then some of that we would expect to see in the coming quarters as well if needed rob hamwee yes i mean – look paul yes first of all clearly it’s totally voluntary we’ve always say that covering our dividend out of nii is one of our absolute primary driver with the business that in avoiding losses of the really the two fundamental tenants of the business so it’s a lever we have to prolonged certainly not going to fit here and say that we’re committed to doing that every quarter but we do have a long history as you know of shareholder friendly and – transparency and that’s – it’s all part of that continuing so i think we feel that the business is capable in the coming quarters of being in the  or  range but it’s certainly an option we do have if we were to have another shortfall down the road and again remember it’s really the core was fine and we had a little bit of volatility around the nonrecurring we had virtually no prepayment income that quarter which is – this quarter which is obviously very volatile so we’re talking about pretty small dollar and it’s just another tool we have to make sure we’re delivering on what we sort of covenant to our shareholders paul johnson okay and just to be clear i mean that was outside of the regular agreed upon a few waivers that you guys haven’t place this is something that was done voluntarily by management rob hamwee that is correct that is incremental to the thing we’ve been doing since our ipo in terms of the senior assets that initially we’re in a different well facility where we get more to return to leverage and they’re always had been charging on the leverage of that facility and then as you recall we consolidated that facility and then have been waiving on those assets ever since so yes we have the  sort of headline fee is really historically – consistently been about  that’s on the base management fee and then this was a  voluntary waiver of some increment of the performance fee paul johnson okay that’s great thanks my other question headed to with your investment in hi technology roughly  million obviously a large investment i just wondering if you guys can give a little color on kind of what attracted you to the company to make such a large investment and also a preferred equity investment versus what you’ve done more historically with the debt to senior debt positions you’ve taken rob hamwee yes absolutely i mean for this is something we’re really excited about i’m glad you brought it up this is a transaction we’ve been working on for virtually a year on the private equity side and something that we initially it’s in one of our core spaces and we’ll identify the company as a real sort of niche market leader and we’re able to – it’s a founder owned and controlled wealthy large large business and the founder was really interested in working with us because of some ability we had to the potentially help him with some customer acquisition and so as we went through the reps and did all the diligence on private equity and thought about different transaction structures ultimately it didn’t fit into our classic control buy up mode just because the owner was not yet ready to make that move so that kind of became more and more of a smaller for the fee fund minority type investment where the founder was also very focused on dilution we really kind of more fit into a great contractual return opportunity and we still have – we have one our key partners on the board now and so we still have a great strategic dialogue with the company but this is really i think show us the power of the platform to deliver in a tough credit environment to deliver differentiated very proprietary opportunities that are both attractively structured and attractively priced and the other element was from our credit – with our credit heads on is very low leverage i mean we’re talking about a sub four times leverage through the preferred in an enterprise that is worth a doubledigit te multiple and then on top of that we are always looking for opportunities to build book value through capital appreciation and in addition to being a contractual return type of security it also has a convertibility feature to it such that if the business does some of the things we actually expected to do based on our private equity underwriting there’s real upside from a capital gain perspective so this is really one of the most compelling opportunity if we see and that’s drove our desire and willingness to do it in the scale we’ve done it paul johnson sure yes thanks for that’s really good color i have two shorter questions if that’s okay rob hamwee yes of course paul johnson about different stuff one is just a smaller one i just – as i kind of look at your interest income sort of yearoveryear it comes down from about  million to – i mean they does get a little bit of dividend income in there as well  million to  million yearoveryear i mean i know there’s a lot of originations in the quarter is that mostly because of the timing thing with the originations being falling took a later half of the quarter or what we see now a better run rate of kind of what interest incomes going to look like on the portfolio or to get dividing thing around that rob hamwee yes it’s a combination yes we were definitely skew towards late in the quarter from the origination side versus the repayment side was skewed earlier in the quarter so there’s some of that there’s also some mix there and when you think about the interest income and the dividend income i mean those dividend numbers are also very – that’s effectively contractual those are not sort of nonrecurring dividends right because you’re looking at the – and if you look you can see it better on page  but we talk about kind of the cash interesting you can see much greater stability there and then you’ve always been allocating more capital for the slp as we ramp up slp ii and so there’s a mix issue right a bigger percentage of the balance sheet so you really got to look at that recurring cash investment income line paul johnson sure rob hamwee on page  i think see the more the more meaningful trend from an operating metrics perspective paul johnson sure okay that makes sense my last question is just about the net lease corp i guess just if you had any commentary on what your plans are for growth there if any – and then also just kind of a side question to that is if you guys planned on providing any more disclosure on that i guess in the future if you were to grow it more… rob hamwee yes i think in terms of our plans for the mediumterm it’s really just doing more of what we’ve been doing and again being disciplined and opportunistic and again not trying to fill up a bucket for the sake of filling up a bucket we’re out in the marketplace and the net lease team here which we added last year as you know actively looking at new opportunities that are consistent with our criteria around risk and return and when we find those opportunities will execute on them and when we don’t – we won’t and so we don’t have we’re not slave to some nonobjective growth target there we will see where it goes and it does provide nice outlet for incremental kind of proprietary following the deal flow and in terms of disclosure down the road i feel like we’re giving pretty good disclosure i think if it were to get more material we could certainly talk about increasing the level of disclosure there but given the current materiality i think we feel pretty comfortable with what we’re laying out paul johnson okay can you guy’s remind me what you’re target leverage is within the net lease corp rob hamwee so again the assets are leveraged down at individual spv so there is no actual leverage at the reit itself the individual assets tend to be levered at about  to  loan to value paul johnson okay okay well thanks for taking my question there’s a lot a help and take care rob hamwee yes i know happy to do it thanks for the question operator operator instruction the next question comes from the line of chris kotowski of oppenheimer please go ahead rob hamwee hey chris chris kotowski yes hi good morning just on the disclosure and on the net lease corporation i’m looking at the q page  and there you breakdown the individual investments and a couple questions on that first i mean i add up all the dividend income and divided by  million i get around an  yield so the first question is that roughly what we should see going forward is that kind of a run rate rob hamwee yes that’s pretty – that is consistence you recall the net lease one of the things we like about it is there are escalators built in to leases unlike commercial loans and there is real duration there so these are  year plus or minus leases so all that equal about numbers should actually trend up overtime the escalators are – they are  to  per year but that compounds on itself but yes you’re thinking about it correctly chris kotowski okay and then secondly you said there were four deals i see five here shiraz kajee one of the deals – was two components there was a us piece and a canadian piece of that chris kotowski okay shiraz kajee but it’s the same company chris kotowski okay and then in the future let’s say you want to do another  million of deals in the second quarter or third quarter whatever should we expect to see more in the – in your terms of your disclosure should we expect to see more capital flow into the  million equity that we saw at the start or will they just show up as individual investments shiraz kajee so going forward they’ll show up as individual investments chris kotowski okay and then finally just when we look at this like – if you look at the app canada you see  million that represents your equity commitment to that right rob hamwee yes that’s the portion of the  million that we’ve down streamed for the reit to the spv chris kotowski and then that  million is levered  to  rob hamwee yes it still represents roughly  million chris kotowski okay rob hamwee purchase of a building or a set of building chris kotowski bingo got it thank you rob hamwee thanks chris kotowski okay that’s it for me rob hamwee okay thanks operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to rob hamwee for any closing remarks rob hamwee as always thank you

what are nnn properties nnn properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a  to  year term nnn properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all if not most of the expenses the investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement tenants in nnn properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in qualitatively nnn properties have either credit or non credit tenants the most desirable least risk nnn properties have investment grade rated bbb and better credit tenants non credit tenant nnn properties have tenants that are not credit rated these tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books click tenant ratings for list of tenants for nnn properties who buys nnn properties nnn properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility the alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or reit or invest in fractional ownership tenant in common properties a major advantage of  direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a  exchange when the property is sold for many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in nnn properties is offset by the lack of volatility nnn properties offer when compared to a securitized investment investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in nnn properties how are nnn properties valued nnn properties typically are valued using their capitalization rate also referred to as cap rate nnn properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the net operating income noi for nnn properties noi is income less all expenses before debt service the cap rate is the noi divided by the purchase price for nnn properties conversely the noi divided by the cap rate will equal the purchase or selling price example of cap rates for nnn properties noi   purchase or selling price noi   cap rate how are cap rates determined for nnn properties some of the major considerations when calculating cap rates for nnn properties are the credit worthiness of the tenant the length of the lease typically  to  years the type of lease triple net nnn or double net nn see below for definition type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent cost of financing strength of the demographics of the property location nature of the improvements are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting age and condition of the improvements the more positive the above factors for nnn properties the lower the cap rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream conversely if the above factors for nnn properties are weak the cap rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment it is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low cap rate nnn properties are not necessary a lower risk investment they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced astute investors seek nnn properties that are mispriced in their favor namely a higher cap rate for a property that has lower risk factors what is buildtosuit in a buildtosuit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a net lease the net lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project this arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost the net lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term making the tenants aftertax cost less than with alternative forms of assetbased financing what is a ground lease a ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements building from the ownership of the underlying fee ground typically ground leases are long term net leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant in some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements on unsubordinated ground lease no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land instead the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements there is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease many investors favor ground leases because they dont need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease when the net lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenants cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs a long term net lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes typically ground leases are long term net leases and include set rent escalations foreclosure rights and reversionary right improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease what is a sale leaseback a real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a net lease the seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business a long term net lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well types net leases nnn properties are generally categorized as either true triple net nnn or double net nn the distinction between nnn and nn leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions absolute triple net nnn the tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance repairs taxes and replacement for the entire property without limitation the owners pay the mortgage only this is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing nnn properties bond lease nnn a bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple nnn lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property ie even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings double net lease nn similar to nnn leases but with additional owner responsibilities the owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof foundation loadbearing walls and parking leases will vary so they should be carefully read net lease alternative for investors considering nnn properties but who would like to invest less capital cash and still have little to no management responsibilities fractional ownership can be a good option to consider advantages of fractional properties are the lower minimum investment starting at
