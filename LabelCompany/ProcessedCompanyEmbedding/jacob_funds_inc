information investment process performance holdings sectors the portfolio managers follow a threestep process to identify and monitor the funds investments find the first step in our investment process is to narrow down the seemingly infinite universe of possibilities and to focus on what we feel are the most attractive opportunities accomplishing this step is no easy task it requires countless hours of research  scouring the web reading analyst reports running quantitative screens attending conferences speaking to executives  all in an attempt to find those relatively rare nuggets worth looking into more closely sometimes those nuggets are individual companies and sometimes they are broader themes that can open up a wide range of potential investments filter once we find an intriguing investment idea we then deploy a thorough qualitative and quantitative review process to determine if the opportunity is as attractive as it appears and can be had at a fair price very few of our ideas that we uncover end up being part of our concentrated portfolios ideally we are looking for companies that play in large markets in which there are significant barriers to entry enjoy what we believe is a strong competitive position with growing market share and boast capable management teams with proven track records we want the companies to have unique assets  such as proprietary technologies or unusually loyal customers  with the possibility that positive nearterm catalysts could drive the value of our investment higher if everything looks good qualitatively we turn our focus to valuation we evaluate many different quantitative criteria including cash flows income statement and balance sheet items we determine what a company is likely to generate in sales and profits for the coming years and then using several different metrics calculate a fair valuation based on those estimates of course we also consider the biggest risks to each companys outlook and gauge the likelihood that these potential pitfalls could derail the investment thesis followup once we add an investment to one of our portfolios we continue to monitor the position closely making sure that our original analysis remains valid we will often rebalance or potentially exit a position if the riskreward ratio for the investment changes materially we also conduct detailed portfolio reviews on a regular basis there are specific risks inherent in investing in the internet area particularly with respect to smaller capitalized companies and the high volatility of internet stocks investments in
