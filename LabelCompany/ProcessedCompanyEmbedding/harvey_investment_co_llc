align with your goals step  where am i today its difficult to plan for the future without an understanding of where you stand today this means identifying and prioritizing your needs assessing your tolerance for risk and understanding what impacts your current financial picture – things like income expenses and any savings talking about these factors helps shape the advice your financial advisor can offer and the strategy youll build together to get you where you want to go step  where would i like to be after determining where you are today the next step is identifying where youd like to be what does your vision for the future look like what are you trying to accomplish this discussion is very important your financial advisor will use this information and our tools to translate your vision into a personal measurable goal and to develop a written strategy to track your progress step  can i get there this is where the rubber meets the road you know where you stand what you want to

centerrtriflimited liability companyrtriffaq limited liability company faq find faqs related to starting an llc what is a limited liability company llc a limited liability company or llc is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are not personally liable for business debts like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc has operating flexibility and is a passthrough entity for tax purposes this means the llcs profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the llc what legal documents do i need to form an llc to create an llc articles of organization must be filed with the secretary of state or appropriate state agency next the llc members should enter into an operating agreement which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company an llc may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the irs legalzoom can prepare all of the required documents for you can my llc have an unlimited lifespan yes recent changes to the irs code have promoted changes in state laws permitting llcs to be created with an unlimited life what is the difference between a member and a manager of an llc a member is an owner of the llc and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation a manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the llc and is similar to a director of a corporation a manager can also be a member does an llc have to hold meetings the answer is usually no unless the llcs operating agreement requires meetings legalzooms operating agreements make meetings optional this is one of the key advantages of an llc  fewer formalities this means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection how much will it cost to form and operate an llc each state charges an annual fee to maintain an llc in many states you must also submit an

contact us corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical

commentary• our mission and philosophy we believe that there is an investment discipline which leaves wide open the opportunity for the tremendous financial benefits of common stock ownership and which also meaningfully reduces the risk of the substantial permanent losses that are often associated with investment in the stock market the holy grail for investors is more reward and less risk the approach that offers this is easy to describe and understand but the skills required to execute it effectively are won only with the guidance of extraordinary mentors and years of hard experience we have practiced this approach for more than three decades and have observed its successful application by like minded investors as well we believe strongly that a firm should exist in our community that offers this approach in its pure form we provide it our investment philosophy is based on the concept that the expected cash flows to owners of stocks and bonds create a core value that is independent from the quoted market price of such assets because markets are emotional buying opportunities arise when assets are priced far below their core value and selling opportunities appear when assets are priced far above their core value if we are accurate in our assessment of core value and diligent in executing our strategies we should provide better than average profits with meaningfully

approaching your needs together before we can develop an investment strategy for you we get to know you why are you investing what do you want to do this is your financial future it shouldnt be left to chance or some offtheshelf plan the approach we work through together should be as individual as you are when you partner with an edward jones financial advisor we follow an established process that starts with asking whats important to you and then we listen really listen after we understand whats important to you and why together we build a strategy tailored just for you based on your financial needs to work toward achieving your goals by working through the edward jones step asset management process with you your local financial advisor can help assess your tolerance for risk create a quantifiable actionable financial goal based on whats important to you recommend investments and strategies that support and align with your goals step  where am i today its difficult to plan for the future without an understanding of where you stand today this means identifying and prioritizing your needs assessing your tolerance for risk and understanding what impacts your current financial picture – things like income expenses and any savings talking about these factors helps shape the advice your financial advisor can offer and the strategy youll build together to get you where you want to go step  where would i like to be after determining where you are today the next step is identifying where youd like to be what does your vision for the future look like what are you trying to accomplish this discussion is very important your financial advisor will use this information and our tools to translate your vision into a personal measurable goal and to develop a written strategy to track your progress step  can i get there this is where the rubber meets the road you know where you stand what you want to do in the future and how much risk youre comfortable taking to get there your financial advisor can now help you answer the big question can i get there together youll analyze what youre currently doing and discuss any adjustments you can make to better position you to achieve your goals step  how do i get there discussing the first three steps allows your financial advisor to understand your complete financial picture – your needs attitude toward risk progress toward your goal and current investment strategy taking these factors into consideration along with our firms investment principles your financial advisor can identify the most appropriate investments protection and services to get you where you want to be its also important that you understand and are comfortable with the fees that come along with these investments and services thats why your financial advisor will walk you through the costs involved before you implement these recommendations step  how can i stay on track the last step may be one of the most important after building a solid strategy well work together to make sure you stay on track this is more than just what we do in the office – its about regularly checking in about questions you have or changes in your life or the market that may affect your current path putting your team in place we believe that when it comes to financial matters the value of professional advice cannot be overestimated depending on whats important to you and the strategies you put into place it may make sense to bring your legal and tax professionals into this process your financial advisor will work in partnership with the other key members of your team – like your cpa or attorney and the  associates at our home office – as needed to help achieve your success how we can help starting this process is as simple as answering a few questions to help determine whats important to you get started today by contacting your local financial advisor your financial advisor  contact me not my financial advisor set as my
