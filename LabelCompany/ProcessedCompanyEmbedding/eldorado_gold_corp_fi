sites development projects and exploration projects   greece in the halkidiki district a  metre drilling program continued during the quarter at the piavitsa deposit which is located  kilometres west of the stratoni project this program consists largely of infill drillholes designed to confirm the continuity of mineralization delineated in widelyspaced drillholes drilled during  and  results to date showed grades and thicknesses in general agreement with the resource model            management’s discussion and analysis for the three and ninemonth periods ended september      at the stratoni mine stepout drilling targeted the western and downdip extensions of the orebody the best results were obtained from just below the current production levels where thick massive sulfide intercepts indicate downdip continuity of the orebody   in the perama  sapes district exploration activities during the quarter focused on updating the geological model for the sapes deposit for the purposes of refining the resource model and identifying exploration drilling targets   romania in the certej project area exploration drilling during the quarter tested satellite targets at magura and bocsa both of which were sites of historical underground exploration no significant results were obtained from the first three drillholes on these targets these prospects will be further tested during the fourth quarter upon receipt of required drilling permits   at muncel located  kilometres southwest of certej the final three drillholes of the first phase of exploration drilling were completed one of these was abandoned after intersecting underground workings while the other two cut weak to moderate zones of sulfide stringer veinlets   the certej deposit is currently the subject of a detailed geological reinterpretation program which will be completed in the fourth quarter with updated deposit geology and resource models   turkey exploration drilling during the quarter in turkey was limited to the efemcukuru project where  metres of drilling tested the dedebag vein system and segments of the kokarpinar vein the best results were obtained from the central and northern portions of the kokarpinar vein where several metres of sulfiderich rhodochrosite vein intercepts of several metres width were obtained   reconnaissance exploration activities included mapping and sampling of volcanic centres in the greater kisladag region to evaluate potential for buried porphyry systems and evaluations of regional prospects in the northern part of the country   china at tanjianshan drilling programs were completed at the dushugou prospect and at the qinlongtan “qlt” deposit at qlt drilling confirmed the continuity of the qlt northwest zone in the previously untested gap between the  drillholes and the qlt open pit   exploration drilling at the white mountain mine  metres completed tested stepouts alongstrike and downplunge from the ore body mining grades and thicknesses were confirmed in five separate areas with highest grades encountered in the north and north deep ore zones surface drilling of the north deep zone also commenced during the quarter   brazil exploration drilling during the quarter in brazil tested two projects in the tapajos region at the ruben zilio project located along strike southeast of tocantinzinho soil geochemical anomalies were tested in three target areas none of this drilling identified significant mineralization at tocantinzinho additional sampling extended the cumoau mineralization over a  km trend four drillholes tested different areas of this anomaly
