francescas holdings fran john n lenz contrarian longshort equity longterm horizon deep valuelinkedinsummarygrowth story still intactcompany making strategic investments including a shift towards ecommerce distributionearnings and margin concerns more than priced invaluation looks favorable and shares are undervaluedinvestment thesis francescas holdings corporation nasdaqfran is a boutique retail chain selling apparel jewelry accessories and gift items in recent quarters the company’s stock has taken a significant hit due to margin deterioration persistent negative sentiment and price action surrounding the stock due to margin pressures have been overdone despite the firm’s recent margin pressures francescas still boasts higher margins and better financial and operational performance than its peers at this point the firm’s margin pressures are likely fully reflected in its stock price however its growing ecommerce division is being overlooked in terms of valuation with ecommerce beginning to pick up speed and valuation pricing in significant downside of the shares i suggest the firm is an attractive pick with an asymmetrical payoff profile i therefore recommend a buy on francesca’s holdings corporation with a target price of  company and business model overview primary operating segments  breakdown  apparel    jewelry    accessories    gifts   francesca’s holdings corporation an operator of boutiques sells apparel jewelry gifts and accessories primarily designed for teens and young women between the ages of  and  years old in  francesca’s managed to grow overall topline sales at a  growth rate despite a tough retail environment most of the firm’s topline growth originates from its investment in growing its base of existing boutique stores this growth was despite yearyear declines in overall foot traffic francesca’s holdings corporation continues to grow its base of existing boutique stores at a rate of approximately  per year the company funds this expansion internally out of its operating cash flows recouping its original investment in new boutiques within  months moreover the firm continues to grow by transitioning a portion of its business to ecommerce in order to diversify its revenue streams as well as counteract the decreases in foot traffic that have afflicted the entire retail segment the ecommerce portion of the business has experienced substantial growth in recent years growing from less than  to about  of the firm’s sales over the last five years in  francesca’s grew its overall ecommerce online business by  yearyear and the firm’s ecommerce business now represents approximately  of its net sales for  superior samestore sales growth relative to peers the stocks current valuation indicates a worst case scenario of declining samestore sales growth the firms samestore sales growth while flat has been superior to its peers due to the companys corporate strategy of maintaining limited quantities of a broad assortment of merchandise it does this by regularly making smaller more frequent vendor shipments than peers this strategy helps the firm to effectively compete with other retail establishments by consistently bringing new merchandise into the store this strategy has a few benefits firstly it creates a more personalized and fresh shopping experience which translates into improved customer service and increased store traffic as customers check stores more often when they see new merchandise while shopping customers are more likely to make impulse purchases thus increasing average transactions relative to peers the strategy also has the associated benefit of managing the risk of inventory obsolescence by maintaining limited quantities of a wide assortment of brands the firm therefore benefits from the availability of a wide assortment of products without the associated risk of too much inventory despite flat samestore sales growth the firms current expansion can still be justified on the basis of increased economies of scale and improvements in purchasing power while i cannot say for sure that samestore sales growth will not go negative i can confidently state that samestore sales growth has been superior to other industry peers and i believe the firms broad and narrow inventory strategy provides the necessary competitive advantage to maintain this edge going forward earnings and margin concerns are overblown the prevailing negative sentiment and price action surrounding the stock appear to be due to higher selling general and administration expenses and lackluster samestore sales growth similar to other industry peers although the firm’s gross and operating margins have deteriorated in the recent year margins appear to be stabilizing with margins mostly flat over the recent year furthermore despite the deterioration in the firm’s gross and operating margins the firm still boasts margins superior to its overall industry peer group while samestore sales growth has been flat revenues have grown at a rate of approximately  per year due to expansions in the company’s base of boutiques francesca’s holdings corporation currently operates a base of  stores with a longterm goal of opening a total of  boutique stores across the country given the firm’s goal of expanding its store base to  growth in new boutique openings is likely to trail off as the company approaches its goal i believe the firm’s rapidly growing ecommerce divisions will replace this source of revenue growth a view that is bolstered by the firm’s continued reinvestment of cash flows into this burgeoning division at this point earnings and margin concerns are more than priced into the stock price moreover the company’s management is returning capital to its shareholder via share buybacks shrinking its share count in the most recent year by approximately  this indicates management’s confidence in that its shares are undervalued and better days lay ahead for the firm ecommerce will drive future growth opportunities francesca’s holdings corporation has grown its ecommerce portion of the business at about a  compounded annual growth the last few years and ecommerce now represent  of all sales furthermore while management does not disclose the average transaction amount the firm indicates in its  quarter  conference call that average transactions are substantially greater for the ecommerce portion of the business than for brick and mortar boutique stores management plans to grow its ecommerce penetration as a percentage of revenue to the low to midteens in the next  years while this certainly seems like a lofty goal the firm’s own marketing research has shown a lack of awareness of its ecommerce distribution system by its existing customer base management is currently undertaking an advertising and promotional campaign to increase awareness of the online distribution system by the existing customer base this indicates significant room to improve market penetration of the ecommerce business and thereby drive future growth opportunities once new boutique openings have slowed solid financial and operating performance performance metric     asset turnover     gross margin     operating margin     net margin     return on assets     the company generates a high return on equity making up the lower margins attributable to the industry and market structure through the use of superior asset efficiency the company’s lack of leverage improves the firm’s ability to continue its growth with lower risk despite the recent weakness in retail the firm has continued to generate outstanding returns on equity in excess of  this is predominantly due to the firm’s ability to effectively manage its assets given its commendable total asset turnover of x the firm’s broad but shallow merchandising strategy continues to pay off with exceptional inventory turnover francesca’s holdings corporation maintains limited quantities of a broad assortment of products helping the company to manage markdowns and inventory obsolescence risks related to the fashion and retail environment while benefiting from the brand’s perception of exclusivity this strategy also has the associated benefit of constantly bringing new merchandise into the store which drives foot traffic and increases brand loyalty additionally management is currently conducting market research in preparation of the release of a new customer loyalty program which should further boost brand loyalty and enable an expansion in margins looking forward i expect asset and inventory turnover to be bolstered by recent investments in an inventory ordering system the new inventory system should reduce lead time allowing francesca’s to turn its inventory and assets even more efficiently and thereby continue to boost its return on equity moreover the firm has managed to retain respectable margins superior to its peer group even in the wake of continuing retail weakness i expect margins to continue to remain flat however i cannot rule out the possibility of additional margin deterioration should industry conditions worsen in the long term the firm may not possess a significant amount of operational leverage but it likely has the ability to demand lower rental prices and possibly reduced vendor prices as it continues to scale once the existing leases expire francesca’s holdings corporation and all its new boutiques will likely be able to renew these leases and benefit from more favorable rental prices due to being an anchor tenant on the other hand a worsening retail environment could also adversely affect margins due to competitive pressures and increased merchandise markdowns the firm’s ability to finance its operations without the use of any debt significantly reduces downside risk in this scenario by improving the firm’s operating flexibility given the weak retail environment valuation bear case in the bear case a declining retail environment will inhibit the firm from generating a return on capital necessary to cover its cost of capital in this event the firm is likely to begin becoming an income investment stock as companies that are unable to generate an economic profit are best served returning capital to their shareholders through buybacks and dividends the firm’s current strategy of executing a significant buyback program bears this out if the firm becomes a dividend paying stock the firm is likely to pay out approximately  of its earnings to its shareholders since reinvestment into the business would no longer be economically feasible the valuation of the business would then be equal to the firm’s dividends paid out plus the firm’s value of net cash i also believe it to be a fair assumption for the firm to be able to grow its dividends and sales at a rate of  as greater cost efficiencies occur traditionally as sales growth begins to slow for firms companies begin to cut costs to create a leaner operating structure i believe the firm can maintain consistent  increases in average selling prices in line with expense and inflation growth given its strong brand loyalty furthermore i believe the firm also has the ability to drive some cost efficiencies in its operating structure by reducing marketing costs and reducing pay for performance and sales commissions for example a nogrowth version of the business will not have to spend money on these costs and therefore opportunities exist for driving greater cost efficiencies we can value this nogrowth valuation of the firm as the value of its future dividends using the gordon growth model plus the amount of net cash per share for shareholders dividend discount model components model assumptions and outputs

assumptions estimated riskfree rate   year beta  market risk premiumhistorical  weighted average cost of capital wacc  the most likely case in the most likely case i believe the firm will continue to grow its sales in line with its historical compounded annual growth rate and margins will likely remain flat furthermore i also believe that the although samestore sales growth will continue to be flat the firm’s continued investment in its ecommerce distribution channel will pay dividends as ecommerce sales become a more meaningful portion of the business investors have not priced in any growth from the ecommerce shift but as ecommerce continues to grow as a proportion of sales i believe the visibility of this ecommerce division will improve and investors eventually will price this with a significantly higher multiple the fact that market research indicates limited awareness of the ecommerce channel by the company’s existing customer base bolsters my confidence in management’s online strategic initiatives the company currently sells for a bargain price of x  free cash flow along with the a free cash flow yield of approximately  one of the firm’s primary competitors nordstrom nysejwn which sells its own private brands and operates within the accessories and apparel lines of business sells at x its  free cash flow despite selling at a premium to francesca’s holdings corporation nordstrom lags the firm in both its margins and returns on assets furthermore its overall peer group sells at an industry median of x  free cash flows and as shown below francesca’s holdings corporation is clearly a superior performer to its peer group and thus should sell at a premium to its industry given this i believe that once investors notice the emerging ecommerce business and it becomes a more meaningful portion of the firm’s revenue over the next few years the market will rerate the stock and a comparable x free cash flow multiple would be a quite reasonable valuation assuming no growth in the firm’s free cash flows applying a conservative x free cash flow multiple to the stock on par with the multiple of its peer group yields a price target of  indicating a margin of safety and a  upside potential this implied multiple likely understates actual upside potential due to its lack of inclusion of any growth in free cash flows as the firm’s rate

fcfshare  intrinsic valuation given a pfcf multiple of x  ocf  capex   fcf  conclusions there are definitely risks to the growth story and the company in particular however given the valuation the growth story has been considerably derisked if management is able to execute its strategic goals and navigate a successful shift towards a bigger ecommerce division the market will eventually notice and significant upside potential exists if i am wrong and the firm’s expansion into ecommerce falters i believe the stock has more than priced in the downside risk since even if the firm is unable to grow further and becomes a dividend paying stock its current valuation implies a  downside this is balanced against an upside potential of approximately  in the event of a modest rerating of valuation

eps consensus was  cents sales eked out a  increase to  million from  million but short of a consensus of  million improved sales in april failed to compensate for weak numbers in february and march samestore sales declined  driven by a decline in boutique traffic and conversion rates estimates were for only a  decline houston texasbased francesca’s caters to  yearold fashion conscious female customers in what has become a familiar refrain during the current earnings season in the retailing sector management pointed to the onetwo punch of lower traffic and a later easter this year “we were disappointed in our comparable sales performance which was impacted by lower than expected boutique traffic and conversion rate” steve lawrence president and ceo said in a company press release “february and march sales were soft primarily as a result of the later easter driving weaker than anticipated sales in fullprice product in spite of lower sales our first quarter diluted eps came in at the low end of our guidance due to better than expected merchandise margins and cost management since the beginning of april sales trends have improved with the onset of warmer weather and the easter shift” as  john jagerson editor of slingshot trader wrote here last week “investors care about retail spending because most of us gross domestic product is derived through consumption consumer spending is a measure of economic health and corporate profits a decline in the growth rate of consumer spending or even a contraction is a precursor to recessions for those reasons the declines in some big retail stocks has put traders on edge this quarter” sales are now expected to be in a range of  million to  million for fiscal q compared to a consensus forecast of  million while samestore

holdings  an attractive long in a depressed industryapr  about francescas holdings fran kenra investors value longterm horizon research analyst contrarianmarketplaceconsumer alphasummarythe apparel industry in the united states has not performed very well in the last  yearsfrancescas holdings is one of the few exceptions reporting solid growth on all frontsat less than  times earnings the stock is a good longfrancescas holdings nasdaqfran is one of the few apparel retailers that has been able to report solid growth numbers in the last  years the company operates a flexible business model based on relatively small boutiques and a fast growing commerce website growth is not expected to fade away soon and balance sheet is strong at less than  times earnings i think the stock is an attractive long business overview francescas holdings is a specialty retailer that operates a chain of boutiques across the united states as of january  most recent available data the company operates  boutiques in  states and the district of columbia through which it offers a mix of apparel jewelry accessories and gifts mainly targeted towards women between the ages of  francescas holdings also operates a fastgrowing ecommerce business through its website wwwfrancescascom although their business model is nothing particularly unique or innovative the company is not the usual apparel retailer the companys stores range in size from  to  square feet with an average size of  square feet much less than standard specialty retailers nonetheless francescas stores tend to have more flexible formats with the aim of securing highly visible locations in malls street locations lifestyle centers strip centers and outlet centers the company tries to make each store feel like an independently owned boutique rather than a homogeneous chain moreover each store carries a relatively limited number of items and brings new items often  days a week according to management to create a feeling of scarcity and uniqueness of the goods it sells and to keep the shopping experience fresh and interesting these stores primarily offer a unique assortment which primarily consists of exclusive items under the companys proprietary brands with the addition of a small selection of a few nationallyrecognized brands in some categories an exception in the retail space the business model is simple the growth model is even simpler francescas growth model largely depends on the opening of new boutiques each year and on growth in the ecommerce channel so far its working pretty well revenue has grown for years although with some volatility in the growth rate supported by rising comps growth in the ecommerce business and an increasing number of boutiques even in the recent quarters which have been characterized by an extremely weak retail environment the company has continued to report positive growth francescas has been one of the few apparel retailers reporting positive revenue growth and comps in  although comps were flat in q fran data by ycharts this retailer has held up well in a difficult  and  in part delivering positive revenue growth and flat comps even in its worst quarter while many retailers were dealing with significant declines sometimes in excess of  when we analyze the state of retail and apparel retail in particular francescas seems to be a nice exception in a depressed industry its not easy to indicate a reason behind the relative strength probably the company has positioned itself on the right side of current fashion trends or maybe their continuous renewal in offerings has created a nice shopping experience that customers like to repeat it could also be that their flexible store format let them exploit a variety of geographies with different characteristics and demographic trends nonetheless  of their boutiques are located in malls so they were not immune to the effects of declining foot traffic in that segment the relative strength is surely due to a combination of factors but whats interesting for me is the fact that the company can attract consumers and the brand is gaining popularity how do i know it besides the clear expansion shown in reported numbers our friend google trends helps us  as we can see in the chart the interest for francescas is booming valuation what multiple would you give the stock of a growing company that has been one of the few good performers in a depressed industry if your answer is something like a multiple that implies a premium over the worse performing peers i totally agree with you although the market doesnt comparing fran to similar stocks in the apparel industry its strange to see that its relatively easy to trade at a premium over fran even for companies with lower margins and revenue growth revenue growth and margins fran revenue quarterly yoy growth data by ycharts price to earnings multiples fran pe ratio ttm data by ycharts i also find it strange that the stock can trade at a pe multiple below  while the median for the industry is more than  higher at  i think there is not much to justify the difference even if we assume that the market is giving a premium to bigger companies due to their scale advantage or brand power i think this is still a low valuation for a growing company in this market takeaway and risks francescas holdings is a nice company they have a flexible business model and very good margins and growth compared to the rest of the industry the stock is trading at an attractive valuation considering the companys performance the companys growth is being driven by three main positive trends  a growing number of stores a growing ecommerce business and rising comps only comps have slowed down in the last few quarters while ecommerce growth has accelerated and the number of boutiques keeps rising store count has grown at a  cagr in the last  years and management expects a  increase in   more boutiques ecommerce is growing in excess of  while comps were flat in q but are not expected to decline for  francescas management expects a  to  revenue increase over last year and a  eps growth from  to  if growth doesnt fall short of expectations the current price is an interesting entry point the risks of this investment are basically the same of any apparelfashion stock the company operates in a fragmented and competitive market which is subject to changing trends that may occasionally help or threaten one company or another an import tax under the current government could harm the business profitability but besides that i dont see particularly high risks the company has a solid balance sheet and its biggest supplier accounts for just  of the products sold i am long with a  year horizon thanks for taking the time
