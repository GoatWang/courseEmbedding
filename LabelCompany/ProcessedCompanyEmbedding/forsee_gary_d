combo phones come to market in the united states linking conventional wireless service and lowpriced internet calling and given the likelihood cable television companies such as comcast corp and time warner inc will be among the first to roll them out the phones will probably include movie trailers and television clips delivered to the wireless handset forsee said at the boston college chief

and research cathy minehan president federal reserve bank of boston and gary forsee chat before lunch companies including motorola inc and cisco systems inc have developed prototypes which are essentially standard cell phones that become cordless phones for supercheap internetbased phone service once they are in the range of a wifi wireless fidelity transmitter two key issues still being worked out are how to ensure callers can move without interruption between the two modes and more important whether cellular carriers will reject the technology as a threat to their profits because it lets customers switch from wireless minutes to cheap unlimited internet calling time warner this week confirmed it is using sprint to provide a trial wireless service bundled with cable tv highspeed

than  cable phone customers already because the two biggest wireless companies cingular and verizon are both owned by baby bell phone companies that are archrivals of cable cable companies are expected to look chiefly to sprint for wireless and landline telecom services comcast and cox communications inc were also key financial backers of sprint in the s sprint hopes late this year to close

overland park kansas  httpwwwsprintcom ■ until  gary d forsee was an obscure figure a civil engineer by training who had worked his way up the corporate ladder at southwestern bell and its parent company american telephone and telegraph att in  he accepted a job at sprint that precipitated the first of the court cases that may represent forsees broadest and longestlasting influence on american businesses influencing the way millions of employment contracts would be written and interpreted his shift from global one to bellsouth in  set further gary d forsee apwide world photos  precedents and his spectacular move from bellsouth back to sprint had a broad effect on the relationships between contractual employees and their companies during the s forsee established a reputation as a solid leader who could navigate businesses through thorny alliances he became one of the most soughtafter executives in the telecommunications industry because he had experience in every facet of the business and understood the relationships among wireless and wireline communications datadriven communications such as the internet and voicedriven communication and video and audio technologies further he was sharpminded with superb skills for dealing with people the combination of forsees wideranging knowledge and management skills made him the object of battles between giant corporations with billions of dollars at stake in  these circumstances resulted in forsees being in a position to engineer a radical restructuring of sprint perhaps creating a new corporate model for stcentury service industries corporate fires when forsee graduated from college with a degree in civil engineering in  he joined southwestern bell part of att he worked in various offices of att mostly in new jersey and washington dc records of his early years at att are scant but possibly it was while working in new jersey and washington that he began to develop the homesickness for kansas city that would later affect some of the most important decisions of his career in  forsee was appointed vice president for service operations for att where his steady personality and extensive knowledge of telecommunications operations could help att develop a good reputation for serving customers when the us government decided to reorganize all of its communications systems to prepare the country for stcentury technology att was one of the winning bidders on the lucrative contract with sprint being the other the two companies were expected to work together on the project dubbed fts  the bitterness of joining sprint part  sprint had its headquarters in overland park kansas near kansas city missouri and a desire to return to his hometown may have motivated forsee to take a job in december  directing sprints half of the fts  program he was named general manager and vice president of sprints government systems division att sued forsee and sprint claiming that forsee had proprietary information belonging to att and citing a noncompete clause in forsees contract with att that forbade his working for a competitor of the company michael schlanger of the king  spalding law firm represented forsee in a state court in alexandria virginia it was obvious that what forsee knew about atts work on fts  would be applied to his work on sprints fts  but this appeared to benefit both att and sprint because he would be in a position to help the companies coordinate their efforts noncompete clauses were common in employee contracts especially in the telecommunications industry where a competitive edge could mean millions of dollars in revenue yet schlanger and forsee successfully argued that the noncompete wording in forsees contract was too restrictive and in  the court allowed forsee to join sprint the ruling was a blow to the noncompete clause tradition in corporate law from february  to february  forsee served as president of both the government systems division and the business services division of sprint in march  he was named president and chief operating officer of sprints longdistance services also that year he was appointed to the board of trustees of the march of dimes a volunteer position as chief operating officer of longdistance services forsee revealed a flair for creativity as well as for making canny decisions from  to  sprints longdistance services revenues grew  percent to  billion thanks partly to marketing and pricing strategies such as the fridays free program for business customers global one in february  forsee was named president and chief executive officer of global one a joint venture of deutsche telekom france telecom and sprint the companies had founded global one in january  with each owning onethird of the joint venture the object of global one was to offer companies doing international business a unified source for all of their communications needs simplifying customers international communications and saving them money in  global one had  billion in revenues but lost money it fell behind its earning schedule making sprint in particular impatient when the projection for global ones making a profit was moved back by two years forsee was chosen in  to replace the former president and ceo forsee was responsible for both finances and operations for a venture that had  business customers and  employees scattered through numerous outlets in  countries deutsche telekom tried to buy italy telecom which miffed france telecom whose management perhaps thought deutsche telekom was breaking the trust of the partners in global one by trying to offer international services on its own the two companies bickering placed forsee in the difficult situation of keeping the disagreement from breaking up global one while he tried to meet sprints demands that the young venture start making profits soon further he seemed to have been unhappy with working in brussels belgium where global one had its headquarters in july  he resigned from global one bellsouth in september  bellsouth corporation hired forsee as executive vice president and chief staff officer bellsouth headquartered in atlanta was a company on the rise its ambitious chairman of the board duane ackerman was expanding operations throughout the world forsee had the demanding responsibilities for all employee governance and for bellsouths domestic operations his contract with sprint contained a noncompete clause but sprint took the high road and agreed to release him when bellsouth promised that forsee would not at least at first work in bellsouths longdistance operations even so it seems to have been understood by all parties that forsee would eventually help bellsouth with its broadband and longdistance operations forsee impressed his coworkers with his quick mind and his careful managing of people and he was very well liked he worked on wireline and wireless communications on cable television digital television the internet other datatransmission services marketing and the yellow pages in  bellsouth tried to buy sprint only to have worldcom intrude near the end of negotiations with a higher bid killing what would have been a billion merger in  government antitrust regulators disallowed worldcoms purchase of sprint in september  bellsouth made forsee president of bellsouth international at the time bellsouth had  million customers in  countries and was forming ambitious alliances with regional companies especially in latin america where business was burgeoning in may  bellsouth allied with central americas starmedia to expand wireless communications in latin america the number of wireless users in the region was growing by  percent per year in november  bellsouth restructured its organization to put wholesale and retail operations into domestic operations under forsee who became vice chairman of the board for bellsouth on january   after the previous vice chairman jere drummond retired on december   therein may have been the seeds of the great corporate struggle that was played out on a world stage in early  when forsee became vice chairman outsiders assumed it meant that he was ackermans heir to become chairman of the board when ackerman retired certainly forsees responsibilities showed a great deal of trust on the part of ackerman and the board of directors who gave forsee not only drummonds responsibilities but also those of the retiring president of network services charlie coe however forsee had the example before him of the vice chairman drummond another heir apparent who never got the chairmanship moreoever ackermans contract ran to at least  perhaps  the position of vice chairman could have been as far up bellsouths corporate ladder as forsee would go forsee had plenty of work to do he dealt with government regulations marketing bellsouths wireline and wireless networks external affairs and the yellow pages in  bellsouth had  digital subscriber line dsl customers and  percent of its lines were ready for dsl but this percentage had to improve the company had  employees and  billion in revenue forsee coordinated the demands of dsl and other new technologies the employees and the revenues he was well compensated for this earning  million in salary bonuses and stock benefits for the year then in december  sprint offered its positions of ceo and chairman of the board to forsee on the one hand forsee had been given a great deal of trust at bellsouth where he was admired on the other sprint offered him its top two jobs now rather than later and he would return to his hometown of kansas city if he rejoined sprint where he knew most of the management he asserted in court documents that his principal reason for wishing to rejoin sprint was that he would be going home and there is no reason not to believe that this was in fact his foremost motivation the press found out about the job offer before ackerman did forsee did not tell ackerman of the offer until january   on january  ackerman and bellsouths board of directors offered forsee more money and more responsibility if he would remain with bellsouth on january  with forsee trying to call ackerman throughout the day but not reaching him bellsouth obtained a restraining order probably after  pm against forsee cingular a wireless joint venture between bellsouth and sbc soon joined a lawsuit against forsee and sprint on february   a restraining order was issued against forsee and sprint the bitterness of joining sprint part  sprint was in a difficult situation in late  its ambitions for expansion into world markets had crashed it laid off  employees worldwide from october  to february  in december  alone it cut  jobs  percent of its remaining workforce on february   the wall street journal reported tax troubles for the companys ceo and chairman of the board william t esrey and its president and chief operating officer ronald lemay although they had both set up tax shelters recommended by sprints auditors ernst  young the internal revenue service was auditing the  and  tax returns for both men ordinarily the company and its officers would have weathered the bad news taking no action until the government declared its conclusions but recent scandals at enron and other corporations made sprint wary of how the news would affect its customers it was a public relations nightmare even if the irs exonerated esrey and lemay further esrey had lymphatic cancer and was undergoing treatment forsee may have looked like a godsend to sprints board of directors he was regarded as thoroughly ethical he knew most of sprints operations and he had a reputation for making good decisions getting even the most trying ones right his patience with people would be valuable in a corporation stressed by falling sales and job losses sprint also held attractions for forsee besides returning to his home working with people he knew and liked and holding the top positions at a telecommunications giant sprint with  million customers in  countries and  billion in revenue for  offered him a great challenge and considerable power in its lawsuit bellsouth cited a restrictive covenant in its contract with forsee meaning a noncompete clause that forbade him to take a position with a competitor for  months after leaving bellsouths employment bellsouth also cited a confidentiality clause the georgia trade secrets act and the doctrine of inevitable disclosure which meant that forsee would inevitably use bellsouths trade secrets if he worked for sprint because the two had very similar markets it would be like the ceo of cocacola defecting to pepsico taking with him the companys marketing strategies and secret product formula asserted bellsouths february  filing with the court  lawcom  march   it was bellsouths contention that forsee knew all of bellsouths plans for the next three years and could damage the company by taking advantage of this knowledge on behalf of sprint during the period of restraining orders and court appearances bellsouth continued to pay forsees high salary and may even have hoped he would continue to work for the company king  spalding which had represented forsee in – when att sued him had drafted forsees bellsouth contract in january  king  spalding joined with the sonnenschein law firm to represent forsee with michael schlanger as forsees lead lawyer bellsouths lawyers tried to have both schlanger and king  spalding barred from the case because of a conflict of interest but their efforts were denied by then the case was being covered in media around the world and in america it had broad implications for employment contracts could employers insist that employees restrict their job options cases for lesser lights had generally gone in favor of employers and the noncompete clauses the case was argued in fulton county georgia superior court before judge stephanie b manis sprints senior vice president liane pelletier filed an affidavit with the court arguing that government regulation of the telecommunications industry was so great requiring so much disclosure that there really were few actual trade secrets although it was a thin argument it touched on an aspect of bellsouths claims that seemed to backfire the inevitable disclosure doctrine georgias constitution forbade restraint of trade indeed geogias righttowork laws were second in strength only to californias if the disclosure was inevitable then the confidentiality aspect of bellsouths argument equated to preventing forsee from practicing his trade with any company meaning he could not find work forsees lawyers contended that bellsouths arguments meant he could not work in at least  states and  foreign countries more telling was the argument against the noncompete clause preventing forsee to work for any competitor of bellsouths for  months the clause was too broad and too vague insisted forsees lawyers on february   judge manis struck down the noncompete restrictions in forsees bellsouth contract she called the geographical restrictions unenforceable said that other restrictions were unreasonable because they prevented forsee from pursuing too wide a range of types of jobs and declared the noncompete clause too restrictive too broad too vague and void thus in  and  forsee dealt two telling blows to employment restrictions in contracts the implications extended far beyond virginia and georgia noncompete clauses could be too restrictive broad and vague and could prove to be unenforceable anywhere in the united states a standard clause that was routinely used to intimidate employees became of dubious legality because of the awareness to its unfairness brought by forsees cases judge manis ordered forsee and bellsouth to go to arbitration for no more than  days on aspects of the confidentiality issues bellsouth appealed judge maniss ruling to the georgia supreme court but the appeal was rejected in march  an arbitration hearing was held before judge william h webster former head of the fbi and the cia the court order allowed webster to consider only the confidentiality and tradesecrets clauses of the contract on march   judge webster made his decision declaring that from march   to march   forsee could not lobby for sprint in areas where bellsouth had business could not participate in decisions about marketing that competed with bellsouth and cingular and could not participate in acquisition and merger discussions sprints board of directors was required by judge webster to acknowledge the restrictions placed on forsee for the oneyear period apparently forsee abided by the spirit as well as the letter of websters decision and it seems that he never gave away bellsouths confidences on march   forsee became ceo of sprint and joined its board of directors he did not attend board meetings when restricted subjects were discussed esrey and lemay remained with sprint to help with the transition of authority leaving on may   when forsee became chairman of the board he created a national strategy for sprint that emphasized bundling all of sprints resources into packages customers could purchase with bundles tailored to suit specific kinds of customers and he directed the simplifying of the process by which customers ordered services in september  international business machines corporation and sprint formed an alliance to consolidate customer service saving sprint hundreds of millions of dollars per year and forsee reorganized sprint into two groups business customers and general consumers in january  sprint allied with samsung sanyo toshiba and realnetworks to offer d games on cell phones enable customers to download television clips and provide both voice and data services over multiple platforms in april  sprint combined its fon and pcs wireless stocks exchanging onehalf fon stock for one pcs stock in an effort to make sprint stock easier to understand see also entries on att corp bellsouth corporation and sprint communications company lp in international directory of company histories  sources for further

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
