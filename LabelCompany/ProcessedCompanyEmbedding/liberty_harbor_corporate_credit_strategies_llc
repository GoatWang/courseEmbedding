intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × goldman sachs is going to start a new type of fund for its rich clients john carney netnet apr  0 0 am 0 facebook linkedin twitter email print jemal countessgetty images its official goldman sachs has inaugurated the second stage of wall streets development after doddfrank and the volcker rule the first postreform stage was the transformation of proprietary trading units into marketmaking trading units before volcker wall street firms risked their own capital trading securities with counterparties after volcker wall street firms risked their own capital trading securities in anticipation and reaction to customer order flow the old way was to ask how can we make money by reacting to market events the new way is to ask how can we make money by reacting to customer reactions to market events see the difference in the old way you had counterparties in the new way you focus on customers and those two words — counterparty and customer — are totally spelled differently despite beginning with the same letter officially this was the getting rid of things we arent allowed to have anymore stage hedge funds private equity funds prop trading outfits goldman was a big leader in shedding the stuff they figured was taboo even before the final rules were written and now weve entered the next stage the building new things that we think we can have stage in this stage wall street firms will attempt to do things that are a lot like what they used to do — but in new ways using new kinds of legal loopholes because the old ones were sewn shut with volcker thread goldman is once again taking the lead in this business ordinary folks will think this means wall street is getting around the volcker rule but thats why they are so ordinary on wall street this is called compliance the new thing goldman is going to start doing is running a credit fund for wealthy customers that will invest in the unrated debt of midsized companies this will replace the old thing goldman did to run a credit fund for wealthy customers that wanted to invest in risky debt the old things at goldman were called hedge funds the new thing is called a businessdevelopment company actually businessdevelopment companies — or bdc if you want to sound knowing — arent really all that new theyve been around for decades they just werent all that attractive to investment banks that could run hedge funds which were less regulated goldmans new businessdevelopment company will be called goldman sachs liberty harbor capital llc — probably because the guy who came up with this idea has an office that looks out at the statue of liberty in new york harbor it will sell shares to investors in a private placement liberty harbor will then borrow money to enhance its ability to buy up loads of debt that has never been rated by a creditrating agency the managers of gs liberty harbor llc — lets call it gosaliha pronounced go sell it ha — are a bunch of guys — and maybe some gals but this is wall street so you know probably not — who went over to goldman after their old hedge fund amaranth advisors imploded back in  you will have to try not to confuse gosaliha with a hedge fund run by these same people called liberty harbor which is part of goldman sachss assetmanagement group liberty harbor manages about  billion in assets according to a fund prospectus that was one of the old things goldman did and although its still doing this thing because the volcker prohibitions are phased in over eternity eventually goldmans desire to run the fund without being able to own a major part of it will diminish ominously when gosaliha was first uncovered by reuters matt goldstein back in january it was run by greg felton he has since left goldman no one knows why it will now be run by raanan agus the cohead of goldman sachs investment partners which is another hedge fund run by goldman but please remember this isnt a hedge fund or a private equity company there are many things a hedge fund or privateequity company could theoretically do that a bdc cannot do the law limits the amount of debt a bdc can take on to an amount equal to its equity bdcs cannot have single positions that are larger than  percent of their portfolio most importantly they are also required to have most percent of their assets in privately issued securities of private companies not listed on any national exchange but they can also do things that hedge funds could not like take in investors who arent super wealthy investors do not need to meet the income net worth or sophistication criteria imposed on privateequity investment so these things can be sold to ordinary investors — although that certainly is not goldmans plan it has too many extraordinary investors to even think about selling to ordinary folk bonus regulatory compliance goldman said in its public filings that this bdc will also count as an emerginggrowth company under jumpstart our business startups act of  this means it can take advantage of reduced reporting rules meant to encourage tech startups to go public so none of those pesky sarbanesoxley audited internal controls requirements and if goldman were to ipo this thing the bank doing the underwriting could produce research reports touting it what does it mean to have a credit fund that counts as a startup for disclosure and a business development company run by wall streets premier investment bank no one really knows as far as i can tell no one ever contemplated what would happen if someone put hedgefund managers specializing in risky credit in charge of a bdc that is also a jobs act emerginggrowth company or at least no one who wasnt at goldman sachs ever did but what could go wrong get the latest goldman sachs stock price hereread the original article on netnet
