description crossreference to related application this application claims priority to provisional application no  filed mar   which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety technical field this application is directed to compositions and methods relating to tissue repair using allogeneic microvascular tissue or cells background tendon injuries are very common sprains will heal spontaneously but complete tears will often lead to disability if not surgically treated despite surgical repairs about  of achilles tendons and  of two tendon rotator cuff repairs subsequently fail furthermore the repaired tendons seldom return to preinjury strength and function levels attempts to improve the success rate have involved better suture and bone anchors new surgical methods and patches to reinforce the repair and provide scaffolding for tissue ingrowth to thicken the tendon there are also reports of improved tendon healing using growth factors such as bmp bmp pdgfbb and bfgf in preclinical models although some researchers have indicated tendon as a possible tissue to grow using mesenchymal stem cells msc very little work has been done along that line there is even less work reported with adipose or other microvascular tissuederived stem or progenitor cells it has been shown that fresh cells from adipose and other microvascular tissues could be used for regenerating orthopedic tissues others have since shown that these cells help treat tendon lesions in horse models of tendon injury as well as other conditions these cells were always autologous or syngeneic however the use of autologous sourced stem cells is inconvenient it requires two surgical procedures with associated pain cost and morbidity there are also risks in shipping the tissue to the lab for processing and a delay in treatment of the injury or disease recently bone graft products have been launched that use uncultured bone marrow cells from allogeneic donors adsorbed to bone chips or demineralized bone matrix dbm however this type of product is unsuitable for softtissue repair and requires special handling to preserve the bone marrow cells summary embodiments of the described

described herein is a process that generates allogeneic ie allogeneic or xenogeneic processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue which is ready to use offtheshelf when needed also described is the use of processed or cryopreserved allogeneic microvascular tissue for soft tissue eg tendon ligament skin and hard tissue healing the processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue provided herein is minimally processed uncultured microvascular tissue that includes a mixture of stem andor progenitor cells produced from the dissociation eg by enzymatic digestion of a microvascular tissue eg adipose tendon or muscle tissue processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can include additional molecules eg whole or fragmented extracellular matrix molecules growth factors or cell surface molecules the term “processed microvascular tissue” as used herein refers to microvascular tissue that is dissociated as described herein and then dried using for example a freezedrying or spray drying technique the term “cryopreserved microvascular tissue” as used herein refers to microvascular tissue that is dissociated as described herein and then cryopreserved using known techniques processed microvascular tissue and cryopreserved microvascular tissue have soft and hard tissue healing eg repair or regeneration activity as used herein “tissue healing activity” of a processed microvascular tissue is the ability of the provided processed microvascular tissue to facilitate improved healing eg repair or regeneration of a tissue eg hard or soft tissue exposed to the provided processed microvascular tissue as compared to an analogous tissue similarly treated but without exposure to a processed microvascular tissue improved healing is measured using any appropriate means such as time to complete healing amount of new tissue generated strength of the resulting healed tissue or functionality of the resulting healed tissue soft tissue includes tendons ligaments fascia skin fibrous tissues fat synovial membranes muscle nerves and blood vessels soft tissue injuries that can benefit from the soft tissue healing activity of the provided processed microvascular tissues include without limitation injuries such as tendon andor ligament tears and injuries resulting from ischemic events allogeneic and xenogeneic stem cells have not previously been used to facilitate repair of soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons because of the difficulty of producing new soft tissue with autologous stem cells and the perception that allogeneic and xenogeneic stem cells will be rejected in addition the research on stem cell preservation by freeze drying has been done on purified hematopoietic stem cells in order to increase viability in contrast the process and composition described herein does not rely on purified stem cells or cell viability rather the provided process is used to produce a processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue containing a mixture of cells including nonviable cells mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells and other molecules secreted by such cells eg cytokines growth factors chemotactic molecules and the like in some embodiments the processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue contains a mixture of viable and nonviable cells like autologous stem cell infusions the allogeneic stem andor progenitor cells in the provided processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue do not persist long in a patient but they trigger a cascade of responses in the patient that lead to improved healing the processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue described herein need not include viable or whole stem cells to induce improved soft tissue healing processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue described herein can be produced by dissociating a microvascular tissue in some embodiments the microvascular tissue is enzymatically digested using one or more enzymes suitable enzymes include those that contribute to cell dissociation such as collagenases and neutral proteases the enzymatic digestion process can be adjusted to increase or decrease cell dissociation for example if more complete cell dissociation is desired more than one enzyme can be included or digestion time can be increased while cell viability need not be maintained in some embodiments it is generally desired that cellular membranes remain generally intact to preserve membranes containing attachment and signaling molecules even if some cell lysis occurs during enzymatic digestion thus the use of enzymes such as lipidases may not be useful in such a process according to one embodiment of the present invention alternatively the microvascular tissue can be dissociated without the use of enzymes rather microvascular tissue can be dissociated using physical or chemical means including the use of chelators ultrasonic agitation or mechanical cell dissociation the procurement of donor microvascular tissue and subsequent treatment can include steps for preventing microbial eg bacterial fungal or viral contamination for example donors can be screened for a predetermined list of microbial organisms eg hiv hpv ebv tb etc prior to processing screening can be done using known techniques such as detecting the presence of a microbial nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction or by detecting the presence of a molecule associated with a particular microbe by elisa microbially contaminated microvascular tissue can be excluded from use according to some embodiments of the present invention in addition processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can be produced using aseptic or sterile techniques following tissue dissociation microvascular tissue can be further treated to remove undesired cells or molecules such as red blood cells lipids or adipocytes additional treatment will depend upon the source of microvascular tissue for example if the microvascular tissue source is adipose tissue the dissociated microvascular tissue can be centrifuged at relatively low force to separate lipids adipocytes and some preadipocytes from the rest of the microvascular tissue in other embodiments known muscle cell isolation protocols such as the use of density gradient centrifugation may be used to further treat muscle tissue following enzymatic digestion to remove muscle cells and enrich for desired cells once the microvascular tissue is prepared it is preserved dried using a freezedrying or spraydrying technique to produce processed microvascular tissue or is cryopreserved any appropriate excipient can be used when preserving microvascular tissue including sugars eg trehalose mannitol sucrose polyalcohols eg polyethylene glycol aldehydes proteins eg albumin amino acids eg glycine surfactants eg tween  dmso andor permanganates freeze drying typically involves four steps pretreatment freezing primary drying and secondary drying pretreatment can include concentration adjustment or the addition of one or more excipients following pretreatment the microvascular tissue is frozen the freezing step is typically done in a carefully controlled manner eg at a rate of cooling of between about −° c per minute to about −° c per minute to preserve cell structure however cell viability need not be preserved in some embodiments microvascular tissue is frozen at a rate of cooling of about −° c per minute the rate of cooling can be adjusted based on the particular microvascular tissue and excipients used the microvascular tissue can be frozen using any appropriate means including using mechanical refrigeration andor exposing a container containing the microvascular tissue to dry ice or liquid nitrogen until it reaches a temperature suitable for freeze drying during the primary drying step the temperature and pressure are adjusted to provide conditions suitable to cause sublimation of water from the microvascular tissue the specific temperature and pressure can be adjusted to accommodate the excipient used andor the concentration of the microvascular tissue during the secondary drying step the temperature and pressure can be further adjusted to facilitate the removal of unfrozen water from the microvascular tissue the final water content following the secondary drying step is preferably between  and  by weight but can be adjusted in order to maximize shelf life or soft tissue healing activity in some embodiments the microvascular tissue is spray dried prior to spray drying the microvascular tissue can be pretreated similarly to microvascular tissue that is to be freeze dried with the excipients being chosen as appropriate for spray drying rather than freeze drying during spray drying the microvascular tissue is atomized into droplets and exposed to heated air in a drying chamber in some embodiments microvascular tissue is not processed by drying but cryopreserved methods for cryopreserving tissue are known for example microvascular tissue is mixed with one or more excipients eg dmso and cooled in a carefully controlled manner in some embodiments cooling is done in two or more stages in which the first stage is done in a controlled manner eg reducing the temperature by ° c per minute to an intermediate temperature eg −° c with the second stage transferring cells at the intermediate temperature to a colder storage temperature eg −° c cryopreserved microvascular tissue is stored at a temperature suitable for maintaining the cryopreserved state eg from about −° c to −° c freeze dried or spray dried processed microvascular tissue can be stored in a wider variety of conditions than cryopreserved cells live cells or fresh tissue suitable temperatures for the storage for processed microvascular tissue include temperatures from about −° c to about ° c in some embodiments freeze dried or spray dried processed microvascular tissue can be stored at room temperature the shelf life of the provided processed microvascular tissue is at least one week and preferably at least one month while maintaining tissue healing activity additionally because viability is not required for suitability of the processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue for use in soft tissue repair the preservation process and storage need not be adjusted to maintain viability the percentage of viable cells in the provided microvascular tissue before processing or cryopreservation can be up to  after processing or cryopreservation it is less than  eg less than  less than  less than  or less than  in some embodiments the provided processed microvascular tissue contains no viable cells after processing or cryopreservation further provided are methods of using processed microvascular tissue processed microvascular tissue can be applied directly to a tissue in need of repair or can be applied to tissue surrounding such a tissue in need of repair in some embodiments a dried processed microvascular tissue is reconstituted in a suitable carrier eg water or saline and directly applied to a tissue in need of repair in some embodiments reconstituted processed microvascular tissue is applied to a scaffold such as a collagen matrix or biocompatible fabric prior to being applied to a tissue in other embodiments a processed microvascular tissue is used to coat a material such as a flexible biocompatible scaffold eg woven or nonwoven fabric sheets or thread biocompatible microbeads or particles or an implantable medical device spray dried processed microvascular tissue is particularly suited to coating a material comprising microbeads or particles without requiring reconstitution prior to coating as coating can be done during the spray drying process processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can be combined with any suitable device or material prior to implant into a patient processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can be combined with an orthopedic implant a porous flexible implantable scaffold a surgical implant pure water saline a porous coated implant polymer solution solvents such as dmso nmethylpyrrolidone nmp and alcohols hydrogel hyaluronic acid or other glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans collagen fibrin thrombin blood clot platelets platelet rich plasma demineralized bone matrix autologous cells andor cancellous bone processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can be packaged alone for example in a vial or in combination with other products such as those listed as being suitable for combination with processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue when packaged with another material the processed or cryopreserved microvascular tissue can be separately packaged or premixed or associated with the other material in some embodiments processed microvascular tissue is packaged as a coating on a biocompatible material the following examples are meant to illustrate specific embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention examples example  preparation of lyophilized

solution in phosphate buffered saline at  mgml resulting in a solution with a specific activity of  uml this collagenase solution was applied to the fat inguinal and epididymal pads were processed separately in an equal volume to weight ratio and incubated at ° c for  minutes while mixing collagenase activity was stopped with  bovine serum albumin and the cells were spun down as assessed by trypan blue exclusion cells collected from epididymal fat pads had a viability of about  while cells collected from inguinal fat pads had a viability of about  the cells were resuspended and counted epididymal fat yielded about  cells per ml and inguinal fat yielded about  cells per ml human microvascular tissue can be prepared using lipoaspirate that is enzymatically treated in a similar manner as the rat microvascular tissue lyophilization of microvascular tissue cells the collected cells were prepared for lyophilization in preservation medium  trehalose  hetastarch  albumin and  unitml heparin and placed into glass vials with stopper closures and crimp seals suitable for lyophilization to lyophilize the cells the lyophilizer temperature was dropped from ° c to −° c at a rate of ° c per minute temperature was held at −° c for  hours followed by a first drying step during the first drying step temperature was increased from −° c to −° c at a rate of ° c per minute and the pressure was reduced to  ton where the temperature and pressure were held for  hours a secondary drying step was then performed by increasing the temperature from −° c to −° c at a rate of  c per minute then held at ° c for  hours following the second drying step the vials were stoppered and crimp sealed under nitrogen viability assessment of microvascular tissue cells two days after lyophilization the cells were rehydrated and initial cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion cell metabolic function was assessed by measuring alamarblue® life technologies carlsbad calif metabolism according to the manufacturers instructions rehydrated cells were incubated in m™ medium incell san antonio tex supplemented with  fetal bovine serum in a t flask at ° c for  days to assess proliferation ability following rehydration the general structure of the cells appeared to be maintained in  of cells with a more exact calculation being difficult due to the appearance of many broken cells the cells had an initial viability of less than  with few cells retaining the ability to exclude trypan blue the morphology of those cells maintaining the ability to exclude trypan blue suggested they were undergoing apoptosis displaying enlarged nuclei and nuclear and cytoplasmic blebbing no significant ability to metabolize alamarblue® was observed indicating that metabolic integrity of the lyophilized cells was not maintained none of the cells were able to establish a culture in m™ medium confirming lowno viability of the lyophilized cells example  treatment of tendon damage using cryopreserved microvascular tissue preparation of cells from microvascular tissue microvascular tissue cells were prepared from rat epididymal fat pads as described in example  the cells were cryopreserved by resuspending the cells in mdef defined medium without supplements incell adding an equal volume of ezcpz incell with a final dmso concentration of  the cells were then frozen slowly in vials in a slow cool box overnight at −° c and then transferred to −° c viability of the cryopreserved cells was determined to be less than  as assessed using trypan blue exclusion viability

material resting in pbs the scaffold material was prewet with pbs prior to addition of microvascular tissue cells the cells were thawed quickly at ° c centrifuged at ×g for  minutes and resuspended at × cells per ml in phosphate buffered saline pbs the suspended cells were applied to the prewet scaffold material at a rate of  μl of the suspended cells per cm of scaffold material and allowed to absorb into the scaffold material by wicking action of the gauze beneath the scaffold material scaffold material was kept moist using pbs and allowed to incubate for  minutes at ° c and  co in a humid chamber microvascular tissue cellimpregnated scaffold material was kept moist and under aseptic conditions until use in achilles tendon model achilles tendon damage model prior to treatment  animals

with betadine and alcohol scrubs and draped using aseptic surgical techniques microvascular tissue cellimpregnated scaffold material was prepared immediately prior to implantation the graft was trimmed to  mm× mm and two of the corners were notched two  polypropylene sutures were placed in the graft for fixation the graft was then rolled to form a cylindrical structure for wrapping around the achilles tendon the graft was set aside in the petri dish with saline and covered until used a straight lateral skin incision was made from the caudal distal tibia of the right rear limb to the level of the mid tibia the skin was dissected and refracted to allow a lateral exposure of the achilles tendon from calcaneus to its musculotendinous junction the exposed achilles tendon was slightly abraded with mousetooth forceps prior to graft test article placement a single  mm drill hole was made in the lateral to medial direction through the calcaneus to allow suture passage for graft fixation the implant area was irrigated with saline to remove any debris and blotted dry the graft was removed from the saline and then wrapped around the achilles tendon with the notched ends adjacent to the calcaneus the graft edge was closed with interrupted  polypropylene sutures the cranial graft fixation suture was placed in the gastrocnemius cranial to the musculotendinous junction
