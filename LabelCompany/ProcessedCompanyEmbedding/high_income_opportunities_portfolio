first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other information about the portfolio read it carefully before you invest risk considerations an investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an understanding of the risks involved with an investment in a portfolio of common stocks and closedend funds common stocks are subject to certain risks such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective and to manage the funds portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying investments change unlike openend funds which trade at prices based on a current determination of the funds net asset value closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market certain closedend funds may employ the use of leverage which increases the volatility of such funds certain of the closedend funds invest in senior loans the yield on closedend funds which invest in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment senior loans are generally below investment grade quality junk bonds an investment in senior loans involves the risk that the borrowers may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due all of the closedend funds invest in highyield securities or junk bonds investing in highyield securities should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments that utilize such bonds highyield securities are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the junk bond market possible downgrades and defaults of interest andor principal highyield security prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree certain of the closedend funds in the portfolio invest in floatingrate securities a floatingrate security is an instrument in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in an interest rate benchmark as a result the yield on such a security will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment causing the trust to experience a reduction in the income it receives from such securities certain of the closedend funds invest in convertible securities convertible securities are bonds preferred stocks and other securities that pay a fixed rate of interest or dividends and will repay principal at a fixed date in the future however these securities may be converted into a specific number shares of common stocks at a specified time as such an investment in convertible securities entails some of the risks associated with both common stocks and bonds certain of the securities in the portfolio are issued by reits companies involved in the real estate industry are subject to changes in the real estate market vacancy rates competition volatile interest rates and economic recession all of the closedend funds invest in investment grade securities investment grade securities are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the investment grade security market or investors perception thereof possible downgrades and defaults of interest andor principal an investment in a portfolio containing smallcap and midcap companies is subject to additional risks as the share prices of smallcap companies and certain midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors including limited trading volumes products financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information an investment in foreign securities should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved with foreign issuers such as currency and interest rate fluctuations nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the us and developed foreign markets although this portfolio terminates in approximately  months the strategy is longterm investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios if available there may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an ira or other qualified plan the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers it is important to note that an investment can be made in the underlying funds directly rather than through the trust these direct investments can be made without paying the trusts

contributing to the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter a small postrestructuring equity holding benefited performance most an underweight and credit selection in the weakerperforming bb segment also had a positive impact credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over  for the quarter credit selection in the diversified media diversified financial services and chemicals categories had a positive effect on fund performance top individual contributors included an offbenchmark position in a gaming company a marketing firm and an air craft leasing firm detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter credit selection in the ccc and brated segments hurt fund performance largely because the fund favored higherquality less volatile bonds that lagged lowerquality issues credit selection among two to fiveyear duration bonds also detracted from fund performance along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less the funds quality bias in energy hindered performance credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted investment outlook and fund positioning  we think the backdrop for highyield bonds remains supportive going forward we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices while shortterm interest rates will likely increase we dont think the economy will overheat to t he point where the fed becomes overly aggressive what is less clear is when or if proposed progrowth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets some of the governments proposed initiatives if approved could have a positive effect on highyield bonds for example if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed that could on the margin lead to less new issuance i n highyield at the same time a lower tax rate on interest income earned by highincome filers could boost demand for high yield the implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the us economic recovery in turn aiding highyield fundamentals and driving down default rates we recognize however that there are also potential headwinds for the asset class volatility could be elevated especially given uncertainty over the republicans ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus a choppy market may dampen demand f or highyield bonds disappointing progress in washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure highyield bond returns additionally if opec organization of the petroleum exporting countrie s doesnt follow through on its planned production cuts oil prices could pull back further hurting the energy sectorgiven relatively high valuations on highyield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility weve kept the fund conserv atively positioned maintaining a shorter duration and higherquality bias than the

the year strong benefiting from postelection optimism regarding potential tax reform deregulation and fiscal stimulus favorable fourthquarter earnings reports and improving economic data also helped market conditions howev er weakened in march oil prices started to slide pressuring returns in energy the largest sector weighting in the bofa merrill lynch us high yield index the index in addition concern about an accelerated timetable for interest rate hikes sa pped investors appetite for risk undermining demand concurrently new highyield bond issuance surged as refinancings rose ahead of further interestrate increases or possible tax changes affecting the deductibility of interest expenses the federal r eserves feds march  decision to inch its key target rate higher had little impact on high yield but the asset class did see inflows pick up as expectations for the pace of future rate increases eased this tailwind was somewhat offset by republica ns inability to repeal and replace the affordable care act raising questions about when and if the new administration would be able to pass muchanticipated tax reform and meaningful fiscal stimulus highyield bond fundamentals continued to improve as evidenced by better revenue and earnings growth numbers corporate leverage modestly decreased for the second consecutive quarter due to improved earnings and interest coverage a measure of highyiel d issuers ability to service their debt obligations the trailing month default rate declined to  at quarter end down from  at the start of the year due to the fact that q s elevated defaults in the energy and metalsmining sectors have now rolled off the trailing month period the default rate exenergy and metalsmining issuers is currently  average yields on highyield bonds tightened to  and prices modestly improved for the three months ended march   the index returned  beating the  gain of the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index but lagging the  return of the sp  index within the index lowerquality and longerdurati on issues posted the strongest gains performance summary  eaton vance high income opportunities fund the fund posted a modest gain at net asset value for the quarter that was slightly behind the return of the index the funds higherquality lowervolatility bias notably in the cccrated segment and the energy sector protected the fund in march but hindered performance for the quarter as lowerquality issues outperformed duration positioning hampered performance largely because of the funds overweight in shorterduration issues which lagged longerduration bonds and credit selection in the two to fiveyear duration segment by contrast the fund benefited from an underweight and credit selection in the weakerperforming bb category credit selection was positive in the services diversified media diversified financial services and chemicals segments that generally benefited from expectations of improved economic growth historical returns

expense ratio  contributors  factors contributing to the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter a small postrestructuring equity holding benefited performance most an underweight and credit selection in the weakerperforming bb segment also had a positive impact credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over  for the quarter credit selection in the diversified media diversified financial services and chemicals categories had a positive effect on fund performance top individual contributors included an offbenchmark position in a gaming company a marketing firm and an air craft leasing firm detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter credit selection in the ccc and brated segments hurt fund performance largely because the fund favored higherquality less volatile bonds that lagged lowerquality issues credit selection among two to fiveyear duration bonds also detracted from fund performance along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less the funds quality bias in energy hindered performance credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted investment outlook and fund positioning  we think the backdrop for highyield bonds remains supportive going forward we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices while shortterm interest rates will likely increase we dont think the economy will overheat to t he point where the fed becomes overly aggressive what is less clear is when or if proposed progrowth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets some of the governments proposed initiatives if approved could have a positive effect on highyield bonds for example if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed that could on the margin lead to less new issuance i n highyield at the same time a lower tax rate on interest income earned by highincome filers could boost demand for high yield the implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the us economic recovery in turn aiding highyield fundamentals and driving down default rates we recognize however that there are also potential headwinds for the asset class volatility could be elevated especially given uncertainty over the republicans ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus a choppy market may dampen demand f or highyield bonds disappointing progress in washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure highyield bond returns additionally if opec organization of the petroleum exporting countrie s doesnt follow through on its planned production cuts oil prices could pull back further hurting the energy sectorgiven relatively high valuations on highyield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility weve kept the fund conserv atively positioned maintaining a shorter duration and higherquality bias than the index by protecting the funds downside and minimizing volatility we believe we can stay ahead of the index in market declines and capture much of the upside in rallies  helping to drive longterm relative performance at period end the funds duration was  years compared to the indexs duration of  years in addition the funds biggest credit concentration was in brated bonds which generally have less durat ion lower duration usually means bond prices decline less as credit spreads widen at periodend the fund had a small allocation to the higherquality splitrated bbbbb segment and in the ccc and b rated segments a bias toward less volatile issues in the energy sector weve continued to favor higherquality lowercost producers t hat in our view are less susceptible to price volatility during the quarter we added to some of our core exploration and production names and took advantage of opportunities in energy services our energy stake at quarter end was slightly underweigh t the sectors approximately  weight in the index in healthcare the second largest sector in the fund we had a bias toward bonds issued by healthcare services providers and companies that serve to reduce cost such as contract research organization s cros the fund was underweight hospital bonds which could be vulnerable to a repeal of the affordable care act and had a shorter duration focus in the pharmaceutical segment credit quality as of mar   bbb  bb  b  ccc or lower  not rated  total  credit ratings are categorized using sp if sp does not
